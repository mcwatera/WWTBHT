He is therein represented in a garb, half sailor's, half workman's, with no superfluous appendage of coat or waistcoat, a 'wide-awake' perched jauntily on his head, one hand in his pocket and the other on his hip, with a certain air of mild defiance, and an expression of pensive insolence in his face which seems to betoken a consciousness of his mission as the 'coming man.' This view of the author is confirmed in the preface. He vouchsafes, before introducing us to his poetry, to enlighten our benighted minds as to the true function of the American poet. Evidently the original, which is embodied in the most extraordinary prose since the 'Sayings' of the modern Orpheus, was found in the 'interior consciousness' of the writer. Of the materials afforded by this country for the operations of poetic art we have a lucid account.</p> <p>The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night. Here is not merely a nation but a teeming nation of nations. Here is action untied from strings, necessarily blind to particulars and details magnificently moving in vast masses. Here is the hospitality which forever indicates heroes\u2026Here are the roughs and beards and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul loves. Here the performance disdaining the trivial unapproached in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its perspective spreads with crampless and flowing breadth and showers its prolific and splendid extravagance. One sees it must indeed own the riches of the Summer and Winter, and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from the ground or the orchards drop apples or the bays contain fish or men beget children upon women.</p> <p> With veins full of such poetical stuff, the United States, as we are kindly informed, of all nations most needs poets, and will doubtless have the greatest and use them the greatest. Here is a full-length figure of the true poet:</p> <p>Of all mankind the great poet is the equable man. Not in him but off from him things are grotesque or eccentric or fail of their sanity. Nothing out of its place is good and nothing in its place is bad. He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportions, neither more nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse and he is the key. He is the equalizer of his age and land\u2026he supplies what wants supplying and checks what wants checking. If peace is the routine out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building vast and populous cities, encouraging agriculture and the arts and commerce\u2014lighting the study of man, the soul, immortality\u2014federal, state or municipal government, marriage, health, freetrade, intertravel by land and sea\u2026nothing too close, nothing too far off\u2026the stars not too far off. In war he is the most deadly force of the war. Who recruits him recruits horse and foot\u2026he fetches parks of artillery the best that engineer ever knew. If the time becomes slothful and heavy he knows how to arouse it\u2026he can make every word he speaks draw blood. Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or obedience or legislation, he never stagnates. Obedience does not master him, he masters it. High up out of reach he stands turning a concentrated light\u2026he turns the pivot with his finger\u2026he baffles the swiftest runners as he stands and easily overtakes and envelops them. The time straying toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by his steady faith\u2026he spreads out his dishes\u2026he offers the sweet firm-fibred meat that grows men and women. His brain is the ultimate brain. He is no arguer\u2026he is judgment. He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling around a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest he has the most faith. His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things. In the talk on the soul and eternity and God off of his equal plane he is silent. He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement\u2026he sees eternity in men and women\u2026he does not see men and women as dreams or dots. </p> <p>Of the nature of poetry the writer discourses in a somewhat too oracular strain, especially as he has been anticipated in his 'utterances' by Emerson and other modern 'prophets of the soul':</p><p>The poetic quality is not marshaled in rhyme or uniformity or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or recitations are not independent but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough\u2026the fact will prevail through the universe\u2026but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost. This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, reexamine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.</p><p>Such is the poetic theory of our nameless bard. He furnishes a severe standard for the estimate of his own productions. His Leaves of Grass are doubtless intended as an illustration of the natural poet. They are certainly original in their external form, have been shaped on no pre-existent model out of the author's own brain. Indeed, his independence often becomes coarse and defiant. His language is too frequently reckless and indecent though this appears to arise from a naive unconsciousness rather than from an impure mind. His words might have passed between Adam and Eve in Paradise, before the want of fig-leaves brought no shame; but they are quite out of place amid the decorum of modern society, and will justly prevent his volume from free circulation in scrupulous circles. With these glaring faults, the Leaves of Grass are not destitute of peculiar poetic merits, which will awaken an interest in the lovers of literary curiosities. They are full of bold, stirring thoughts\u2014with occasional passages of effective description, betraying a genuine intimacy with Nature and a keen appreciation of beauty\u2014often presenting a rare felicity of diction, but so disfigured with eccentric fancies as to prevent a consecutive perusal without offense, though no impartial reader can fail to be impressed with the vigor and quaint beauty of isolated portions. A few specimens will suffice to give an idea of this odd genius.</p> THERES MORE HERE <p>The volume contains many more 'Leaves of Grass' of similar quality, as well as others which cannot be especially commended either for fragrance or form. Whatever severity of criticism they may challenge for their rude ingenuousness, and their frequent divergence into the domain of the fantastic, the taste of not over dainty fastidiousness will discern much of the essential spirit of poetry beneath an uncouth and grotesque embodiment.</p>", "date": "July 23 1855", "year": 1855, "creator": "Charles A.

The poems, twelve in number, are neither in rhyme nor blank verse, but in a sort of excited prose broken into lines without any attempt at measure or regularity, and, as many readers will perhaps think, without any idea of sense or reason. The writer's scorn for the wonted usages of good writing; extends to the vocabulary he adopts; words usually banished from polite society are here employed without reserve and with perfect indifference to their effect on the reader's mind; and not only is the book one not to be read aloud to a mixed audience, but the introduction of terms, never before heard or seen, and of slang expressions, often renders an otherwise striking passage altogether laughable. But, as the writer is a new light in poetry, it is only fair to let him state his theory for himself. We extract from the preface:\u2014</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity, and the sunlight of letters is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity\u2014nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness***To speak in literature, with the perfect rectitude and the insouciance of the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods, is the flawless triumph of art***The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thought and things, without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or effect, or originality to hang in the way between me and the rest, like curtains. What I feel, I feel for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt, or startle, or fascinate, or soothe, I will have purposes, as health, or heat, or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my side to look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>The application of these principles, and of many others equally peculiar, which are expounded in a style equally oracular throughout the long preface,\u2014is made passim, and often with comical success, in the poems themselves, which may briefly be described as a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy. A fireman or omnibus driver, who had intelligence enough to absorb the speculations of that school of thought which culminated at Boston some fifteen or eighteen years ago, and resources of expression to put them forth again in a form of his own, with sufficient self-conceit and contempt for public taste to affront all usual propriety of diction, might have written this gross yet elevated, this superficial yet profound, this preposterous yet somehow fascinating book. As we say, it is a mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism, and, what must be surprising to both these elements, they here seem to fuse and combine with the most perfect harmony. The vast and vague conceptions of the one, lose nothing of their quality in passing through the coarse and odd intellectual medium of the other; while there is an original perception of nature, a manly brawn, and an epic directness in our new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school. But we have no intention of regularly criticising this very irregular production; our aim is rather to cull, from the rough and ragged thicket of its pages, a few passages equally remarkable in point of thought and expression. Of course we do not select those which are the most transcendental or the most bold:\u2014</p> <p>'I play not a march for victors only\u2026I<br>play great marches for conquered and<br>slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain<br>the day?<br>I also say it is good to fall\u2026battles are<br>lost in the same spirit in which they are<br>won.<br>I sound triumphal drums for the dead\u2026<br>I fling through my embouchures the<br>loudest and gayest music to them\u2014<br>Vivas to those who have failed, and to those<br>whose war-vessels sank in the sea, and to<br>those themselves who sank in the sea.<br>And to all generals that lost engagements,<br>and to all overcome heroes, and the number-<br>less unknown heroes equal to the<br>greatest heroes known.'<br>'I am the mashed fireman, with breast-bone<br>broken\u2026tumbling walls buried me in<br>their debris\u2014<br>Heat and smoke, I respired\u2026I heard<br>the yelling shouts of my comrades\u2014<br>I heard the distant click of their picks and<br>shovels.<br>They have cleared the beams away.\u2026<br>they tenderly lift me forth.<br>I lie in the night air in my red shirt\u2026<br>the pervading hush is for my sake.<br>Painless after all I lie, exhausted, but not so<br>unhappy.<br>White and beautiful are the faces around<br>me\u2026the heads are bared of their fire-<br>caps\u2014<br>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.'</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p> 'I tell not the fall of Alamo\u2026not one<br>escaped to tell the fall of the Alamo:<br>The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at<br>Alamo.<br>*****<br>They were the glory of the race of rangers,<br>Matchless with a horse, a rifle, a song, a<br>supper, or a courtship:<br>Large, turbulent, brave, handsome, gener-<br>ous, proud and affectionate\u2014<br>Bearded, sun-burnt, dressed in the free cos-<br>tume of hunters.'</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>'Did you read in the books of the old-<br>fashioned frigate fight?<br>Did you learn who won by the light of the<br>moon and stars?<br>Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you,<br>His was the English pluck, and there is<br>no tougher or truer, and never was, and<br>never will be:<br>Along the lowered eve he came, terribly<br>raking us.<br>We close with him: the yards entangled\u2026<br>the masts touched:<br>My captain lashed fast with his own hands.<br>We had received some eighteen-pound<br>shots under the water\u2014<br>On our lower gun-deck two large pieces<br>had burst at the first fire, killing all<br>around and blowing up, overhead.<br>Ten o'clock at night and the full moon shin-<br>ing, and the leaks on the gain, and five<br>feet of water reported;<br>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners in<br>the after-hold, to give them a chance for<br>themselves.<br>The transit to and from the magazine was<br>now stopped by the sentinels\u2014<br>They saw so many strange faces, they did<br>not know whom to trust.<br>Our frigate was a-fire\u2014the other asked if<br>we demanded quarters? if our colors were<br>struck and the fighting done?<br>I laughed content when I heard the voice<br>of my little captain\u2014<br>`We have not struck,' he composedly cried.<br>`We have just begun our part of the<br>fighting.'<br>Only three guns were in use.<br>One was directed by the captain himself,<br>against the enemy's mainmast:<br>Two, well served with grape and canister,<br>silenced his musketry and cleared his<br>decks.<br>*****<br>Not a moment's cease \u2014<br>The leaks gained fast on the pumps\u2026the fire eat toward the<br>powder magazine:<br>One of the pumps was shot away; it was generally thought we<br>were sinking.<br>Serene stood the little captain:<br>He was not hurried\u2026his voice was neither high or low\u2014<br>His eyes gave more light to us than our battle-lanterns.<br>Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they<br>surrendered to us.'</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>'As to you, life, I reckon you are the leav-<br>ings of many deaths:<br>No doubt I have died myself ten thousand<br>times before.<br>I hear you whispering there, O stars of<br>heaven\u2014<br>O suns!

This, no doubt, is upon the principle that the name is merely accidental; while the portrait affords an idea of the essential being from whom these utterances proceed. We must add, however, that this significant reticence does not prevail throughout the volume, for we learn on p. 29, that our poet is 'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos.' That he was an American, we knew before, for, aside from America, there is no quarter of the universe where such a production could have had a genesis. That he was one of the roughs was also tolerably plain; but that he was a kosmos, is a piece of news we were hardly prepared for. Precisely what a kosmos is, we trust Mr. Whitman will take an early occasion to inform the impatient public.</p>", "date": "September 1855", "year": 1855, "creator": "Charles Eliot Norton", "publication": "Putnam's Monthly: A Magazine of Literature, Science, and Arts", "citation": "Norton, Charles Eliot [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)].\" September 1855.

One of the roughs, large, proud, affectionate, eating, drinking, and breeding, his costume manly and free, his face sunburnt and bearded, his posture strong and erect, his voice bringing hope and prophecy to the generous races of young and old. We shall cease shamming and be what we really are. We shall start an athletic and defiant literature. We realize now how it is, and what was most lacking. The interior American republic shall also be declared free and independent.</p><p>For all our intellectual people, followed by their books, poems, novels, essays, editorials, lectures, tuitions, and criticism, dress by London and Paris modes, receive what is received there, obey the authorities, settle disputes by the old tests, keep out of rain and sun, retreat to the shelter of houses and schools, trim their hair, shave, touch not the earth barefoot, and enter not the sea except in a complete bathing-dress. One sees unmistakably genteel persons, travelled, college-learned, used to be served by servants, conversing without heat or vulgarity, supported on chairs, or walking through handsomely-carpeted parlors, or along shelves bearing well-bound volumes, and walls adorned with curtained and collared portraits, and china things, and nick-nacks. But where in American literature is the first show of America? Where are the gristle and beards, and broad breasts, and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the souls of the people love? Where is the tremendous outdoors of these States? Where is the majesty of the federal mother, seated with more than antique grace, calm, just, indulgent to her brood of children, calling them around her regarding the little and the large and the younger and the older with perfect impartiality? Where is the vehement growth of our cities? Where is the spirit of the strong rich life of the American mechanic, farmer, sailor, hunter, and miner? Where is the huge composite of all other nations, cast in a fresher and brawnier matrix, passing adolescence, and needed this day, live and arrogant, to lead the marches of the world?</p><p>Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all the attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature, talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such a being as a writer. Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior. Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of the old theories and forms. Every phrase announces new laws; not once do his lips unclose except in conformity with them. With light and rapid touch he first indicates in prose the principles of the foundation of a race of poets so deeply to spring from the American people, and become ingrained through them, that their Presidents shall not be the common referees so much as that great race of poets shall. He proceeds himself to exemplify this new school, and set models for their expression and range of subjects. He makes audacious and native use of his own body and soul. He must re-create poetry with the elements always at hand. He must imbue it with himself as he is, disorderly, fleshy, and sensual, a lover of things, yet a lover of men and women above the whole of the other objects of the universe. His work is to be achieved by unusual methods. Neither classic or romantic is he, nor a materialist any more than a spiritualist. Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk and rhyme of poetry\u2014not the first recognition of gods or goddesses, or Greece or Rome. No breath of Europe, or her monarchies, or priestly conventions, or her notions of gentlemen and ladies founded on the idea of caste, seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs. But in their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age, and the realities of this mighty continent, and the sciences and inventions and discoveries of the present world. Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor physiology, nor engineering, is more true to itself than Walt Whitman is true to them. They and the other sciences underlie his whole superstructure. In the beauty of the work of the poet, he affirms, are the tuft and final applause of science.</p><p>Affairs then are this man's poems. He will still inject nature through civilization. The movement of his verses is the sweeping movement of great currents of living people, with a general government, and state and municipal governments, courts, commerce, manufactures, arsenals, steamships, railroads, telegraphs, cities with paved streets, and aqueducts, and police and gas\u2014myriads of travellers arriving and departing\u2014newspapers, music, elections and all the features and processes of the nineteenth century in the wholesomest race and the only stable form of politics at present upon the earth. Along his words spread the broad impartialities of the United States. No innovations must be permitted on the stern severities of our liberty and equality. Undecked also is this poet with sentimentalism, or jingle, or nice conceits or flowery similes. He appears in his poems surrounded by women and children, and by young men, and by common objects and qualities. He gives to each just what belongs to it, neither more or less. The person nearest him, that person he ushers hand in hand with himself. Duly take places in his flowing procession, and step to the sounds of the newer and larger music, the essences of American things, and past and present events\u2014the enormous diversity of temperature and agriculture and mines\u2014the tribes of red aborigines\u2014the weather-beaten vessels entering new ports, or making landings on rocky coasts\u2014the first settlements north and south\u2014the rapid stature and impatience of outside control\u2014the sturdy defiance of '76, and the war and peace, and the leadership of Washington, and the formation of the Constitution\u2014the Union always calm and impregnable\u2014the perpetual coming of immigrants\u2014the wharf-hemmed cities and superior marine\u2014the unsurveyed interior\u2014the log-house, and clearings, and wild animals, and hunters, and trappers\u2014the fisheries, and whaling, and gold-digging\u2014the endless gestation of new states\u2014the convening of Congress every December, the members coming up from all climates, and from the utter-most parts\u2014the noble character of the free American workman and workwoman\u2014the fierceness of the people when well-roused\u2014the ardor of their friendships\u2014the large amativeness\u2014the Yankee swap\u2014the New York fireman, and the target excursion\u2014the southern plantation life\u2014the character of the north-east, and of the north-west and south-west\u2014and the character of America and the American people everywhere. For these the old usages of poets afford Walt Whitman no means sufficiently fit and free, and he rejects the old usages. The style of the bard that is waited for is to be transcendent and new. It is to be indirect and not direct or descriptive or epic. Its quality is to go through these to much more. Let the age and wars (he says) of other nations be chanted, and their eras and characters be illustrated, and that finish the verse. Not so (he continues) the great psalm of the republic. Here the theme is creative and has vista. Here comes one among the well-beloved stonecutters, and announces himself, and plans with decision and science, and sees the solid and beautiful forms of the future where there are now no solid forms.</p><p>The style of these poems, therefore, is simply their own style, new-born and red. Nature may have given the hint to the author of the 'Leaves of Grass', but there exists no book or fragment of a book, which can have given the hint to them. All beauty, he says, comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. His rhythm and uniformity he will conceal in the roots of his verses, not to be seen of themselves, but to break forth loosely as lilies on a bush, and take shapes compact as the shapes of melons, or chestnuts, or pears.</p><p>The poems of the 'Leaves of Grass' are twelve in number. Walt Whitman at first proceeds to put his own body and soul into the new versification:<p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>He leaves houses and their shuttered rooms, for the open air. He drops disguise and ceremony, and walks forth with the confidence and gayety of a child. For the old decorums of writing he substitutes new decorums. The first glance out of his eyes electrifies him with love and delight. He will have the earth receive and return his affection; he will stay with it as the bride-groom stays with the bride. The cool-breathed ground, the slumbering and liquid trees, the just-gone sunset, the vitreous pour of the full moon, the tender and growing night, he salutes and touches, and they touch him. The sea supports him, and hurries him off with its powerful and crooked fingers. Dash me with amorous wet! then he says, I can repay you.</p><p>By this writer the rules of polite circles are dismissed with scorn. Your stale modesties, he says, are filthy to such a man as I.</p><p>'I believe in the flesh and the appetites,<br>Seeing, hearing, and feeling are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.<br>I do not press my finger across my mouth,<br>I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart.'</p><p>No sniveller, or tea-drinking poet, no puny clawback or prude, is Walt Whitman. He will bring poems fit to fill the days and nights\u2014fit for men and women with the attributes of throbbing blood and flesh. The body, he teaches, is beautiful. Sex is also beautiful. Are you to be put down, he seems to ask, to that shallow level of literature and conversation that stops a man's recognizing the delicious pleasure of his sex, or a woman hers? Nature he proclaims inherently pure. Sex will not be put aside; it is a great ordination of the universe. He works the muscle of the male and the teeming fibre of the female throughout his writings, as wholesome realities, impure only by deliberate intention and effort. To men and women he says: You can have healthy and powerful breeds of children on no less terms than these of mine. Follow me and there shall be taller and nobler crops of humanity on the earth.</p><p>In the 'Leaves of Grass' are the facts of eternity and immortality, largely treated. Happiness is no dream, and perfection is no dream. Amelioration is my lesson, he says with calm voice, and progress is my lesson and the lesson of all things. Then his persuasion becomes a taunt, and his love bitter and compulsory. With strong and steady call he addresses men. Come, he seems to say, from the midst of all that you have been your whole life surrounding yourself with. Leave all the preaching and teaching of others, and mind only these words of mine.</p><p>'Long enough have you dreamed contemptible dreams,<br>Now I wash the gum from your eyes,<br>You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your<br>life.<br>Long have you timidly waded, holding a plank by the shore,<br>Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,<br>To jump off in the midst of the sea, and rise again and nod to me and shout, and<br>laughingly dash with your hair.<br>I am the teacher of athletes,<br>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,<br>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.<br>The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own<br>right,<br>Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br>Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than a wound cuts,<br>First rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff; to sing or play<br>on the banjo,<br>Preferring scars and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers and those that<br>keep out of the sun.<br>I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?<br>I follow you whoever you are from the present hour;<br>My words itch at your ears till you understand them.<br>I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat;<br>It is you talking just as much as myself\u2014I act as the tongue of you.<br>It was tied in your mouth\u2014in mine it begins to be loosened.<br>I swear I will never mention love or death inside a house,<br>And I swear I never will translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately<br>stays with me in the open air.'</p><p>The eleven other poems have each distinct purposes, curiously veiled. Theirs is no writer to be gone through with in a day or a month. Rather it is his pleasure to elude you and provoke you for deliberate purposes of his own.</p><p>Doubtless in the scheme this man has built for himself the writing of poems is but a proportionate part of the whole. It is plain that public and private performance, politics, love, friendship, behavior, the art of conversation, science, society, the American people, the reception of the great novelties of city and country, all have their equal call upon him and receive equal attention. In politics he could enter with the freedom and reality he shows in poetry. His scope of life is the amplest of any yet in philosophy. He is the true spiritualist. He recognizes no annihilation, or death, or loss of identity. He is the largest lover and sympathizer that has appeared in literature. He loves the earth and sun, and the animals. He does not separate the learned from the unlearned, the Northerner from the Southerner, the white from the black, or the native from the immigrant just landed at the wharf. Every one, he seems to say, appears excellent to me, every employment is adorned, and every male and female glorious.</p><p>'The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,<br>They scorn the best I can do to relate them.<br>I am enamored of growing out-doors,<br>Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,<br>Of the builders and steerers of ships, of the wielders of axes and mauls, of the<br>drivers of horses,<br>I can eat and sleep with them, week in and week out.<br>What is commonest and cheapest and nearest and easiest is Me,<br>Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,<br>Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,<br>Not asking the sky to come down to my good will.<br>Scattering it freely for ever.'</p><p>If health were not his distinguishing attribute, this poet would be the very harlot of persons. Right and left he flings his arms, drawing men and women with undeniable love to his close embrace, loving the clasp of their hands, the touch of their necks and breasts, and the sound of their voice. All else seems to burn up under his fierce affection for persons. Politics, religion, institutions, art, quickly fall aside before them. In the whole universe, he says, I see nothing more divine than human souls.</p><p>'When the psalm sings instead of singer,<br>When the script preaches instead of the preacher,<br>When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the support-<br>ing desk,<br>When the sacred vessels or the bits of the eucharist, or the lath and plast, procre-<br>ate as effectually as the young silversmiths or bakers, or the masons in their<br>overalls,<br>When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince,<br>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's daughter,<br>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly companions,<br>I intend to reach them my hand and make as much of them as I make of men and<br>women.'</p><p>Who then is that insolent unknown? Who is it, praising himself as if others were not fit to do it, and coming rough and unbidden among writers to unsettle what was settled, and to revolutionize, in fact, our modern civilization? Walt Whitman was born on Long-Island, on the hills about thirty miles from the greatest American city, on the last day of May, 1819, and has grown up in Brooklyn and New York to be thirty-six years old, to enjoy perfect health, and to understand his country and its spirit.</p><p>Interrogations more than this, and that will not be put off unanswered, spring continually through the perusal of these Leaves of Grass:</p><p>If there were to be selected, out of the incalculable volumes of printed matter in existence, any single work to stand for America and her times, should this be the work?</p><p>Must not the true American poet indeed absorb all others, and present a new and far more ample and vigorous type?</p><p>Has not the time arrived for a school of live writing and tuition consistent with the principles of these poems? consistent with the free spirit of this age, and with the American truths of politics? consistent with geology, and astronomy, and all science and human physiology? consistent with the sublimity of immortality and the directness of common-sense?</p><p>If in this poem the United States have found their poetic voice, and taken measure and form, is it any more than a beginning? Walt Whitman himself disclaims singularity in his work, and announces the coming after him of great successions of poets, and that he but lifts his finger to give the signal.</p><p>Was he not needed? Has not literature been bred in and in long enough? Has it not become unbearably artificial?</p><p>Shall a man of faith and practice in the simplicity of real things be called eccentric, while the disciple of the fictitious school writes without question?</p><p>hall it still be the amazement of the light and dark that freshness of expression is the rarest quality of all?</p><p>You have come in good time, Walt Whitman! In opinions, in manners, in costumes, in books, in the aims and occupancy of life, in associates, in poems, conformity to all unnatural and tainted customs passes without remark, while perfect naturalness, health, faith, self-reliance, and all primal expressions of the manliest love and friendship, subject one to the stare and controversy of the world.</p>", "date": "September 1855", "year": 1855, "creator": "Walt Whitman", "publication": "The United States Review", "citation": "Whitman, Walt [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman and His Poems.\" September 1855.

It sets all the ordinary rules of criticism at defiance. It is one of the strangest compounds of transcendentalism, bombast, philosophy, folly, wisdom, wit and dullness which it ever entered into the heart of man to conceive. Its author is Walter Whitman, and the book is a reproduction of the author. His name is not on the frontispiece, but his portrait, half length, is. The contents of the book form a daguerreotype of his inner being, and the title page bears a representation of its physical tabernacle. It is a poem; but it conforms to none of the rules by which poetry has ever been judged. It is not an epic nor an ode, nor a lyric; nor does its verses move with the measured pace of poetical feet\u2014of Iambic, Trochaic or Anapaestic, nor seek the aid of Amphibrach, of dactyl or Spondee, nor of final or cesural pause, except by accident. But we had better give Walt's own conception of what a poet of the age and country should be. We quote from the preface:</p><p>'Other States indicate themselves in their deputies, but the genius of the United States is not best or most in executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors, or colleges, or churches, or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors; but always most in the common people, their manners, speech, dress, friendship\u2014the friendship and candor of their physiognomy\u2014the picturesque looseness of their carriage\u2014their deathless attachment to freedom\u2014their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft or mean, the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of all other States\u2014the fierceness of their roused resentments\u2014their curiosity and welcome of novelty\u2014their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy\u2014their susceptibility of a slight\u2014the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors\u2014the fluency of their speech\u2014their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul\u2014their good temper and open handedness\u2014the terrible significance of their elections\u2014the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him\u2014these too are unrhymed poetry.'</p><p>But the poetry which the author contemplates must reflect the nation as well as the people themselves.</p><p>'His spirit responds to his country's spirit; he incarnates its geography and natural life, and rivers and lakes. Mississippi with annual freshets and changing chutes, Missouri, and Columbia, and Ohio, and the beautiful masculine Hudson, do not embouchure where they spend themselves more than they embouchure into him. The blue breadth over the inland sea of Virginia and Maryland, and the sea of Massachusetts and Maine, over Manhattan Bay, and over Champlain and Erie, and over Ontario and Huron, and Michigan and Superior, and over the Texan, and Mexican, and Floridian and Cuban seas, and over the seas of California and Oregon, is not tallied by the blue breadth of the waters below more than the breadth of above and below is tallied by him.</p><p>. . . 'To him enter the essence of the real things, and past and present events\u2014of the enormous diversity of temperature, and agriculture, and mines\u2014the tribes of red aborigines\u2014the weather-beaten vessels entering new ports or making landings on rocky coasts\u2014the first settlement North and South\u2014the rapid stature and muscle\u2014the haughty defiance of '76, and the war, and peace, and formation of the constitution \u2014the union surrounded by blatherers, and always impregnable\u2014the perpetual coming of immigrants\u2014the wharf-hemmed cities and superior marine\u2014the unsurveyed interior\u2014the log houses, and clearings, and wild animals, and hunters, and trappers\u2014the free commerce, the fishing, and whaling, and gold digging\u2014the endless gestation of new States\u2014the convening of Congress every December, the members duly coming up from all climates and the uttermost parts\u2014the noble character of the young mechanics, and of all free American workmen and workwomen\u2014the general ardor, and friendliness, and enterprise\u2014the perfect equality of the female with the male\u2014the large amativeness\u2014the fluid movement of the population,' &c.**</p><p>'For such the expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and new.'</p><p>And the poem seems to accord with the ideas here laid down. No drawing room poet is the author of the 'Leaves of Grass;' he prates not of guitar thrumming under ladies' windows, nor deals in the extravagances of sentimentalism; no pretty conceits or polished fancies are tacked together 'like orient pearls at random strung;' but we have the free utterance of an untramelled spirit without the slightest regard to established models or fixed standards of taste. His scenery presents no shaven lawns or neatly trimmed arbors; no hot house conservatory, where delicate exotics odorise the air and enchant the eye. If we follow the poet we must scale unknown precipices and climb untrodden mountains; or we boat on nameless lakes, encountering probably rapids and waterfalls, and start wild fowls never classified by Wilson or Audubon; or we wander among primeval forests, now pressing the yielding surface of velvet moss, and anon caught among thickets and brambles. He believes in the ancient philosophy that there is no more real beauty or merit in one particle of matter than another; he appreciates all; every thing is right that is in its place, and everything is wrong that is not in its place. He is guilty, not only of breaches of conventional decorum but treats with nonchalant defiance what goes by the name of refinement and delicacy of feeling and expression. Whatever is natural he takes to his heart; whatever is artificial (in the frivolous sense) he makes of no account. The following description of himself is more truthful than many self-drawn pictures:</p><p>'Apart from the pulling and hauling, stands what I<br>am,<br>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle,<br>unitary,<br>Looks down, is erect, bends an arm on an impalpa-<br>ble certain rest,<br>Looks with its side-curved head curious, what will<br>come next,<br>Both in and out of the game, and watching and won-<br>dering at it.'</p><p>As a poetic interpretation of nature, we believe the following is not surpassed in the range of poetry:</p><p>'A child said, What is grass! fetching it to me with full<br>hands;<br>How could I answer the child! I do not know any<br>more than he.<br>I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord;<br>A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly drop-<br>ped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway on the corners,<br>that we may see, and remark, and say, Whose?</p><p>We are afforded glimpses of half-formed pictures to tease and tantalize with their indistinctness: like a crimson cheek and flashing eye looking on us through the leaves of an arbor\u2014mocking us for a moment, but vanishing before we can reach them. Here is an example:</p><p>'Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;<br>Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly.<br>Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lone-<br>some.<br>She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;<br>She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds<br>of the window.<br>Which of the young men does she like the best?<br>Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.<br>Dancing and laughing along the beach came the<br>twenty-ninth bather;<br>The rest did not see her, but she saw them, &c.'</p><p>Well, did the lady fall in love with the twenty-ninth bather, or vice versa? Our author scorns to gratify such puerile curiosity; the denouement which novel readers would expect is not hinted at.</p><p>In his philosophy justice attains its proper dimensions:</p><p>'I play not a march for victors only: I play great<br>marches for conquered and slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say that it is good to fall\u2014battles are lost in<br>the same spirit in which they are won.<br>I sound triumphal drums for the dead\u2014I fling thro'<br>my embouchures the loudest and gayest music<br>for them.<br>Vivas to those who have failed and to those whose<br>war vessels sank in the sea.<br>And to those themselves who sank into the sea.<br>And to all generals that lost engagements, and all<br>overcome heroes and the numberless unknown<br>heroes equal to the greatest heroes known.'</p><p>The triumphs of victors had been duly celebrated, but surely a poet was needed to sing the praises of the defeated whose cause was righteous, and the heroes who have been trampled under the hoofs of iniquity's onward march.</p><p>He does not pick and choose sentiments and expressions fit for general circulation\u2014he gives a voice to whatever is, whatever we see, and hear, and think, and feel. He descends to grossness, which debars the poem from being read aloud in any mixed circle. We have said that the work defies criticism; we pronounce no judgment upon it; it is a work that will satisfy few upon a first perusal; it must be read again and again, and then it will be to many unaccountable. All who read it will agree that it is an extraordinary book, full of beauties and blemishes, such as nature is to those who have only a half formed acquaintance with her mysteries.</p>", "date": "September 15 1855", "year": 1855, "creator": "unknown [unsigned in original]", "publication": "The Brooklyn Daily Eagle", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"'Leaves of Grass'\u2014An Extraordinary Book.\" 15 September 1855.

As first-rate or natural objects, in their perfect simplicity and proportion, do not startle or strike, but appear no more than matters of course, so probably natural poetry does not, for all its being the rarest, and telling of the longest and largest work. The artist or writer whose talent is to please the connoisseurs of his time, may obey the laws of his time, and achieve the intense and elaborated beauty of parts. The perfect poet cannot afford any special beauty of parts, or to limit himself by any laws less than those universal ones of the great masters, which include all times, and all men and women, and the living and the dead. For from the study of the universe is drawn this irrefragable truth, that the law of the requisites of a grand poem, or any other complete workmanship, is originality, and the average and superb beauty of the ensemble. Possessed with this law, the fitness of aim, time, persons, places, surely follows. Possessed with this law, and doing justice to it, no poet or any one else will make anything ungraceful or mean, any more than any emanation of nature is.</p><p>The poetry of England, by the many rich geniuses of that wonderful little island, has grown out of the facts of the English race, the monarchy and aristocracy prominent over the rest, and conforms to the spirit of them. No nation ever did or ever will receive with national affection any poets except those born of its national blood. Of these, the writings express the finest infusions of government, traditions, faith, and the dependence or independence of a people, and even the good or bad physiognomy, and the ample or small geography. Thus what very properly fits a subject of the British crown may fit very ill an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect, is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; everything receives its tinge from that. In the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakspeare just as much as the rest, there is the air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakspeare, represented in America, is not an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone never silent in their plots and characters be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson was the most enormous of liars, and common persons,north and south, should bow low to their betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops.</p><p>English versification is full of these danglers, and America follows after them. Every body writes poetry, and yet there is not a single poet. An age greater than the proudest of the past is swiftly slipping away, without one lyric voice to seize its greatness, and speak it as an encouragement and onward lesson. We have heard, by many grand announcements, that he was to come, but will he come?</p><p>'A mighty Poet whom this age shall choose<br>To be its spokesman to all coming times.<br>In the ripe full-blown season of his soul,<br>He shall go forward in his spirit's strength,<br>And grapple with the questions of all time,<br>And wring from them their meanings. As King Saul<br>Called up the buried prophet from his grave<br>To speak his doom, so shall this Poet-king<br>Call up the dread past from its awful grave<br>To tell him of our future. As the air<br>Doth sphere the world, so shall his heart of love\u2014<br>Loving mankind, not peoples. As the lake<br>Reflects the flower, tree, rock, and bending heaven,<br>Shall he reflect our great humanity;<br>And as the young Spring breathes with living breath<br>On a dead branch, till it sprouts fragrantly<br>Green leaves and sunny flowers, shall he breathe life<br>Through every theme he touch, making all Beauty<br>And Poetry forever like the stars.'\u2014Alexander Smith.</p><p>The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy, and their combination into love. This love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakspeare the same as the rest. It is possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connection with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female.</p><p>Poetry, to Tennyson and his British and American eleves, is a gentleman of the first degree, boating, fishing, and shooting genteelly through nature, admiring the ladies, and talking to them, in company, with that elaborate half-choked deference that is to be made up by the terrible license of men among themselves. The spirit of the burnished society of upper-class England fills this writer and his effusions from top to toe. Like that, he does not ignore courage and the superior qualities of men, but all is to show forth through dandified forms. He meets the nobility and gentry half-way. The models are the same both to the poet and the parlors. Both have the same supercilious elegance, both love the reminiscences which extol caste, both agree on the topics proper for mention and discussion, both hold the same undertone of church and state, both have the same languishing melancholy and irony, both indulge largely in persiflage, both are marked by the contour of high blood and a constitutional aversion to anything cowardly and mean, both accept the love depicted in romances as the great business of a life as a poem, both seem unconscious of the mighty truths of eternity and immortality, both are silent on the presumptions of liberty and equality, and both devour themselves in solitary lassitude. Whatever may be said of all this, it harmonizes and represents facts. The present phases of high-life in Great Britain are as natural a growth there, as Tennyson and his poems are a natural growth of those phases. It remains to be distinctly admitted that this man is a real first-class poet, infused amid all that ennui and aristocracy.</p><p>Meanwhile a strange voice parts others aside and demands for its owner that position that is only allowed after the seal of many returning years has stamped with approving stamp the claims of the loftiest leading genius. Do you think the best honors of the earth are won so easily, Walt Whitman? Do you think city and country are to fall before the vehement egotism of your recitative of yourself?</p><p>'I am the poet of the body,<br>And I am the poet of the soul.<br>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell<br>are with me,<br>The first I graft and increase upon myself\u2026the latter I<br>translate into a new tongue.<br>I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br>And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,<br>And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.<br>I chant a new chant of dilation or pride,<br>We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,<br>I show that size is only development.'</p><p>It is indeed a strange voice! Critics and lovers and readers of poetry as hitherto written, may well be excused the chilly and unpleasant shudders which will assuredly run through them, to their very blood and bones, when they first read Walt Whitman's poems. If this is poetry, where must its foregoers stand? And what is at once to become of the ranks of rhymesters, melancholy and swallow-tailed, and of all the confectioners and upholsterers of verse, if the tan-faced man here advancing and claiming to speak for America and the nineteenth hundred of the Christian list of years, typifies indeed the natural and proper bard?</p><p>'The friendly and flowing savage.

Not the refined life of the drawing-room\u2014not dancing and polish and gentility, but some powerful uneducated person, and some harsh identity of sound, and all wild free forms, are grateful to him. A thrill of his own likeness strikes him as the spotted hawk wheels noisily near his head at nightfall, and he is fain to say,</p><p>'I too am not a bit tamed\u2014I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>He is sterile on the old myths, and on all the customary themes of romantic and classical writers, but pregnant with the deductions of the geologist, the astronomer, the great antiquary, the chemist, the phrenologist, the spiritualist, the mathematician, and with the ideas and practice of American politics. Individuals and personal incidents are not given by him at second-hand: he himself assumes and becomes any character, one after another\u2014the child uttering fancies about the grass\u2014the curious meditator reclining on a bank of a summer forenoon, and holding a long colloquy of love with his own soul\u2014the friendly mate and companion of people\u2014now riding from the fields atop of the load of hay on its way to the barn\u2014or in the most crowded rush of a great city\u2014or hunting alone over the mountains or far in the wilds\u2014sailing in the Yankee clipper under her three skysails\u2014one of a chowder-party with boatmen or clam-diggers\u2014giving shelter to the runaway slave\u2014beholding the marriage of the trapper to the red girl in the far west\u2014or bathing with bathers by the sea-side\u2014absorbing all pleasures and all pains\u2014learning lessons of animals and birds\u2014merged in any affair or person\u2014in the carpenter dressing his plank\u2014the pilot who seizes the kingpin of the wheel\u2014the driver who drives the dray of the stone-yard\u2014the spinning girl advancing forward and retreating backward\u2014the canal-boy on the tow-path\u2014the pavior with his wooden beetle\u2014the drover singing out to his drove\u2014the Wolverine setting traps by the Huron\u2014the Missourian crossing the plains with his wares and his cattle\u2014the flatboatman making fast at night near the shores of cottonwood and pekan-tree\u2014the hunter and trapper resting after their day's sport in the hut of adobe\u2014the mourning widow looking out on the winter midnight\u2014the Yankee or the Texan\u2014the Georgian, the lumberer of Maine, the Kentuckian, Ohian, Louisianian, or Californian\u2014mechanic, author, artist or shoolboy\u2014thinker of the thoughts of all men in all ages\u2014appreciator of the nearest and readiest, and traveller from the most distant and diverse.</p><p>The theory and practice of poets have hitherto been to select certain ideas or events or personages, and then describe them in the best manner they could, always with as much ornament as the case allowed. Such are not the theory and practice of the new poet. He never presents for perusal a poem ready-made on the old models, and ending when you come to the end of it; but every sentence and every passage tells of an interior not always seen, and exudes an impalpable something which sticks to him that reads, and pervades and provokes him to tread the half-invisible road where the poet, like an apparition, is striding fearlessly before. If Walt Whitman's premises are true, then there is a subtler range of poetry than that of the grandeur of acts and events, as in Homer, or of characters, as in Shakspeare\u2014poetry to which all other writing is subservient, and which confronts the very meanings of the works of nature and competes with them. It is the direct bringing of occurrences and persons and things to bear on the listener or beholder, to re-appear through him or her; and it offers the best way of making them a part of him and her as the right aim of the greatest poet.</p><p>Of the spirit of life in visible forms\u2014of the spirit of the seed growing out of the ground\u2014of the spirit of the resistless motion of the globe passing unsuspected but quick as lightning along its orbit\u2014of them is the spirit of this man's poetry. Like them it eludes and mocks criticism, and appears unerringly in results. Things, facts, events, persons, days, ages, qualities, tumble pell-mell, exhaustless and copious, with what appear to be the same disregard of parts, and the same absence of special purpose, as in nature. But the voice of the few rare and controlling critics, and the voice of more than one generation of men, or two generations of men, must speak for the inexpressible purposes of nature, and for this haughtiest of writers that has ever yet written and printed a book. He is to prove either the most lamentable of failures or the most glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature. And after all we have written we confess our brain-felt and heart-felt inability to decide which we think it is likely to be.</p>", "date": "October 1855", "year": 1855, "creator": "Walt Whitman", "publication": "American Phrenological Journal", "citation": "Whitman, Walt [unsigned in original]. \"An English and an American Poet.\" October 1855.

Leaves of Grass 1855.</p><p>An unconsidered letter of introduction has oftentimes procured the admittance of a scurvy fellow into good society, and our apology for permitting any allusion to the above volume in our columns is, that it has been unworthily recommended by a gentleman of wide repute, and might, on that account, obtain access to respectable people, unless its real character were exposed.</p><p>Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson either recognises and accepts these 'leaves,' as the gratifying results of his own peculiar doctrines, or else he has hastily endorsed them, after a partial and superficial reading. If it is of any importance, he may extricate himself from the dilemma. We, however, believe that this book does express the bolder results of a certain transcendental kind of thinking, which some have styled philosophy.</p><p>As to the volume itself, we have only to remark, that it strongly fortifies the doctrines of the Metempsychosists, for it is impossible to imagine how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth, unless he were possessed of the soul of a sentimental donkey that had died of disappointed love. This poet (?) without wit, but with a certain vagrant wildness, just serves to show the energy which natural imbecility is occasionally capable of under strong excitement.</p><p>There are too many persons, who imagine they demonstrate their superiority to their fellows, by disregarding all the politenesses and decencies of life, and, therefore, justify themselves in indulging the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license. But nature, abhorring the abuse of the capacities she has given to man, retaliates upon him, by rendering extravagant indulgence in any direction followed by an insatiable, ever-consuming, and never to be appeased passion.</p><p>Thus, to these pitiful beings, virtue and honor are but names. Bloated with self-conceit, they strut abroad unabashed in the daylight, and expose to the world the festering sores that overlay them like a garment. Unless we admit this exhibition to be beautiful, we are at once set down for non-progressive conservatives, destitute of the 'inner light,' the far-seeingness which, of course, characterize those gifted individuals. Now, any one who has noticed the tendency of thought in these later years, must be aware that a quantity of this kind of nonsense is being constantly displayed. The immodesty of presumption exhibited by these seers; their arrogant pretentiousness; the complacent smile with which they listen to the echo of their own braying, should be, and we believe is, enough to disgust the great majority of sensible folks; but, unfortunately, there is a class that, mistaking sound for sense, attach some importance to all this rant and cant. These candid, these ingenuous, these honest 'progressionists;' these human diamonds without flaws; these men that have come, detest furiously all shams; 'to the pure, all things are pure;' they are pure, and, consequently, must thrust their reeking presence under every man's nose.</p><p>They seem to think that man has no instinctive delicacy; is not imbued with a conservative and preservative modesty, that acts as a restraint upon the violence of passions, which, for a wise purpose, have been made so strong. No! these fellows have no secrets, no disguises; no, indeed! But they do have, conceal it by whatever language they choose, a degrading, beastly sensuality, that is fast rotting the healthy core of all the social virtues.</p><p>There was a time when licentiousness laughed at reproval; now it writes essays and delivers lectures. Once it shunned the light; now it courts attention, writes books showing how grand and pure it is, and prophesies from its lecherous lips its own ultimate triumph.</p><p>Shall we argue with such men? Shall we admit them into our houses, that they may leave a foul odor, contaminate the pure, healthful air? Or shall they be placed in the same category with the comparatively innocent slave of poverty, ignorance and passion, that skulks along in the shadows of by-ways; even in her deep degradation possessing some sparks of the Divine light, the germ of good that reveals itself by a sense of shame?</p><p>Thus, then, we leave this gathering of muck to the laws which, certainly, if they fulfil their intent, must have power to suppress such gross obscenity. As it is entirely destitute of wit, there is no probability that any one would, after this exposure, read it in the hope of finding that; and we trust no one will require further evidence\u2014for, indeed, we do not believe there is a newspaper so vile that would print confirmatory extracts.</p><p>In our allusions to this book, we have found it impossible to convey any, even the most faint idea of its style and contents, and of our disgust and detestation of them, without employing language that cannot be pleasing to ears polite; but it does seem that some one should, under circumstances like these, undertake a most disagreeable, yet stern duty. The records of crime show that many monsters have gone on in impunity, because the exposure of their vileness was attended with too great indelicacy.

With your Lake Schools, and Border-Thief Schools, and Cockney and Satanic Schools, there has been enough to do; and now, all these Schools having been burnt or smouldered themselves out, and left nothing but a wide-spread wreck of ashes, dust, and cinders\u2014or perhaps dying embers, kicked to and fro under the feet of innumerable women and children in the magazines, and at best blown here and there into transient sputters, what remains but to adjust ourselves to circumstances? Urge me not, [continues this desperate litterateur] with considerations that Poetry, as the inward Voice of Life, must be perennial; only dead in one form to become alive in another; that this still abundant deluge of Metre, seeing there must needs be fractions of Poetry floating, scattered in it, ought still to be net-fished; at all events, surveyed and taken note of. The survey of English metre, at this epoch, perhaps transcends the human faculties; to hire out the reading of it by estimate, at a remunerative rate per page, would, in a few quarters, reduce the cash-box of any extant review to the verge of insolvency.</p><p>Such is the humorous but essentially truthful picture of the condition and product of the creative faculties during the second quarter of the present century. The great poets, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Goethe, and Schiller, had fulfilled their tasks and gone to other spheres; and all that remained with few exceptions, were weak and feeble echoes of their dying strains, caught up and repeated by numerous imitators and pretenders. And so has it ever been; the visions and perceptions of one man become the creed and superficial life-element of other minds. Swedenborg1 is worthy to be enrolled among the master minds of the world, because he entered for himself into the Arcana of the profoundest mysteries that can concern human intelligences; his greatest thoughts are revolved, quoted and represented in all 'New Church' publications, but very rarely digested and assimilated by those who claim to be his followers. Still more rare is it to find any receiver of 'the heavenly doctrines' determined to enter for himself into the very interiors of all that Swedenborg taught\u2014to see, to the mighty reflections that Swedenborg was able to give of interior realities, but their originals as they stand constellated in the heavens!</p><p>But Divine Providence, leading forth the race, as a father the tottering steps of his children, causes the outward form, on which all men are prone to rely, to be forever changing and passing away before their eyes. The seeds of death are ever found luring in the fairest external appearances, till those externals become the mere correspondences and representatives of interior realities, and then, though enduring as the fadeless garments of the blest, they are ever-varying, as those robes of light change with each changing state. The Coming Age will recognize the profoundest truths in the internal thought of the Swedish sage, while his most tenacious adherents will be forced to admit that, in externals, he often erred, and was not unfrequently deceived. But the discovered error will not only wean them from a blind and bigoted reliance upon frail man, but confirm the sincere lovers of truth in loyalty to her standard. So also, the spiritualists are being taught a severe but salutary lesson, that if they will penetrate into the heavenly Arcana of the Inner Life, they must do so by purifying and elevating their own minds, and not by 'sitting in circles' or ransacking town and country to find the most 'reliable Mediums.' Still no step in human progress and development is in vain; even the falls of the child are essential to his discipline. The mistakes and errors of men are needful while in their present imperfect state. They are to the seekers of truth what trials and losses are to those in the pursuit of wealth; they but enhance the value of the prize, and confirm the devotion of the true aspirant as frowns rekindle the ardor of lovers.</p><p>Moreover, as man must ever enter into the kingdom of a new unfolding truth with the simplicity and teachableness of little children, it is well that the outer form of the old disappear, that the new may stand alone in its place. It seems also to be a Law that when a change entire and universal is to be outwrought, the means preparatory to its introduction shall be equally widespread, and ultimated to the lowest possible plane. Hence the Spiritual manifestations meet the most external minds; and allow even the unregenerate to know by experience the fact and process of Spiritual inspiration; so that scepticism becomes impossible to the candid and living mind. The second step will be, after such have been convinced that Spiritual intercourse is possible, that they learn that it is worse than useless for the purpose of attaining anything desirable, beyond this conviction\u2014except so far as is orderly and directed, not by the will of man, but of God. But as the old form of poetic inspiration died out with Byron and Shelley, Wordsworth and Goethe, and the miscellaneous Spirit-intercourse itself also as quickly passes away, there will, we apprehend, spring up forms of mediatorial inspiration, of which there will be two permanent types. The first and highest, as it seems to us, will be the opening of the interiors to direct influx to the inspiring sources of love and wisdom. The heavens will flow down into the hearts and lives, into the thought and speech of harmonic natures, as the silent dews impregnate the patient earth. Men will live in heaven, hence they must be inspired by that breath of life that fills its ethereal expanse. A second class of Media will be used for the ultimation, for ends of use and in accordance with Laws of Order, of the creative thoughts and hymns, the Epics and Lyrics, of individual Spirits and societies of Spirits. These will be to the former Media as the youthful artist who copies the work of a master, to the Angelos and Raphaels, who both design and execute their plans, though they themselves, in their deepest interiors, are instructed and sustained from above.</p><p>But in the transition period in which we now are, many varieties of Mediumship must be expected. There are those who stand in rapport with the diseased mentalities of the past and present and pour forth as Divine Revelations the froth and scum of a receding age; they are the sponges who absorb the waste and impurities of humanity. They are also like running sores that gather the corrupt humors and drain the body of its most noxious fluids. There are others who come in contact with the outmost portion of the Spirit-life. These give crude, and in themselves, false notions of the state of man after death; yet they prepare the way for more truthful disclosures; if in no other way by stimulating the appetite for more substantial nourishment. There are those who are lifted by genial inspirations to receive influxes from the upper mind-sphere of the age. They stand, as it were, on clear mountains of intellectual elevation, and with keenest perception discern the purer forms of new unfolding truths ere they become sufficiently embodied to be manifest to the grosser minds of the race. Of these Ralph Waldo Emerson is the highest-type. He sees the future of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man; he welcomes those impalpable forms, as Spiritualists receive with gladdened minds the returning hosts of Spirit-friends.</p><p>There are other mediatorial natures who are in mental and heart-sympathy with man, as he now is, struggling to free himself from the tyranny of the old and effete, and to grasp and retain the new life flowing down from the heavens. And as the kindling rays at first produce more smoke than fire, so their lay is one of promise rather than performance. Such we conceive to be the interior condition of the author of Leaves of Grass. He accepts man as he is as to his whole nature, and all men as his own brothers. The lambent flame of his genius encircles the world\u2014nor does he clearly discern between that which is to be preserved, and that which is but as fuel for the purification of the ore from its dross. There is a wild strength, a Spartan simplicity about the man, and he stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation, like a drunken Hercules amid the dainty dancers. That his song is highly mediatorial he himself asserts, though probably he is unacquainted with the Spiritual developments of the age.</p><p>Through me [he sings] many long dumb voices,<br>Voices of the interminable generations of slaves,<br>Voices of the diseased and despairing.<br>Voices of the cycles of preparation and accretion,<br>And of threads that connect the stars,<br>And of the rights of them the others are down upon.<br>Through me forbidden voices\u2014voices veiled,<br>Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured.</p><p>We omit much even in this short extract, for the book abounds in passages that cannot be quoted in drawing-rooms, and expressions that fall upon the tympanums of ears polite, with a terrible dissonance. His very gait, as he walks through the world, makes dainty people nervous; and conservatives regard him a social revolution. His style is everywhere graphic and strong, and he sings many things before untouched in prose or rhyme in an idiom that is neither prose nor rhyme, nor yet orthodox blank verse. But it serves his purpose well. He wears strange garb, cut and made by himself, as gracefully as a South American cavalier his poncho. We will continue our quotations.</p><p>Such are the graphic pictures which this new world-painter flings from his easel and dashes upon the moving panorama of life. His night-thoughts are not less striking, as borne by the Muse, he looks into every chamber, and hears the quiet breathing of slumbering humanity.</p><p>As the volume advances towards its conclusion, the Spirit of the poet becomes calmer and more serenely elevated. But everywhere his sympathy is with man, and not with conventionalisms.</p><p>We cannot take leave of this remarkable volume without advising our friends who are not too delicately nerved, to study the work as a sign of the times, written as we perceive, under powerful influxes; a prophecy and promise of much that awaits all who are entering with us into the opening doors of a new era. A portion of that thought which broods over the American nation, is here seized and bodied forth by a son of the people, rudely, wildly, and with some perversions, yet strongly and genuinely, according to the perception of this bold writer. He is the young Hercules who has seized the serpents that would make him and us their prey; but instead of strangling, he would change them to winged and beautiful forms, who shall become the servants of mankind.</p>", "date": "1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "anonymous", "publication": "The Christian Spiritualist", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)].\" 1856.

The loftiest attainment of the wisdom and worth of age only reaches to the simplicity and fervor of childhood, from which we all start, and returning to which we are blessed. Art makes the same voyage round its sphere, holding ever westward its way into new and unexplored regions, until it does what Columbus would have done, had his faith and self-denial been greater, reaches the east again. If the individual, Columbus, failed to accomplish the destiny, the class, Columbus, fails never. And so in Art, what no one does, the many accomplish, and finally the cycle is filled.</p><p>We see this most forcibly in the comparison of two late poems, as unlike, at first thought, as two could be, and yet in which the most striking likenesses prevail, 'MAUD,' and 'LEAVES OF GRASS;'\u2020 the one as refined in its Art as the most refined, delicate in its structure, and consummate in its subtlety of expression, the other rude and rough, and heedless in its forms\u2014nonchalant in everything but its essential ideas. The one comes from the last stage of cultivation of the Old World, and shows evidence of morbid, luxurious waste of power, and contempt of mental wealth, from inability longer to appreciate the propriety of subjects on which to expend it; as, to one who has overlived, all values are the same, because nothing, and indifferent; while the other, from among the 'roughs,' is morbid from overgrowth, and likewise prodigal of its thought-treasure, because it has so much that it can afford to throw it away on everything, and considers all things that are, as equally worth gilding. The subject of MAUD is nothing\u2014a mere common-place incident, but artistically dealt with\u2014a blanched, decayed sea-shell, around which the amber has gathered; and that of the newer poem is equally nothing, blades of sea-grass amber-cemented. Both are characterized by the extreme of affectation of suggestiveness\u2014piers of thought being given, over which the reader must throw his own arches. Both are bold, defiant of laws which attempt to regulate forms, and of those which should regulate essences. Maud is irreligious through mental disease, produced by excess of sentimental action\u2014'Leaves of Grass', through irregularly-developed mental action and insufficiency of sentiment. A calmer perception of Nature would have corrected in Tennyson that feeling which looks upon sorrow as the only thing poetic, and serenity and holy trust, as things to which Love has no alliance, while a higher seeing of Nature would have shown Walt Whitman that all things in Nature are not alike beautiful, or to be loved and honored by song.</p><p>Although it is mainly with the Art of the two poems that we have to deal, the form rather than the motive, yet so entirely does the former arise from the latter that the criticism passed on the one must lie upon the other. In the mere versification,for instance, of both, see what indifference to the dignity of verse (while there is still the extorted homage to its forms), arising in both cases, it would seem, from an overweening confidence in the value of what is said, as in the following passages:</p><p>'Long have I sighed for a calm; God grant I may find it at last!It will never be broken by Maud, she has neither savor nor salt,But a cold, clear, cut face, as I found when her carriage past,Perfectly beautiful: let it be granted her: where is the fault?'</p><p>Maud, Sec. ii., St. 1.</p><p>'Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now.<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward<br>annihilation?<br>Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,<br>Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good.<br>The whole universe indicates that it is good.<br>The past and present indicates that it is good.'</p><p>Leaves of Grass, p. 69.</p><p>All Tennyson's exquisite care over his lines produces no other impression than that which Whitman's carelessness arrives at; viz., nonchalance with regard to forms. In either case, it is an imperfection, we are bold to say, since we do not love beauty and perfection of form for nothing, nor can the measure of poetic feeling be full when we do not care for the highest grace and symmetry of construction. It is an impertinence which says to us, 'my ideas are so fine that they need no dressing up,' even greater than that which says, 'mine are so fine that they cannot be dressed as well as they deserve.' The childlike instinct demands perfect melody as an essential to perfect poetry, and more than that, the melodious thought will work out its just and adequate form by the essential law of its spiritual organization\u2014when the heart sings, the feet will move to its music. An unjust measure in verse is prima facie evidence of a jarring note in the soul of the poem, and studied or permitted irregularity of form proves an arrogant self-estimation or irreverence in the poet; and both these poems are irreverent, irreligious, in fact. Maud commences, singularly enough, with the words, 'I hate,' and the whole sentiment of the poem ignores the nobler and purer feelings of humanity\u2014it is full of hatred and morbid feeling, diseased from pure worldliness. This is well enough for one whom the world calls a laureate, but the true poet seeks a laurel that the world cannot gather, growing on mountains where its feet never tread, he lives with beauty and things holy, or, if evil things come to him, it is that they may be commanded behind him. 'Maud' rambles and raves through human love and human hate, and the hero lives his life of selfish desire and selfish enjoyment, and then through the bitterness of selfish regret and despair, without one thought of anything better, nobler than himself\u2014the summit of creation. He worships nothing, even reverences nothing, his love is only passion, and his only thought of God one of fear. In his happiness, he is a cynic, in his unhappiness, a madman.</p><p>For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the<br>veil.<br>Who knows the ways of the world, how God will bring<br>them about?<br>Our planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide.<br>Shall I weep if a Poland fail? shall I shriek if a Hun-<br>gary fail?<br>Or an infant civilization be ruled with rod or with<br>nout?<br>I have not made the world, and He that made it will<br>guide.<br>Be mine a philosopher's life in the quiet woodland<br>ways,<br>Where if I cannot be gay let a passionless peace be my<br>lot,<br>Far off from the clamor of liars belied in the hubbub<br>of lies;<br>From the long-neck'd geese of the world that are ever<br>hissing dispraise<br>Because their natures are little, and, whether he heed<br>it or not,<br>Where each man walks with his head in a cloud of<br>poisonous flies.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Dead, long dead,<br>Long dead!<br>And my heart is a handful of dust,<br>And the wheels go over my head,<br>And my bones are shaken with pain,<br>For into a shallow grave they are thrust,<br>Only a yard beneath the street,<br>And the hoofs of the horses beat, beat,<br>The hoofs of the horses beat,<br>Beat into my scalp and my brain,<br>With never an end to the stream of passing feet,<br>Driving, hurrying, marrying, burying,<br>Clamor and rumble, and ringing and clatter,<br>And here beneath it is all as bad,<br>For I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;<br>To have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?<br>But up and down and to and fro,<br>Ever about me the dead men go;<br>And then to hear a dead man chatter<br>Is enough to drive one mad.<br>Wretchedest age, since Time began,<br>They cannot even bury a man;<br>And tho' we paid our tithes in the days that are<br>gone,<br>Not a bell was rung, not a prayer was read;<br>It is that which makes us loud in the world of the<br>dead;<br>There is none that does his work, not one;<br>A touch of their office might have sufficed,<br>But the churchmen fain would kill their church,<br>As the churches have kill'd their Christ.<br>See, there is one of us sobbing,<br>No limit to his distress;<br>And another, a lord of all things, praying<br>To his own great self, as I guess;<br>And another, a statesman there, betraying<br>His party-secret, fool, to the press;<br>And yonder a vile physician, blabbing<br>The case of his patient\u2014all for what?<br>To tickle the maggot born in an empty head,<br>And wheedle a world that loves him not,<br>For it is but a world of the dead.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' is irreligious, because it springs from a low recognition of the nature of Deity, not, perhaps, so in intent, but really so in its result. To Whitman, all things are alike good\u2014no thing is better than another, and thence there is no ideal, no aspiration, no progress to things better. It is not enough that all things are good, all things are equally good, and, therefore, there is no order in creation; no better, no worse\u2014but all is a democratic level from which can come no symmetry, in which there is no head, no subordination, no system, and, of course, no result. With a wonderful vigor of thought and intensity of perception, a power, indeed, not often found, 'Leaves of Grass' has no ideality, no concentration, no purpose\u2014it is barbarous, undisciplined, like the poetry of a half-civilized people, and, as a whole, useless, save to those miners of thought who prefer the metal in its unworked state. The preface of the book contains an inestimable wealth of this unworked ore\u2014it is a creed of the material, not denying the ideal, but ignorant of it.</p><p>'The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into anything that was before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe. He is a seer\u2026he is individual\u2026he is complete in himself\u2026the others are as good as he, only he sees it and they do not. He is not one of the chorus\u2026he does not stop for any regulation: he is the president of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest he does to the rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible, or baseless, or vague? after you have once just opened the space of a peachpit, and given audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion, or jostling, or jam.</p><p>'The land and sea, the animals, fishes, and birds, the sky of heaven and the orbs, the forests, mountains, and rivers, are not small themes\u2026but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb, real objects\u2026they expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty well enough\u2026probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters, woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens, and orchards, and fields, the love of healthy women for the manly form, sea-faring persons, drivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence of the poetic in out-door people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive\u2026some may, but they never can. The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme, or uniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws, and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts, and oranges, and melons, and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems, or music, or orations, or recitations, are not independent, but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough\u2026the fact will prevail through the universe\u2026but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.</p><p>*****</p><p>'The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself.

I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is.

The author printed it himself, and it seems to have been left to the winds of heaven to publish it. So it happened that we had not discovered it before our last number, although we believe the sheets had then passed the press. It bears no publisher's name, and, if the reader goes to a bookstore for it, he may expect to be told at first, as we were, that there is no such book, and has not been. Nevertheless, there is such a book, and it is well worth going twice to the bookstore to buy it. Walter Whitman, an American,\u2014one of the roughs,\u2014no sentimentalist,\u2014no stander above men and women, or apart from them,\u2014no more modest than immodest,\u2014has tried to write down here, in a sort of prose poetry, a good deal of what he has seen, felt, and guessed at in a pilgrimage of some thirty-five years. He has a horror of conventional language of any kind. His theory of expression is, that, 'to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, is the flawless triumph of art.' Now a great many men have said this before. But generally it is the introduction to something more artistic than ever,\u2014more conventional and strained. Antony began by saying he was no orator, but none the less did an oration follow. In this book, however, the prophecy is fairly fulfilled in the accomplishment. 'What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>So truly accomplished is this promise,\u2014which anywhere else would be a flourish of trumpets,\u2014that this thin quarto deserves its name. That is to say, one reads and enjoys the freshness, simplicity, and reality of what he reads, just as the tired man, lying on the hill-side in summer, enjoys the leaves of grass around him,\u2014enjoys the shadow,\u2014enjoys the flecks of sunshine,\u2014not for what they 'suggest to him,' but for what they are.</p><p>So completely does the author's remarkable power rest in his simplicity, that the preface to the book\u2014which does not even have large letters at the beginning of the lines, as the rest has\u2014is perhaps the very best thing in it. We find more to the point in the following analysis of the 'genius of the United States,' than we have found in many more pretentious studies of it.</p><p>'Other states indicate themselves in their deputies, but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors;\u2014but always most in the common people. Their manners, speech, dress, riendships;\u2014the freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their deathless attachment to freedom, their aversion to everything indecorous or soft or mean, the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one State by the citizens of all other States, the fierceness of their roused resentment, their curiosity and welcome of novelty, their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy, their susceptibility to a slight, the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors, the fluency of their speech, their delight in music (the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul), their good temper and open-handedness, the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him,\u2014these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.'</p><p>The book is divided into a dozen or more sections, and in each one of these some thread of connection may be traced, now with ease, now with difficulty,\u2014each being a string of verses, which claim to be written without effort and with entire abandon. So the book is a collection of observations, speculations, memories, and prophecies, clad in the simplest, truest, and often the most nervous English,\u2014in the midst of which the reader comes upon something as much out of place as a piece of rotten wood would be among leaves of grass in the meadow, if the meadow had no object but to furnish a child's couch. So slender is the connection, that we hardly injure the following scraps by extracting them.</p><p>'I am the teacher of Athletes;<br>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own, proves the width of<br>my own;<br>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher;<br>The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not through derived power, but<br>in his own right,<br> Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br>Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse than a wound cuts,<br>First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's-eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a<br>song, or to play on the banjo,<br>Preferring scars, and faces pitted with small-pox, over all latherers and<br>those that keep out of the sun.'<br>Here is the story of the gallant seaman who rescued the passengers<br>on the San Francisco:\u2014<br>'I understand the large heart of heroes,<br>The courage of present times and all times;<br>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship,<br>and death chasing it up and down the storm,<br>How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of<br>days and faithful of nights,<br>And chalked in large letters on a board, 'Be of good cheer, we will not<br>desert you';<br>How he saved the drifting company at last,<br>How the lank, loose-gowned women looked when boated from the side of<br>their prepared graves,<br>How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipped,<br>unshaved men;<br>All this I swallowed, and it tastes good; I like it well, and it becomes<br>mine:<br>I am the man, I suffered, I was there.'</p><p>Claiming in this way a personal interest in every thing that has ever happened in the world, and, by the wonderful sharpness and distinctness of his imagination, making the claim effective and reasonable, Mr. 'Walt Whitman' leaves it a matter of doubt where he has been in this world, and where not. It is very clear, that with him, as with most other effective writers, a keen, absolute memory, which takes in and holds every detail of the past,\u2014as they say the exaggerated power of the memory does when a man is drowning,\u2014is a gift of his organization as remarkable as his vivid imagination. What he has seen once, he has seen for ever. And thus there are in this curious book little thumb-nail sketches of life in the prairie, life in California, life at school, life in the nursery,\u2014life, indeed, we know not where not,\u2014which, as they are unfolded one after another, strike us as real,\u2014so real that we wonder how they came on paper.</p><p>For the purpose of showing that he is above every conventionalism, Mr. Whitman puts into the book one or two lines which he would not address to a woman nor to a company of men. There is not anything, perhaps, which modern usage would stamp as more indelicate than are some passages in Homer. There is not a word in it meant to attract readers by its grossness, as there is in half the literature of the last century, which holds its place unchallenged on the tables of our drawing-rooms. For all that, it is a pity that a book where everything else is natural should go out of the way to avoid the suspicion of being prudish.</p>", "date": "January 1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "Edward Everett Hale", "publication": "The North American Review", "citation": "Hale, Edward Everett [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)].\" January 1856.

It is in every way a singular volume: singular in its form, singular in its arrangement, singular in its style, and most singular of all in its rhapsodical fancies. Its title-page, as will be seen, bears upon it the name of no author, and the book is ushered into the world without the patronage of any publisher to give it currency and protection. Of 'complimentary copies' for the press, none, so far as we are aware, have been vouchsafed by the writer. Ostrich-like, he has laid his egg in the sand and left it to quicken or not, according to that time and chance which, as the wise man says, happen to all things. We are not left, however, in the body of the work, wholly ignorant of the writer's name, profession, or age\u2014'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest,' is the odd fish who avows himself as the father of this odd volume. Walt Whitman is a printer by trade, whose punctuation is as loose as his morality, and who no more minds his ems than his p's and q's. He tells us that he was born on the last day of May, and 'passed from a babe in the creeping trance of three summers and three winters to articulate and walk,' all which he thinks 'wonderful;' while that he 'grew six feet high and became a man thirty-six years old in 1855, and that he is [I am] here any how,' are facts which he pronounces equally 'wonderful' in the wonder-world of his philosophy.</p><p>Though Walt Whitman has modestly withheld his name from the title-page of his production, he has favored us with his likeness by way of frontispiece to the volume. If the artist has faithfully depicted his effigy, Walt is indeed 'one of the roughs;' for his picture would answer equally well for a 'Bowery boy,'1 one of the 'killers,' 'Mose' in the play, 'Bill Sykes after the murder of Nancy,'2 or the 'B'hoy that runs with the engine,' much as we have known certain 'portraits taken from life' compelled to do duty in pictorial newspapers as the true likeness of half a dozen celebrated criminals. Walt Whitman is evidently the 'representative-man' of the 'roughs.'</p><p>The avowed object of Walter in the loose quarto before us is to 'celebrate' himself; and as the pastoral muse of Virgil 'meditated' on a slender oat straw, so Mr. Whitman 'leans and loafes' at his ease, 'observing a spear of summer grass.' Holy Writ informs us that 'all flesh is grass,' which, according to quaint old Sir Thomas Browne, is just as true literally as metaphorically; for all the adipose matter deposited in the human body from roast beef and mutton is, after all, at the bottom of the account only grass taking upon itself a coat of flesh, for grass forms the ox and roast beef forms the physical man; ergo, the most carnivorous gastronome, no less than the most immaculate vegetarian, is nothing but grass at the last chemical analysis of his constituents. Hence it will be seen that 'grass' is what Mr. Whitman calls a 'uniform hieroglyphic' of the whole human family, and as such deserves to be scanned by the minute philosopher.</p><p>A handful of grass fetched by a child to Walter Whitman inspires him with mysterious thoughts which he vainly essays to grasp, and hints intrusive questionings which he vainly endeavors to answer. At first he guesses that blades of grass 'must be the flag of his disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven,' and anon he guesses they are the 'handkerchief of the Lord,' designedly dropped from above 'as scented gifts and remembrancers.' He next guesses that 'the grass itself is a child, the produced babe of the vegetation,' and now he exclaims, in the next breath, 'it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves,' and hence he feels like caressing it, and breaks out in the following address to the 'curling grass:'</p><p>'It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;<br>It may be that if I had known them I would have loved them;<br>It may be that you are from old people and from women, and from<br>offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,<br>And here you are the mother's lap.</p><p>*****</p><p>What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br>And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br>They are alive and well somewhere.<br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death;<br>All goes onward and outward\u2026and nothing collapses,<br>And to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier.<br>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?<br>I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die, and I<br>know it.'</p><p>The reader who has proceeded only thus far begins already to discover that Walter Whitman is a pantheist. Without, perhaps, ever having read Spinoza, he is a Spinozist. Without, perhaps, much deep insight into Plato the divine, he is a Platonist 'in the rough,' and believes profoundly in the 'immanence of all in each,' without ever once mouthing that grand phrase of the Greek philosopher. With-out knowing how to chop the formal logic of the schools, he is a necessitarian and fatalist, with whom 'whatever is is right.' The world as he finds it, and man as he is, good or bad, high or low, ignorant or learned, holy or vicious, are all alike good enough for Walter Whitman, who is in himself a 'kosmos,' and whose emotional nature is at once the sensorium of humanity and the sounding board which catches up and intones each note of joy or sorrow in the 'gamut of human feeling.'</p><p>He represents himself as being alike of the old and the young, of the foolish as much as the wise; maternal in his instincts as well as paternal; a child as well as a man; a Southerner as soon as a Northerner; a planter, nonchalant and hospitable; a Yankee, bound his own way and ever ready for a swap; a Kentuckian, walking the trail of the Elkhorn with deerskin leggings; a boatman over the lakes or bays or along coasts; a Hoosier, a Badger, a Wolverine, a Buckeye, a Louisianian, a 'poke-easy' from sandbills and pines: at home equally on the hills of Vermont, or in the woods of Maine, or the Texas ranch; a learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfulest, a farmer, mechanic, or artist, a gentleman, sailor, lover, or quaker, a prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, or priest. He rejoices to feel that he is 'not stuck up and is in his [my] place,' for</p><p>'The moth and the fish eggs are in their place:<br>The suns I see and the suns I cannot see are in their place;<br>The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.'</p><p>So fully has the world-spirit possessed the soul of Walter that he thinks he could turn and live awhile with the animals; 'they are so placid and self-contained' that he sometimes 'stands and looks at them half the day long.'</p><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition;They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins;They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's philosophy, it will be seen, is somewhat different from Blaise Pascal's, and we hope we shall not hurt Mr. W's feelings if we venture to give to the devout Jansenist a slight precedence over him. Pascal, the poor man, having no better guides than his own august reason and the oracles of divine inspiration, in his profound speculations on the greatness and misery of man, came to the conclusion that man's consciousness of his misery was one of the most signal and primary proofs of his greatness. These anxious longings of the soul as for an unknown good were to his mind the indication of slumbering capacities not yet developed, and revealed that power of introspection and self-scrutiny which is at once the attribute of consciousness and the attestation of human responsibility. The man who degrades himself to the level of the brutes, or sinks even lower than they, does yet by his very nature rise above them in that he is conscious of his degradation. At least so thought Pascal, and so think still all those who find in man's consciousness the proof of his dignity and of his elevation above the brute creation.</p><p>Mr. Whitman thinks, however, he would like to turn and live awhile with the animals. Well, one's associates should certainly be determined according to one's tastes. Every one to his liking, as remarked the venerable dame in the proverb when she kissed her cow. De gustibus, &c. Mr. Whitman, it is true, can plead royal example and ancient precedent in defence of his 'passional attraction' towards the dumb animals. King Nebuchadnezzar, many years before him, consorted with the oxen of the field and went to graze after the most approved style of the bovine quadruped. We do not read, however, that his majesty greatly relished this species of out door life, and all, we doubt doubt [sic] because, 'unlike one of the roughs,' he failed to remark how 'placid and self-contained' were his companions of the herd. Nebuchadnezzar too, it is to be feared, lacked the proper pantheistic instincts to permit his entering fully into the sublime mysteries of Serapis3 and Anubis.4 If his life-experiences had been the same as 'Walt Whitman's' before undergoing his change, he might have managed better to enjoy his new society.</p><p>In the 'Golden Ass' of Apuleius we have also another record of life among the animals. We need not repeat the story of Fotis's ill-starred lover and his magical transformation into an ass, with the long series of misfortunes, the cudgellings and flayings which, sad to tell, befell him in that condition. Are they not all written in the 'golden' book aforesaid?\u2014a book which Mr. Whitman, we are sure, would find very much after his own heart in its freedom from anything like sentimental refinement or prudish delicacy, while it is to be hoped that its faithful portraiture of life among the graminivors [grass eaters] would cure him of his disposition to herd awhile with the quadrupeds, and render him willing to content himself with his present advantages in the privilege of 'standing and looking at them half the day long.' It behooves him also to bear in mind that according to all accounts the condition of the Irish peasantry is not greatly elevated over 'the rest of mankind' by their hereditary custom of assigning to the 'placid' porker and domestic cow a cozy corner in the cabin along with its other inmates. If much good was to be expected from turning and living with the animals, Ireland would have convinced the world of it long before Mr. Whitman's day, and if he had properly studied her history we question whether he would have considered it a matter worth boasting of that he feels himself\u2014</p><p>'Stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over.'</p><p>As we do not wish, however, to press Mr. Whitman too hard upon this point, and seek to exhibit rather the philosophy of his teachings than his petits ridicules, we append in this same connection the following lyrical outburst of the true pantheistic spirit:</p><p>How beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is my soul!<br>How perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it!<br>What is called good is perfect, and what is called sin is just as<br>perfect.<br>The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and imponderable<br>fluids are perfect.<br>Oh, my soul! If I realize you I have satisfaction. Laws of the earth<br>and air! If I realize you I have satisfaction.<br>I swear I see now that every thing has a living soul!<br>The trees have, rooted in the ground; the weeds of the sea have;<br>the animals!</p><p>It is quite possible that, owing to some radical and congenital defect of our mental organization, we have never been able to penetrate 'within the veil' in the Pantheon of the transcendentalists and of the Emersonian school in general. Mr. Emerson, we understand, greatly admires the present work; indeed, we have read a published letter of his in which he tenders to Mr. Whitman his thanks for the Leaves of Grass. When we read that eulogy we were satisfied that this volume would prove to us a sealed book, and that its hieroglyphs would be as unintelligible to our ken as was the inscription around the sacred ibex to the erudite Mr. George Robins Gliddon.5 Still we determined to read it, in the humble but earnest hope of endeavoring occasionally to catch its esoteric meaning in a few at least of those passages, which we are assured from Mr. Emerson's enjoyment of them must contain a hidden significance which nothing less potent than the magic salve of the dervise of Balsora can open our eyes to behold; and in default of which we must be content with such a poor comprehension of these Sibylline leaves as falls to the lot of common readers.</p><p>No one, we may say, however, in all candor, can read this singular prose-poem without being struck by the writer's wonderful powers of description and of word-painting. His memory seems as retentive of its treasures as his imagination is opulent in its creations. He writes like one who has but to prick his mind and forthwith it gushes out in a perennial flow of 'thoughts which have tarried in its inner chambers.' It is only when we are balked in our attempt to trail his transcendental sinuosities of thought that we feel ourselves at fault, and then we are reminded of Longfellow's description of the Emersonian philosophy, which he likened to some of the roads in our great West, which at first open very fair and wide, and are shaded on both sides by the towering giants of the primeval forest, but which before long become narrower and narrower and at last dwindle to a squirrel path and run up a tree.</p>", "date": "February 18 1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Washington Daily National Intelligencer", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)].\" 18 February 1856.

Entered according to Act of Congress, by Walter Whitman, &c., &c., Brooklyn.</p><p>A new edition, we believe, of the famous Whitman's poems, which made such a flutter among the 'gray goose quills' of this city and 'other quarters of the globe' some time ago. Of the poem which occupies the ninety-five pages of this folio, we have before briefly spoken. Upon examining it a second time, and pondering its aims and expressions, we feel constrained to say that it is certainly the strangest, most extraordinary production we have ever attempted to peruse. Still, like the rest of our countrymen, we are by no means either averse to extraordinary things or afraid of them. We enjoy enterprise in speech and writing as thoroughly as in steam vessels, revolving rifles or new-found Nicaraguas. Therefore we shall not quarrel with Mr. Whitman for being odd. Oddness is the normal condition of some natures\u2014of the freshest and best, perhaps\u2014at least when it means frankness and opposition to solemn propriety, alias humbug and red tape.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's preface is what the hum-drum world calls 'queer' as entirely perhaps as his poem, yet we think a great deal of it both finely and bravely uttered as well as true. None can, more than we do, entirely hate that cant which always ascribes this or that kind of writing to this or the other 'school,' as if the young author had necessarily in every instance copied some model; as if two similarly constituted minds may not naturally seek similar expression! It is precisely this stupid, stereotyped classification adopted by indolent or clique-led reviewers, that has produced so many abortions in literature through the straining after at least the appearance of total originality, but to give future readers of this book some indication of its style, ere they have opened it, we will say that it is Germanic and Carlylean\u2014even Emersonian\u2014sometimes in the strain of Martin Farquhar Tupper,1 although far stronger and more pointed than the latter.</p><p>The poem exhibits undoubted and striking evidence of genius and power. But the author reasoning that the spirit of the American people, nay, of any people is chiefly represented by its uncultivated though, perhaps, naturally intelligent classes, falls into the error of mistaking their frequent uncouthness as a fair revelation of that spirit, and the bathos often produced in some of his finest passages by the presence of this idea defaces his work and repels hundreds of candid minds who would be eager to acknowledge his claims, but are thus prevented from reading enough to recognize them.</p><p>In glancing rapidly over the 'Leaves of Grass' you are puzzled whether to set the author down as a madman or an opium eater; when you have studied them you recognize a poet of extraordinary vigor, nay even beauty of thought, beneath the most fantastic possible garments of diction. If Hamlet had gone mad, in Ophelia's way, as well as in his own, and in addition to his own vein of madness, he might, when transported to our own age and country, have talked thus.</p><p>In a crush hat and red shirt open at the neck, without waistcoat or jacket, one hand on his hip and the other thrust into his pocket, Walt Whitman the b'hoy poet, on his muscle, writes sentences like these:</p><p>'A child said, What is grass?\u2014fetching it to me with<br>full hands.<br>How could I answer the child\u2026I do not know what it<br>is any more than he.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of<br>graves.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of<br>old mothers.<br>Darker than the colorless bears of old men,<br>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.<br>Oh I perceive, after all, so many uttering tongues!<br>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths<br>for nothing.[']</p><p>Again:</p><p>[']Press close, bare bosomed night!

It is of a genus so peculiar as to embarrass us, and has an air at once so novel, so audacious, and so strange as to verge upon absurdity, and yet it would be an injustice to pronounce it so, as the work is saved from this extreme by a certain mastery over diction not very easy of definition. What Emerson has pronounced to be good must not be lightly treated, and before we pronounce upon the merits of this performance it is but right to examine them. We have, then, a series of pithy prose sentences strung together\u2014forming twelve grand divisions in all, but which, having a rude rhythmical cadence about them admit of the designation poetical being applied. They are destitute of rhyme, measure of feet, and the like, every condition under which poetry is generally understood to exist being absent; but in their strength of expression, their fervor, hearty wholesomeness, their originality, mannerism, and freshness, one finds in them a singular harmony and flow, as if by reading, they gradually formed themselves into melody, and adopted characteristics peculiar and appropriate to themselves alone. If, however, some sentences be fine, there are others altogether laughable; nevertheless, in the bare strength, the unhesitating frankness of a man who 'believes in the flesh and the appetites,' and who dares to call simplest things by their plainest names, conveying also a large sense of the beautiful, and with an emphasis which gives a clearer conception of what manly modesty really is than any thing we have, in all conventional forms of word, deed, or act so far known of, that we rid ourselves, little by little, of the strangeness with which we greet this bluff new-comer, and, beginning to understand him better, appreciate him in proportion as he becomes more known.

I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p><p>R. W. EMERSON.</p><p>From the Brooklyn Daily Times we take a description of Mr. Walt Whitman, the author of Leaves of Grass:\u2014</p><p>He never offers others; what he continually offers is the man whom our Brooklynites know so well. Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from taint from top to toe, free for ever from headache and dyspepsia, full-blooded, six feet high, a good feeder, never once using medicine, drinking water only\u2014a swimmer in the river or bay or by the seashore\u2014of straight attitude and slow movement on foot\u2014an indescribable style evincing indifference and disdain\u2014ample limbed, weight a hundred and eighty-five pounds, age thirty-six years [1855]\u2014never dressed in black, always dressed freely and clean in strong clothes, neck open, shirt collar flat and broad, countenance of swarthy transparent red, beard short and well mottled with white, hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked\u2014face not refined or intellectual, but calm and wholesome\u2014a face of an unaffected animal\u2014a face that absorbs the sunshine and meets savage or gentleman on equal terms.</p><p>The American Phrenological Journal contrasts the poet of Leaves of Grass with Tennyson:\u2014</p><p>The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy, and their combination into love. This love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare the same as the rest. It is possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connexion with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female\u2026</p><p>Not a borrower from other lands, but a prodigal user of his own land is Walt Whitman. Not the refined life of the drawing-room\u2014not dancing, and polish, and gentility, but some powerful uneducated person, and some harsh identity of sound, and all wild free forms, are grateful to him. A thrill of his own likeness strikes him as the spotted hawk wheels noisily near his head at nightfall, and he is fain to say,\u2014</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed\u2014I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>The United States Review discovers in Mr. Whitman the founder of an indigenous school of American poetry:\u2014</p><p>Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all the attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature, talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such a being as a writer. Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior. Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of the old theories and forms. Every phrase announces new laws; not once do his lips unclose except in conformity with them. With light and rapid touch he first indicates in prose the principles of the foundation of a race of poets so deeply to spring from the American people, and become ingrained through them, that their Presidents shall not be the common referees so much as that great race of poets shall. He proceeds himself to exemplify this new school, and set models for their expression and range of subjects. He makes audacious and native use of his own body and soul. He must recreate poetry with the elements always at hand. He must inbue it with himself as he is, disorderly, fleshy, and sensual, a lover of things, yet a lover of men and women above the whole of the other objects of the universe. His work is to be achieved by unusual methods. Neither classic nor romantic is he, nor a materialist any more than a spiritualist. Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk and rhyme of poetry\u2014not the first recognition of gods or goddesses, or Greece or Rome. No breath of Europe, or her monarchies or priestly conventions, or her notions of gentlemen and ladies founded on the idea of caste, seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs. But in their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age, and the realities of this mighty continent, and the sciences, and inventions, and discoveries of the present world. Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor phrenology, nor engineering, is more true to itself than Walt Whitman is true to them. They and the other sciences underlie his whole superstructure. In the beauty of the work of the poet, he affirms, are the tuft and final applause of science.</p><p>Now for the pi\u00e8ces justifcatives. The exordium of Leaves of Grass is as follows:\u2014</p><p>I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>I loafe and invite my soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease\u2026observing a spear of summer grass.<br>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes\u2026the shelves are<br>crowded with perfumes,<br>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it,<br>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.<br>The atmosphere is not a perfume . . . . it has no taste of<br>the distillation\u2026<br>It is odorless,<br>It is for my mouth forever\u2026I am in love with it,<br>I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised<br>and naked,<br>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.</p><p>A little further on, the poet describes the subject of his poem, viz., himself:\u2014</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly fleshy and sensual\u2026eating drinking and breeding,<br>No sentimentalist\u2026no stander above men and woman or apart<br>from them\u2026no more modest than immodest.<br>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!<br>Whoever degrades another degrades me\u2026and whatever is<br>done or said returns at last to me,<br>And whatever I do or say I also return.</p><p>The title of the poem is explained at page 16:\u2014</p><p>A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with<br>full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?\u2026I do not know what it<br>is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of<br>hopeeful green stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we<br>may see and remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child\u2026the produced babe<br>of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I<br>receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>Mr. Whitman speculates on Humanity:\u2014</p><p>What is a man anyhow? What am I? and what are you?<br>All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but thread-<br>bare crape and tears.<br>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids\u2026conformity<br>goes to the fourth-removed,<br>I cock my hat as I please indoors or out.<br>hall I pray? Shall I venerate and be ceremonious?<br>I have pried through the strata and analysed to a hair,<br>And counselled with doctors and calculated close and found no sweeter fat<br>than sticks to my own bones.</p><p>Shortly afterwards the poet applies his theory of humanity to himself:\u2014</p><p>I know I am august,<br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologize<br>I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all.<br>I exist as I am, that is enough,<br>If no other in the world be aware I sit content.<br>And if each and all be aware I sit content.</p><p>Our last extract embodies Mr. Whitman's theological creed:\u2014</p><p>And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God,<br>For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,<br>No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about<br>death.<br>I hear and behold God in every object, yet I understand<br>God not in the least,<br>Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than<br>myself.<br>Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment<br>then,<br>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass;<br>I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by<br>God's name,<br>And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually<br>come for ever and ever.</p><p>After poetry like this, and criticism like this, it seems strange that we cannot recommend the book to our readers' perusal. But the truth is, that after every five or six pages of matter such as we have quoted, Mr. Whitman suddenly becomes exceedingly intelligible, but exceedingly obscene.

He is described by one of his own local papers as 'a tenderly affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral, susceptible, and imperious person,' who aspires to cast some of his own grit, whatever that may be, into literature. We have ourselves been disposed to think there is in literature grit enough, according to the ordinary sense, but decidedly Walt Whitman tosses in some more. The author describes himself as 'one of the roughs, a kosmos;' indeed, he seems to be very much impressed with the fact that he is a kosmos, and repeats it frequently. A kosmos we may define, from the portrait of it on the front of the book, as a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves, with one hand in a pocket of his pantaloons, and his wide-awake cocked with a dammee-sir air over his forehead.</p><p>On the other hand, according to an American review that flatters Mr Whitman, this kosmos is 'a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy.'</p><p>But as such terms of compliment may not be quite clear to English readers, we must be content, in simpler fashion, to describe to them this Brooklyn boy as a wild Tupper1 of the West.

Suppose that Mr Tupper had been brought up to the business of an auctioneer, then banished to the backwoods, compelled to live for a long time as a backwoodsman, and thus contracting a passion for the reading of Emerson and Carlyle? Suppose him maddened by this course of reading, and fancying himself not only an Emerson but a Carlyle and an American Shakespeare to boot when the fits come on, and putting forth his notion of that combination in his own self-satisfied way, and in his own wonderful cadences?

His verse has a purpose. He desires to assert the pleasure that a man has in himself, his body and its sympathies, his mind (in a lesser degree, however) and its sympathies. He asserts man's right to express his delight in animal enjoyment, and the harmony in which he should stand, body and soul, with fellow men and the whole universe. To express this, and to declare that the poet is the highest manifestation of this, generally also to suppress shams, is the purport of these Leaves of Grass. Perhaps it might have been done as well, however, without being always so purposely obscene, and intentionally foul-mouthed, as Mr Whitman is.</p><p>I think I could turn and live awhile with the animals . . . . they are so placid<br>and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br>No one is dissatisfied . . . . not one is demented with the mania of owning<br>things,<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br>Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.<br>So they show their relations to me and I accept them;<br>They bring me tokens of myself . . . . they evince them plainly in their posses-<br>sion.</p><p>The fit being very strong indeed upon him, our Wild Tupper of the West thus puts into words his pleasure at the hearing of an overture:</p><p>The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,<br>It wrenches unnamable ardors from my breast,<br>It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror,<br>It sails me . . . . I dab with bare feet . . . . they are licked by the indolent<br>waves,<br>I am exposed . . . . cut by bitter and poisoned hail,<br>Steeped amid honeyed morphine . . . . my windpipe squeezed in the fakes of<br>death,<br>Let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,<br>And that we call Being.<br>To be in any form, what is that?<br>If nothing lay more developed the quahaug and its callous shell were enough.<br>Mine is no callous shell,<br>I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,<br>They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.<br>I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,<br>To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.</p><p>In the construction of our artificial Whitman, we began with the requirement that a certain philosopher should have been bred to the business of an auctioneer. We must add now, to complete the imitation of Walt Whitman, that the wild philosopher and poet, as conceived by us, should be perpetually haunted by the delusion that he has a catalogue to make. Three-fourths of Walt Whitman's book is poetry as catalogues of auctioneers are poems. Whenever any general term is used, off the mind wanders on this fatal track, and an attempt is made to specify all lots included under it. Does Mr Whitman speak of a town, he is at once ready with pages of town lots. Does he mention the American country, he feels bound thereupon to draw up a list of barns, waggons, wilds, mountains, animals, trees, people, 'a Hoosier, a Badger, a Backeye, a Lousianian, or Georgian, a poke-easy from sandhills and pines,' etc., etc. We will give an illustration of this form of lunacy. The subject from which the patient starts off is equivalent to things in general, and we can spare room only for half the catalogue. It will be enough, however, to show how there arises catalogue within catalogue, and how sorely the paroxysm is aggravated by the incidental mention of any one particular that is itself again capable of subdivision into lots.</p><p>The usual routine . . . . the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk;<br>The jaunt of hunting or fishing, or the life of hunting or fishing,<br>Pasturelife, foddering, milking and herding, and all the personnel and usages;<br>The plum-orchard and apple-orchard . . . . gardening . . seedlings, cuttings,<br>flowers and vines,<br>Grains and manures . . marl, clay, loam . . the subsoil plough . . the shovel and<br>pick and rake and hoe . . irrigation and draining;<br>The currycomb . . the horse-cloth . . the halter and bridle and bits . . the very<br>wisps of straw,<br>The barn and barn-yard . . the bins and mangers . . the mows and racks:<br>Manufactures . . commerce . . engineering . . the building of cities, and every<br>trade carried on there . . and the implements of every trade,<br>The anvil and tongs and hammer . . the axe and wedge . . the square and mitre<br>and jointer and smoothingplane;<br>The plumbob and trowel and level . . the wall-scaffold, and the work of walls and<br>ceilings . . or any mason-work:<br>The ship's compass . . the sailor's tarpaulin . . the stays and lanyards, and the<br>ground-tackle for anchoring or mooring,<br>The sloop's tiller . . the pilot's wheel and bell . . the yacht or fish-smack . .<br>the great gay-pennanted three-hundred-foot steamboat under full head-<br>way, with her proud fat breasts and her delicate swift-flashing paddles;<br>The trail and line and hooks and sinkers . . the seine, and hauling the seine;<br>Smallarms and rifles . . . . the powder and shot and caps and wadding . . . . the<br>ordnance for war . . . . the carriages:<br>Everyday objects . . . . the housechairs, the carpet, the bed and the counterpane<br>of the bed, and him or her sleeping at night, and the wind blowing, and<br>the indefinite noises:<br>The snowstorm or rainstorm . . . . the tow-trowsers . . . . the lodge-hut in the<br>woods, and the still-hunt:<br>City and country . . fireplace and candle . . gaslight and heater and aqueduct;<br>The message of the governor, mayor, or chief of police . . . . the dishes of break-<br>fast or dinner or supper;<br>The bunkroom, the fire-engine, the string-team, and the car or truck behind;<br>The paper I write on or you write on . . and every word we write . . and every<br>cross and twirl of the pen . . and the curious way we write what we<br>think . . . . yet very faintly;<br>The directory, the detector, the ledger . . . . the books in ranks or the book-<br>shelves. . . . the clock attached to the wall,<br>The ring on your finger . . the lady's wristlet . . the hammers of stonebreakers or<br>coppersmiths . . the druggist's vials and jars;<br>The etui of surgical instruments, and the etui of oculist's or aurist's instruments,<br>or dentist's instruments;<br>Glassblowing, grinding of wheat and corn . . casting, and what is cast . . tin-<br>roofing, shingledressing,<br>Shipcarpentering, flagging of sidewalks by flaggers . . dockbuilding, fishcuring,<br>ferrying;<br>The pump, the piledriver, the great derrick . . the coalkiln and brickkiln,<br>Ironworks or whiteleadworks . . the sugarhouse . . steam-saws, and the great<br>mills and factories;<br>The cottonbale . . the stevedore's hook . . the saw and buck of the sawyer . .<br>the screen of the coalscreener . . the mould of the moulder . . the work-<br>ingknife of the butcher;<br>The cylinder press . . the handpress . . the frisket and tympan . . the composi-<br>tor's stick and rule,<br>The implements for daguerreotyping . . . . the tools of the rigger or grappler or<br>sailmaker or blockmaker,<br>Goods of guttapercha or papiermache . . . . colors and brushes . . . . glaziers'<br>implements.</p><p>Now let us compare with this a real auctioneer's catalogue. We will take that of Goldsmith's2 chambers, by way of departing as little as we can from the poetical. For, as Mr Whitman would say (and here we quote quite literally, prefixing only a verse of our own, from 'A Catalogue of the Household Furniture with the select collection of scarce, curious, and valuable books of Dr Goldsmith, deceased, which, by order of the admr, will be sold by auction, &c., &c.)\u2014</p><p>Surely the house of a poet is a poem, and behold a poet in the auctioneer who tells<br>you the whole lot of it,\u2014<br>The bath stone, compass front, open border, fender, shovel, tongs, and poker,<br>The blue moreen festoon window-curtain . . . the mahogany dining-table on the<br>floor,<br>The six ditto hollow seat chairs covered with blue moreen,<br>Covered with blue moreen and finished with a double row of brass nails and check<br>cases,<br>The Wilton carpet . . . sun shade, line and pulleys . . . the deal sideboard<br>stained,<br>* * * *<br>The teapot, five coffee cups, sugar basin and cover . . . four saucers and six cups,<br>Two quart decanters and stoppers . . . one plain ditto . . . eleven glasses, one<br>wine and water glass,<br>A pair of bellows and a brush . . . a footman, copper tea-kettle and coalscuttle.<br>Two pairs of plated candlesticks.<br> A mahogany teaboard, a pet bordered ditto . . . a large round japanned ditto and<br>two waiters.<br>The Tragic Muse in a gold frame.</p><p>After all, we are not sure whether the poetry of that excellent Mr Good, the auctioneer who, at his Great Room, No. 121 Fleet street, sold the household furniture of Oliver Goldsmith in the summer of 1774, does not transcend in wisdom and in wit 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that' (according to Mr Emerson) 'America has yet contributed.'</p>", "date": "March 22 1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Literary Examiner", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)].\" 22 March 1856.

Horsell.</p><p>WE had ceased, we imagined, to be surprised at anything that America could produce. We had become stoically indifferent to her Woolly Horses, her Mermaids, her Sea Serpents, her Barnums,1 and her Fanny Ferns;2 but the last monstrous importation from Brooklyn, New York, has scattered our indifference to the winds. Here is a thin quarto volume without an author's name on the title-page; but to atone for which we have a portrait engraved on steel of the notorious individual who is the poet presumptive. This portrait expresses all the features of the hard democrat, and none of the flexile delicacy of the civilised poet. The damaged hat, the rough beard, the naked throat, the shirt exposed to the waist, are each and all presented to show that the man to whom those articles belong scorns the delicate arts of civilisation. The man is the true impersonation of his book\u2014rough, uncouth, vulgar. It was by the merest accident that we discovered the name of this erratic and newest wonder; but at page 29 we find that he is\u2014</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual.</p><p>The words 'an American' are a surplusage, 'one of the roughs' too painfully apparent; but what is intended to be conveyed by 'a Kosmos' we cannot tell, unless it means a man who thinks that the fine essence of poetry consists in writing a book which an American reviewer is compelled to declare is 'not to be read aloud to a mixed audience.' We should have passed over this book, Leaves of Grass, with indignant contempt, had not some few Transatlantic critics attempted to 'fix' this Walt Whitman as the poet who shall give a new and independent literature to America\u2014who shall form a race of poets as Banquo's issue formed a line of kings. Is it possible that the most prudish nation in the world will adopt a poet whose indecencies stink in the nostrils? We hope not; and yet there is a probability, and we will show why, that this Walt Whitman will not meet with the stern rebuke which he so richly deserves. America has felt, oftener perhaps than we have declared, that she has no national poet\u2014that each one of her children of song has relied too much on European inspiration, and clung too fervently to the old conventionalities. It is therefore not unlikely that she may believe in the dawn of a thoroughly original literature, now there has arisen a man who scorns the Hellenic deities, who has no belief in, perhaps because he has no knowledge of, Homer and Shakspere; who relies on his own rugged nature, and trusts to his own rugged language, being himself what he shows in his poems. Once transfix him as the genesis of a new era, and the manner of the man may be forgiven or forgotten. But what claim has this Walt Whitman to be thus considered, or to be considered a poet at all? We grant freely enough that he has a strong relish for nature and freedom, just as an animal has; nay, further, that his crude mind is capable of appreciating some of nature's beauties; but it by no means follows that, because nature is excellent, therefore art is contemptible. Walt Whitman is, as unacquainted with art, as a hog is with mathematics. His poems\u2014we must call them so for convenience\u2014twelve in number, are innocent of rhythm, and resemble nothing so much as the war-cry of the Red Indians. Indeed, Walt Whitman has had near and ample opportunities of studying the vociferations of a few amiable savages. Or rather perhaps, this Walt Whitman reminds us of Caliban3 flinging down his logs, and setting himself to write a poem. In fact Caliban, and not Walt Whitman, might have written this:</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed\u2014I too am untranslatable.<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>Is this man with the 'barbaric yawp' to push Longfellow into the shade, and he meanwhile to stand and 'make mouths' at the sun? The chance of this might be formidable were it not ridiculous. That object or that act which most develops the ridiculous element carries in its bosom the seeds of decay, and is wholly powerless to trample out of God's universe one spark of the beautiful. We do not, then, fear this Walt Whitman, who gives us slang in the place of melody, and rowdyism in the place of regularity. The depth of his indecencies will be the grave of his fame, or ought to be if all proper feeling is not extinct. The very nature of this man's compositions excludes us from proving by extracts the truth of our remarks; but we, who are not prudish, emphatically declare that the man who wrote page 79 of the Leaves of Grass deserves nothing so richly as the public executioner's whip. Walt Whitman libels the highest type of humanity, and calls his free speech the true utterance of a man: we, who may have been misdirected by civilisation, call it the expression of a beast.</p><p>The leading idea of Walt Whitman's poems is as old as the hills. It is the doctrine of universal sympathy which the first poet maintained, and which the last on earth will maintain also. He says:</p><p>Not a mutineer walks handcuffed to the jail but I am hand-<br>cuffed to him and walk by his side,<br>Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the<br>last gasp.</p><p>To show this sympathy he instances a thousand paltry, frivolous, and obscene circumstances. Herein we may behold the difference between a great and a contemptible poet. What Shakspere\u2014mighty shade of the mightiest bard, forgive us the comparison \u2014expressed in a single line,</p><p>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</p><p>this Walt Whitman has tortured into scores of pages. A single extract will show what we mean.

Is it not more reasonable to suppose that Walt Whitman has been learning to write, and that the compositor has got hold of his copy-book? The American critics are, in the main, pleased with this man because he is self-reliant, and because he assumes all the attributes of his country. If Walt Whitman has really assumed those attributes, America should hasten to repudiate them, be they what they may. The critics are pleased also because he talks like a man unaware that there was ever such a production as a book, or ever such a being as a writer. This in the present day is a qualification exceedingly rare, and may be valuable, so we wish those gentlemen joy of their GREAT UNTAMED.</p><p>We must not neglect to quote an unusual passage, which may be suggestive to writers of the Old World. To silence our incredulous readers, we assure them that the passage may be found at page 92:\u2014</p><p>Is it wonderful that I should be immortal?<br>As every one is immortal, I know it is wonderful; but<br>my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how I was<br>conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful.<br>And how I was not palpable once but am now, and was born<br>on the last day of May 1819, and passed from a babe<br>in the creeping trance of three summers and three<br>winters to articulate and walk, are all equally wonderful.<br>And that I grew six feet high, and that I have become a<br>man thirty-six years old in 1855, and that I am here<br>anyhow,are all equally wonderful.</p><p>The transformation and the ethereal nature of Walt Whitman is marvellous to us, but perhaps not so to a nation from which the spirit-rappers sprung.</p><p>I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway<br>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags;<br>I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass love.<br>If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.</p><p>Here is also a sample of the man's slang and vulgarity:</p><p>This hour I tell things in confidence,<br>I might not tell everybody but I will tell you.<br>Who goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude?<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?<br>What is a man anyhow?

Emerson has praised it, and called it the 'most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.' Because Emerson has grasped substantial fame, he can afford to be generous; but Emerson's generosity must not be mistaken for justice. If this work is really a work of genius\u2014if the principles of those poems, their free language, their amazing and audacious egotism, their animal vigour, be real poetry and the divinest evidence of the true poet\u2014then our studies have been in vain, and vainer still the homage which we have paid the monarchs of Saxon intellect, Shakspere, and Milton, and Byron. This Walt Whitman holds that his claim to be a poet lies in his robust and rude health. He is, in fact, as he declares, 'the poet of the body.' Adopt this theory, and Walt Whitman is a Titan; Shelley and Keats the merest pigmies. If we had commenced a notice of Leaves of Grass in anger, we could not but dismiss it in grief, for its author, we have just discovered, is conscious of his affliction.

London: Horsell.)</p><p>\u2014'Latter-day poetry' in America is of a very different character from the same manifestation in the old country. Here, it is occupied for the most part with dreams of the middle ages, of the old knightly and religious times: in America, it is employed chiefly with the present, except when it travels out into the undiscovered future. Here, our latter-day poets are apt to whine over the times, as if Heaven were perpetually betraying the earth with a show of progress that is in fact retrogression, like the backward advance of crabs: there, the minstrels of the stars and stripes blow a loud note of exultation before the grand new epoch, and think the Greeks and Romans, the early Oriental races, and the later men of the middle centuries, of small account before the onward tramping of these present generations. Of this latter sect is a certain phenomenon who has recently started up in Brooklyn, New York\u2014one Walt Whitman, author of Leaves of Grass, who has been received by a section of his countrymen as a sort of prophet, and by Englishmen as a kind of fool. For ourselves, we are not disposed to accept him as the one, having less faith in latter-day prophets than in latter-day poets; but assuredly we cannot regard him as the other. Walt is one of the most amazing, one of the most startling, one of the most perplexing, creations of the modern American mind; but he is no fool, though abundantly eccentric, nor is his book mere food for laughter, though undoubtedly containing much that may most easily and fairly be turned into ridicule.</p><p>The singularity of the author's mind\u2014his utter disregard of ordinary forms and modes\u2014appears in the very title-page and frontispiece of his work. Not only is there no author's name (which in itself would not be singular), but there is no publisher's name\u2014that of the English bookseller being a London addition. Fronting the title is the portrait of a bearded gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and a Spanish hat, with an all-pervading atmosphere of Yankee-doodle about him; but again there is no patronymic, and we can only infer that this roystering blade is the author of the book. Then follows a long prose treatise by way of Preface (and here once more the anonymous system is carried out, the treatise having no heading whatever); and after that we have the poem, in the course of which, a short autobiographical discourse reveals to us the name of the author.</p><p>A passage from the Preface, if it may be so called, will give some insight into the character and objects of the work. The dots do not indicate any abbreviation by us, but are part of the author's singular system of punctuation:\u2014</p><p><em>Other states indicate themselves in their deputies\u2026but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors\u2026but always most in the common people. Their manners speech dress friendships\u2014the freshness and candour of their physiognomy\u2014the picturesque looseness of their carriage\u2026their deathless attachment to freedom\u2014their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft, or mean\u2014the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states\u2014the fierceness of their roused resentment\u2014their curiosity and welcome of novelty\u2014their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy\u2014their susceptibility to a slight\u2014the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors\u2014the fluency of their speech\u2014their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul\u2026their good temper and open-handedness\u2014the terrible significance of their elections\u2014the President's taking off his hat to them not they to him\u2014these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</em></p><p>This 'gigantic and generous treatment,' we presume, is offered in the pages which ensue. The poem is written in wild, irregular, unrhymed, almost unmetrical 'lengths,' like the measured prose of Mr. Martin Farquhar Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, or of some of the Oriental writings. The external form, therefore, is startling, and by no means seductive, to English ears, accustomed to the sumptuous music of ordinary metres; and the central principle of the poem is equally staggering. It seems to resolve itself into an all-attracting egotism\u2014an eternal presence of the individual soul of Walt Whitman in all things, yet in such wise that this one soul shall be presented as a type of all human souls whatsoever. He goes forth into the world, this rough, devil-may-care Yankee; passionately identifies himself with all forms of being, sentient or inanimate; sympathizes deeply with humanity; riots with a kind of Bacchanal fury in the force and fervour of his own sensations; will not have the most vicious or abandoned shut out from final comfort and reconciliation; is delighted with Broadway, New York, and equally in love with the desolate backwoods, and the long stretch of the uninhabited prairie, where the wild beasts wallow in the reeds, and the wilder birds start upwards from their nests among the grass; perceives a divine mystery wherever his feet conduct or his thoughts transport him; and beholds all beings tending towards the central and sovereign Me. Such, as we conceive, is the key to this strange, grotesque, and bewildering book; yet we are far from saying that the key will unlock all the quirks and oddities of the volume. Much remains of which we confess we can make nothing; much that seems to us purely fantastical and preposterous; much that appears to our muddy vision gratuitously prosaic, needlessly plain-speaking, disgusting without purpose, and singular without result. There are so many evidences of a noble soul in Whitman's pages that we regret these aberrations, which only have the effect of discrediting what is genuine by the show of something false; and especially do we deplore the unnecessary openness with which Walt reveals to us matters which ought rather to remain in a sacred silence. It is good not to be ashamed of Nature; it is good to have an all-inclusive charity; but it is also good, sometimes, to leave the veil across the Temple.</p><p>That the reader may be made acquainted with the vividness with which Walt can paint the unhackneyed scenery of his native land, we subjoin a panorama:\u2014</p><p>By the city's quadrangular houses . . . in log-huts, or camping with lumber-men,<br>Along the ruts of the turnpike . . . along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,<br>Hoeing my onion-patch, and rows of carrots and parsnips . . . crossing savannas . . <br>trailing in forests,<br>Prospecting . . . gold-digging . . . girdling the trees of a new purchase,<br>Scorched ankle-deep by the hot sand . . . hauling my boat down the shallow river;<br>Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead . . . where the buck turns <br>furiously at the hunter,<br>Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock . . . where the otter is feed-<br>ing on fish,<br>Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,<br>Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey . . . where the beaver pats the <br>mud with his paddle-tail;<br>Over the growing sugar . . . over the cotton plant . . . over the rice in its low, <br>moist field;<br>Over the sharp-peaked farmhouse with its scalloped scum and slender shoots from the <br>gutters;<br>Over the western persimmon . . . over the long-leaved corn and the delicate blue<br> flowered flax;<br>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and a buzzer there with the rest,<br>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;<br>Scaling mountains . . . pulling myself cautiously up . . . holding on by low <br>scragged limbs,<br>Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush;<br>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot,<br>Where the bat flies in the July eve . . . where the great goldbug drops through the <br>dark;<br>Where the flails keep time on the barn floor,<br>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,<br>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,<br>Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, and andirons straddle the hearth-slab, <br>and cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;<br>Where triphammers crash . . . where the press is whirling its cylinders;<br>Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes out of its ribs.</p>", "date": "June 7 1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "George Eliot", "publication": "none", "citation": "Eliot, George [unsigned in original]. \"Transatlantic Latter-Day Poetry.\" 7 June 1856.

Edinburgh and London, 1856.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, New York, 1855.</p><p>In the works named above we have two not unmete representatives of the extremes of the Old and of the New World poetic ideal: 'Bothwell,' the product of the severely critical, refined, and ultra-conservative author of the Lays of the 'Scottish Cavaliers;' and 'Leaves of Grass,' the wild, exuberant, lawless offspring of Walt Whitman, a Brooklyn Boy, 'One of the Roughs!'</p><p>In contrast with this we have named the effusions of the Brooklyn Bard. If the accredited author of 'Firmilian' has now shown us what a poem ought to be, assuredly Walt Whitman is wide of the mark. Externally and internally he sets all law, decorum, prosody and propriety at defiance. A tall, lean, sallow, most republican, and Yankee-looking volume, is his 'Leaves of grass; full of egotism, extravagance, and spasmodic eccentricities of all sorts; and heralded by a sheaf of double-columned extracts from Reviews\u2014not always the least curious of its singular contents. Here, for example, is a protest against the intrusion of the British muse on the free soil of the States of the Union, which must surely satisfy the most clamant demand for native poetics and republican egotism:</p><p>'What very properly fits a subject of the British crown, may fit very ill an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect, is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; everything receives its tinge from that. In the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakespeare, just as much as the rest, there is the air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakespeare represented in America, is not an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone\u2014never silent in their plots and characters\u2014be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson was the most enormous of liars, and common persons, North and South, should bow low to their betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops.'</p><p>\u2014and here accordingly is something essentially different from all poets, both old and new.</p><p>The poet, unnamed on his title page, figures on his frontispiece, and unmistakeably utters his own poem:</p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume, you shall assume;<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>I loafe, and invite my soul;<br>I lean and loafe at my ease\u2014<br>Observing a spear of Summer grass.'</p><p>Such is the starting point of this most eccentric and republican of poets; of whom the republican critic above quoted, after contrasting with him Tennyson, as 'The bard of ennui, and the aristocracy and their combination into love, the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare, the same as the rest.'\u2014concludes by confessing his inability to decide whether Walt Whitman is 'to prove the most lamentable of failures, or the most glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature.'</p><p>Assuredly, the Brooklyn poet is no commonplace writer. That he is startling and outr\u00e9, no one who opens his volume will doubt. The conventionalities, and proprieties, and modesties, of thought, as well as of language, hold him in no restraint; and hence he has a vantage ground from which he may claim such credit as its licence deserves. But, apart from this, there are unmistakeable freshness, originality, and true poetic gleams of thought, mingled with the strange incoherencies of his boastful rhapsody. To call his 'Leaves' poems, would be a mistake; they resemble rather the poet's first jottings, out of which the poem is to be formed; the ore out of which the metal is to be smelted; and, in its present form, with more of dross than sterling metal in the mass.</p><p>To find an extractable passage is no easy task. Here a fine suggestive fancy ends in some offensive pruriency; there it dwindles into incomprehensible aggregations of words and terms, which\u2014unless Machiavelli was right in teaching that words were given us to conceal our thoughts,\u2014are mere clotted nonsense! Were we disposed to ridicule: our selections would be easy enough; or gravely to censure: abundant justification is at hand. We rather cull\u2014not without needful omissions\u2014the thoughts that seem to have suggested the quaint title of 'Leaves of Grass'.</p><p>'Loafe with me on the grass\u2026loose the stop from your throat,<br>Not words, not music or rhyme I want: not custom or lecture, not even the best,<br>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>I know that the hand of God is the elderhand of my own,<br>And I know that the spirit of God is the eldest brother of my own,<br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers\u2026and the women <br>my sisters and lovers,<br>And that a kelson of the Creation is love;<br>And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields.<br>A child said, what is the Grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?\u2026I do not know what it is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green <br>stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name some way in the corners, that we may see and <br>remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child\u2026the produced babe of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, Sprouting, alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressmen, Cuff,<br>I give them the same, I receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>All truths wait in all things,<br>They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,<br>They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,<br>The insignificant is as big to me as any,<br>Logic and sermons never convince,<br>The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars,<br>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of <br>the wren,<br>And the tree-toad is a chef-d' uvre for the highest,<br>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,<br>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,<br>And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses any statue,<br>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.'</p><p>This passage is far from being the most characteristic of the poem, and even in it we have stopped abruptly for one line more, and\u2026Yet this will show that the punctuation is as odd as any other feature of the work; for the whole is full of conceits which speak fully as much of coarse vain-glorious egotism as of originality of genius. Any man may be an original, whether in the fopperies of the dress he puts on himself or on his poem. We are not, therefore, disposed to rate such very high, or to reckon Walt Whitman's typographical whims any more indicative of special genius, than the shirt-sleeves and unshaven chin of his frontispiece. If they indicate any thing specially, we should infer that he is a compositor by trade, and, for all his affectations of independence, could not keep 'the shop' out of his verse. But that he sets all the ordinary rules of men and poets at defiance is visible on every page of his lank volume; and if readers judge thereby that he thinks himself wiser than all previous men and poets\u2014we have no authority to contradict them.

Here again is a grand idea, not altogether new; and rough in its present setting, as the native gold still buried in Californian beds of quartz and debris. Nevertheless it is full of suggestive thought, and like much else in the volume\u2014though less than most,\u2014only requires the hand of the artist to cut, and polish, and set, that it may gleam and sparkle with true poetic lustre:\u2014</p><p>'A slave at auction!<br>I help the auctioneer\u2026the sloven does not half know his business.<br>Gentlemen look on this curious creature,<br>Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for him,<br>For him the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or <br>plant,<br>For him the revolving cycles truly and steadily rolled.<br>In that head the allbaffling brain,<br>In it and below it the making of the attributes of heroes.<br>Examine these limbs, red, black or white\u2026they are very cunning in tendon <br>and nerve;<br>They shall be stript that you may see them.<br>Exquisite senses, lifelit eyes, pluck, volition,<br>Flakes of breastmuscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good <br>sized arms and legs,<br>And wonders within there yet.<br>Within there runs his blood\u2026the same old blood\u2026the <br>same red running blood<br>There swells and jets his heart\u2026There all passions and desires\u2026all <br>reachings and aspirations:<br>Do you think they are not there because they are not expressed in parlors <br>and lecture-rooms?<br>This is not only one man\u2026he is the father of those who shall be fathers in <br>their turns,<br>In him the start of populous states and rich republics,<br>Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.<br>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through <br>the centuries?<br>Who might you find you have come from yourself?'</p><p>'Great is life\u2026and real and mystical\u2026wherever and whoever,<br>Great is death\u2026sure as life holds all parts together, death holds all parts <br>together;<br>Sure as the stars return again after they merge in the light, death is greater <br>than life.'</p><p>Such are some of the 'Leaves of Grass,' of the Brooklyn poet who describes himself in one of them as:</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos!'</p><p>But if the reader\u2014recognising true poetry in some of these,\u2014should assume such a likeness running through the whole as pertains to the blades of Nature's Grass, we disclaim all responsibility if he find reason to revise his fancy. In the two very diverse volumes under review it seems to us that we have in the one the polish of the artist, which can accomplish so much when applied to the gem or rich ore; in the other we discern the ore, but overlaid with the valueless matrix and foul rubbish of the mine, and devoid of all the unveiling beauties of art. Viewed in such aspects these poems are characteristic of the age. From each we have striven to select what appeared most worthy of the space at command, and best calculated to present them to the reader in the most favorable point of view consistent with truth. And so we leave the reader to his own judgment, between the old-world stickler for authority, precedent, and poetical respectability, and the new-world contemner of all authorities, laws, and respectabilities whatsoever. Happily for us, all choice is not necessarily limited to these. The golden mean of poesie does not, we imagine, lie between such extremes. There are not a few left, both in England and in America, for whom old Shakspeare is still respectable enough, and poetical enough,\u2014aye and free enough too, in spite of all the freedom which has budded and bloomed since that year 1616, when his sacred ashes were laid beneath the chancel stone whose curse still guards them from impious hands. Nevertheless we have faith in the future. We doubt not even the present.

Affectation is as pitiful an ambition in literature as alliteration, and never has it been more fully exhibited during the present century than in the case of Thomas Carlyle, a man with an order of intellect approaching genius, but who for a distinguishing mark to point like a finger-board to himself, left a very terse and effective style of writing to adopt a jargon filled with new-fangled phrases and ungrammatical super-superlative adjectives\u2014Mr. Carlyle buried himself for a long time in German universities and German philosophy, and came forth clothed in a full 'old clothes' suit of transcendentalism worthy of the Chatham street embodiments of that pseudo-philosophy, Kant and Spinosa [sic]\u2014Carlyle by this operation became a full-fledged Psyche from the chrysalis, and sported in the sunshine of popularity, whereupon a young gentleman ambitious of making New England an umbra of Scottish-Germanic glory, one Ralph Waldo Emerson, suddenly transforms himself into a metaphysical transcendentalist and begins talking about 'Objective and Subjective,' the 'Inner and Outer,' the 'Real and Ideal,' the 'God-heads and God-tails,' 'Planes,' 'Spheres,' 'Finite, Infinite,' 'Unities,' and 'Dualities,' 'Squills, Ipecac,' 'Cascading and Cavorting,' &, & And lo! another appeared after this Mr. Emerson, one Walt Whitman, who kicked over the whole bucket of the Milky Way, and deluged the world with the whey, curds and bonny-clabber of Brooklyn\u2014which has resulted from the turning of the milk of human kindness in a 'b'hoy's' brains to the cream of Tartar\u2014and a delicious dish of the same is now furnished under cover of Leaves of Grass, and indorsed by the said Emerson, who swallows down Whitman's vulgarity and beastliness as if they were curds and whey.

We hoped that they had dropped, and we should hear no more of them. But since they thrust themselves upon us again, with a pertinacity that is proverbial of noxious weeds, and since these thirty- two poems (!) threaten to become 'several hundred,\u2014perhaps a thousand,'\u2014we can no longer refrain from speaking of them as we think they deserve. For here is not a question of literary opinion principally, but of the very essence of religion and morality. The book might pass for merely hectoring and ludicrous, if it were not something a great deal more offensive. We are bound in conscience to call it impious and obscene. Punch 1 made sarcastic allusion to it some time ago, as a specimen of American literature. We regard it as one of its worst disgraces. Whether or not the author really bears the name he assumes,\u2014whether or not the strange figure opposite the title-page resembles him, or is even intended for his likeness\u2014whether or not he is considered among his friends to be of a sane mind,\u2014whether he is in earnest, or only playing off some disgusting burlesque,\u2014we are hardly sure yet. We know only, that, in point of style, the book is an impertinence towards the English language; and in point of sentiment, an affront upon the recognized morality of respectable people. Both its language and thought seem to have just broken out of Bedlam. It sets off upon a sort of distracted philosophy, and openly deifies the bodily organs, senses, and appetites, in terms that admit of no double sense. To its pantheism and libidinousness it adds the most ridiculous swell of self-applause; for the author is 'one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, divine inside and out. This head more than churches or bibles or creeds. The scent of these arm-pits an aroma finer than prayer. If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some of the spread of my body.' He leaves 'washes and razors for foofoos;' thinks the talk 'about virtue and about vice' only 'blurt,' he being above and indifferent to both of them; and he himself, 'speaking the pass-word primeval, By God! will accept nothing which all cannot have the counterpart of on the same terms.' These quotations are made with cautious delicacy. We pick our way as cleanly as we can between other passages which are more detestable.</p><p>A friend whispers as we write, that there is nevertheless a vein of benevolence running through all this vagabondism and riot. Yes; there is plenty of that philanthropy, which cares as little for social rights as for the laws of God. This Titan in his own esteem is perfectly willing that all the rest of the world should be as frantic as himself. In fact, he has no objection to any persons whatever, unless they wear good clothes, or keep themselves tidy. Perhaps it is not judicious to call any attention to such a prodigious impudence. Dante's guide through the infernal regions bade him, on one occasion, Look and pass on. It would be a still better direction sometimes, when in neighborhoods of defilement and death, to pass on without looking. Indeed, we should even now hardly be tempted to make the slightest allusion to this crazy outbreak of conceit and vulgarity, if a sister Review had not praised it, and even undertaken to set up a plea in apology for its indecencies. We must be allowed to say, that it is not good to confound the blots upon great compositions with the compositions that are nothing but a blot. It is not good to confound the occasional ebullitions of too loose a fancy or too wanton a wit, with a profession and 'illustrated' doctrine of licentiousness. And furthermore, it is specially desirable to be able to discern the difference between the nudity of a statue and the gestures of a satyr; between the plain language of a simple state of society, and the lewd talk of the opposite state, which a worse than heathen lawlessness has corrupted; between the '\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9,' or '\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03b3\u03b7 \u03bd\u03b1\u03b9' of the Iliad and Odyssey, and an ithyphallic audacity that insults what is most sacred and decent among men.</p><p>There is one feature connected with the second edition of this foul work to which we cannot feel that we do otherwise than right in making a marked reference, because it involves the grossest violation of literary comity and courtesy that ever passed under our notice. Mr. Emerson had written a letter of greeting to the author on the perusal of the first edition, the warmth and eulogium of which amaze us. But 'Walt Whitman' has taken the most emphatic sentence of praise from this letter, and had it stamped in gold, signed 'R. W. Emerson,' upon the back of his second edition. This second edition contains some additional pieces, which in their loathsomeness exceed any of the contents of the first. Thus the honored name of Emerson, which has never before been associated with anything save refinement and delicacy in speech and writing, is made to indorse a work that teems with abominations.</p>", "date": "November 1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "William Rounseville Alger", "publication": "The Christian Examiner", "citation": "Alger, William Rounseville [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1856)].\" November 1856.

What conglomerate of thought is this before us, with insolence, philosophy, tenderness, blasphemy, beauty and gross indecency tumbling in drunken confusion through the pages? Who is this arrogant young man who proclaims himself the Poet of the Time, and who roots like a pig among a rotten garbage of licentious thoughts? Who is this flushed and full-blooded lover of Nature who studies her so affectionately, and who sometimes utters her teachings with a lofty tongue? This mass of extraordinary contradictions, this fool and this wise man, this lover of beauty and this sunken sensualist, this original thinker and blind egotist, is Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, author of Leaves of Grass, and, according to his own account, 'a Kosmos.'</p><p>Some time since there was left at the office of this paper a thin quarto volume bound in green and gold. On opening the book we first beheld, as a frontispiece, the picture of a man in his shirt sleeves, wearing an expression of settled arrogance upon his countenance. We next arrived at a title page of magnificent proportions, with letter-press at least an inch and a half in length. From this title page we learned that the book was entitled Leaves of Grass, and was printed at Brooklyn in the year 1855. This inspected, we passed on to what seemed to be a sort of preface, only that it had no beginning, was remarkable for a singular sparseness in the punctuation, and was broken up in a confusing manner by frequent rows of dots separating the paragraphs. To this succeeded eighty-two pages of what appeared at the first glance to be a number of prose sentences printed somewhat after a biblical fashion. Almost at the first page we opened we lighted upon the confession that the author was</p><p>'WALT. WHITMAN, an American, one of the roughs, <br>a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy and sensual . . . . '</p><p>This was sufficient basis for a theory. We accordingly arrived at the conclusion that the insolent-looking young man on the frontispiece was this same WALT. WHITMAN, and author of the Leaves of Grass.</p><p>Then returning to the fore-part of the book, we found proof slips of certain review articles about the Leaves of Grass. One of these purported to be extracted from a periodical entitled the United States Review, the other was headed 'From the American Phrenological Journal.' These were accompanied by a printed copy of an extravagant letter of praise addressed by Mr. RALPH WALDO EMERSON to Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, complimenting him on the benefaction conferred on society in the present volume. On subsequently comparing the critiques from the United States Review and the Phrenological Journal with the preface of the Leaves of Grass, we discovered unmistakable internal evidence that Mr. Walt Whitman, true to his character, of a Kosmos, was not content with writing a book, but was also determined to review it; so Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, had concocted both those criticisms of his own work, treating it we need not say how favorably. This little discovery of our 'disorderly' acquaintance's mode of proceeding rather damped any enthusiasm with which Mr. EMERSON's exravagant letter may have inspired us. We reflected, here is a man who sets himself up as the poet and teacher of his time; who professes a scorn of everything mean and dastardly and double-faced, who hisses with scorn as he passes one in the street whom he suspects of the taint, hypocrisy - yet this self-contained teacher, this rough-and-ready scorner of dishonesty, this rowdy knight-errant who tilts against all lies and shams, himself perpetrates a lie and a sham at the very outset of his career. It is a lie to write a review of one's own book, then extract it from the work in which it appeared and send it out to the world as an impartial editorial utterance. It is an act that the most degraded helot of literature might blush to commit. It is a dishonesty committed against one's own nature, and all the world. Mr. WALT. WHITMAN in one of his candid rhapsodies announces that he is 'no more modest than immodest.' Perhaps in literary matters he carries the theory farther, and is no more honest than dishonest. He likewise says in his preface: 'The great poets are known by the absence in them of tricks, and by the justification of perfect personal candor.' Where, then, can we place Mr. WALT. WHITMAN's claims upon immortality?</p><p>We confess we turn from Mr. WHITMAN as Critic, to Mr. WHITMAN as Poet, with considerable pleasure. We prefer occupying that independent position which Mr. WHITMAN claims for man, and forming our own opinions, rather than swallowing those ready-made. This gentleman begins his poetic life with a coarse and bitter scorn of the past. We have been living stale and unprofitable lives; we have been surfeited with luxury and high living, and are grown lethargic and dull; the age is fast decaying, when, lo! the trump of the Angel Whitman brings the dead to life, and animates the slumbering world. If we obey the dictates of that trumpet, we will do many strange things. We will fling off all moral clothing and walk naked over the earth. We will disembarrass our language of all the proprieties of speech, and talk indecency broadcast. We will act in short as if the Millennium were arrived in this our present day, when the absence of all vice would no longer necessitate a virtuous discretion. We fear much, Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, that the time is not yet come for the nakedness of purity. We are not yet virtuous enough to be able to read your poetry aloud to our children and our wives. What might be pastoral simplicity five hundred years hence, would perhaps be stigmatized as the coarsest indecency now, and - we regret to think that you have spoken too soon.</p><p>The adoration of the 'Me,' the 'Ego,' the 'eternal and universal I,' to use the jargon of the Boston Oracle, is the prevailing motive of Leaves of Grass. Man embraces and comprehends the whole. He is everything, and everything is him. All nature ebbs and flows through him in ceaseless tides. He is 'his own God and his own Devil,' and everything that he does is good. He rejoices with all who rejoice; suffers with all who suffer. This doctrine is exemplified in the book by a panorama as it were of pictures, each of which is shared in by the author, who belongs to the universe, as the universe belongs to him. In detailing these pictures he hangs here and there shreds and tassels of his wild philosophy, till his work, like a maniac's robe, is bedizened with fluttering tags of a thousand colors. With all his follies, insolence, and indecency, no modern poet that we know of has presented finer descriptive passages than Mr. WALT. WHITMAN. His phrasing, and the strength and completeness of his epithets, are truly wonderful. He paints in a single line with marvellous power and comprehensiveness. The following rhapsody will illustrate his fulness of epithet:</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing <br>night;<br>I call to the earth and sea, half held by the night.</p><p>'Press close bare-bosomed night! Press close mag-<br>netic, nourishing night!<br>Night of South winds! Night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night! Mad, naked, Summer night!</p><p>'Smile, O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains <br>misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue! <br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the <br>river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbowed earth! Rich apple-blossomed <br>earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes!</p><p>'You sea! I resign myself to you also\u2026I guess <br>what you mean.<br>I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fin-<br> gers,<br>I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;<br>We must have a turn together\u2026I undress\u2026hurry <br>me out of sight of the land.<br>Cushion me soft\u2026rock me in billowy drowse,<br>Dash me with amorous wet\u2026I can repay you.'</p><p>'Sea of stretched ground-swells!<br>Sea, breathing broad and convulsive breaths!<br>Sea of the brine of life! Sea of unshovelled and al- <br>ways-ready graves!<br>Howler and scooper of storms! Capricious and dainty <br>sea!<br>I am integral with you\u2026I too am of one phase and <br>of all phases.'</p><p>Here are fine expressions well placed. Mr. WHITMAN's study of nature has been close and intense. He has expressed certain things better than any other man who has gone before him. He talks well, and largely, and tenderly of sea and sky, and men and trees, and women and children. His observation and his imagination are both large and well-developed. Take this picture; how pathetic, how tenderly touched!</p><p>'Agonies are one of my changes of garments;<br>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels\u2026I <br>myself become the wounded person,<br>My hurt turns livid upon me as I lean on a cane and <br>observe.<br>I am the mashed fireman with breast-bone broken\u2026 <br>trembling walls buried me in their debris.<br>Heat and smoke I inspired\u2026I heard the yelling <br>shouts of my comrades,<br>I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;<br>They have cleared the beams away\u2026they tenderly <br>lift me forth.<br>I lie in the night air in my red shirt\u2026the pervading <br>hush is for my sake,<br>Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy.<br>White and beautiful are the faces around me\u2026the <br>heads are bared of their fire-caps.<br>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the <br>torches.'</p><p>If it were permitted to us to outrage all precedent, and print that which should not be printed, we could cull some passages from the 'Leaves of Grass,' and place them in strange contrast with the extracts we have already made. If being a Kosmos is to set no limits to one's imagination; to use coarse epithets when coarseness is not needful; to roam like a drunken satyr, with inflamed blood, through every field of lascivious thought; to return time after time with a seemingly exhaustless prurient pleasure to the same licentious phrases and ideas, and to jumble all this up with bits of marvellously beautiful description, exquisite touches of nature, fragments of savagely uttered truth, shreds of unleavened philosophy; if to do all this is to be a Kosmos, then indeed we cede to Mr. WALT. WHITMAN his arrogated title. Yet it seems to us that one may be profound without being beastly; one may teach philosophy without clothing it in slang; one may be a great poet without using a language which shall outlaw the minstrel from every decent hearth. Mr. WALT. WHITMAN does not think so. He tears the veil from all that society by a well-ordered law shrouds in a decent mystery. He is proud of his nakedness of speech; he glories in his savage scorn of decorum. Like the priests of Belus, he wreathes around his brow the emblems of the Phallic worship.</p><p>With all this muck of abomination soiling the pages, there is a wondrous, unaccountable fascination about the Leaves of Grass. As we read it again and again, and we will confess that we have returned to it often, a singular order seems to arise out of its chaotic verses. Out of the mire and slough edged thoughts and keen philosophy start suddenly, as the men of Cadmus sprang from the muddy loam. A lofty purpose still dominates the uncleanness and the ridiculous self-conceit in which the author, led astray by ignorance, indulges. He gives token everywhere that he is a huge uncultivated thinker. No country save this could have given birth to the man. His mind is Western\u2014brawny, rough, and original. Wholly uncultivated, and beyond his associates, he has begotten within him the egotism of intellectual solitude. Had he mingled with scholars and men of intellect, those effete beings whom he so despises, he would have learned much that would have been beneficial. When we have none of our own size to measure ourselves with, we are apt to fancy ourselves broader and taller and stronger than we are. The poet of the little country town, who has reigned for years the Virgil or Anacreon1 of fifty square miles, finds, when he comes into the great metropolis, that he has not had all the thinking to himself. There he finds hundreds of men who have thought the same things as himself, and uttered them more fully. He is astonished to discover that his intellectual language is limited, when he thought that he had fathomed expression. He finds his verse unpolished, his structure defective, his best thoughts said before. He enters into the strife, clashes with his fellows, measures swords with this one, gives thrust for thrust with the other, until his muscles harden and his frame swells. He looks back upon his provincial intellectual existence with a smile; he laughs at his country arrogance and ignorant faith in himself. Now we gather from Mr. WHITMAN's own admissions\u2014admissions that assume the form of boasts\u2014that he has mingled but little with intellectual men. The love of the physical\u2014which is the key-note of his entire book\u2014has as yet altogether satisfied him. To mix with large-limbed, clean-skinned men, to look on ruddy, fair-proportioned women, is his highest social gratification. This love of the beautiful is by him largely and superbly expressed in many places, and it does one good to read those passages pulsating with the pure blood of animal life. But those associates, though manly and handsome, help but little to a man's inner appreciation of himself. Perhaps our author among his comrades had no equal in intellectual force. He reigned triumphantly in an unquestioning circle of admirers. How easy, then, to fancy one's self a wonderful being! How easy to look around and say, 'There are none like me here. I am the coming man!' It may be said that books will teach such a man the existence of other powerful minds, but this will not do. Such communion is abstract, and has but little force. It is only in the actual combat of mind striving with mind that a man comes properly to estimate himself. Mr. WHITMAN has grown up in an intellectual isolation which has fully developed all the eccentricities of his nature. He has made some foolish theory that to be rough is to be original. Now, external softness of manner is in no degree incompatible with muscularity of intellect; and one thinks no more of a man's brains for his treading on one's toes without an apology, or his swearing in the presence of women. When Mr. WHITMAN shall have learned that a proper worship of the individual man need not be expressed so as to seem insolence, and that men are not to be bullied into receiving as a Messiah every man who sneers at them in his portrait, and disgusts them in his writings, we have no doubt that in some chastened mood of mind he will produce moving and powerful books. We select some passages exhibiting the different phases of Mr. WHITMAN's character. We do so more readily as, from the many indecencies contained in Leaves of Grass, we do not believe it will find its way into many families.</p><p><em>A MODEST PROFESSION OF FAITH.</em></p><p>'Nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,<br>And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy, <br>walks to his own funeral,<br>Dressed in his shroud.'</p><p><em>A FINE LANDSCAPE.</em></p><p>'The turbid pool that lies in the Autumn forest,<br>The moon that descends the steeps of the soughing <br>twilight,<br>Toss, sparkles of day and dusk\u2026toss on the black <br>stems that decay in the muck;<br>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.'</p><p><em>A TRUTH.</em></p><p>'I, too, am not a bit tamed\u2026I, too, am untransla- <br>table;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p><em>A DEATH-BED.</em></p><p>'When the dull nights are over, and the dull days <br>also;<br>When the soreness of lying so much in bed is over,<br>When the physician, after long putting off, gives the <br>silent and terrible look for an answer;<br>When the children come hurried and weeping, and the <br>brothers and sisters have been sent for;<br>When medicines stand unused on the shelf, and the <br>camphor-smell has pervaded the rooms;<br>When the faithful hand of the living does not desert <br>the hand of the dying,<br>When the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead <br>of the dying;<br>When the breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart <br>ceases;<br>Then the corpse limbs stretch on the bed, and the <br>living look upon them,<br>They are palpable as the living are palpable.<br>The living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,<br>But without eye-sight lingers a different living and looks <br>curiously on the corpse.'</p><p><em>IMMORTALITY.</em><p><p>'If maggots and rats ended us, then suspicion, and <br>treachery and death.<br>Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death I <br>should die now.<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited <br>towards annihilation?'</p><p><em>THE REVOLUTION OF 1848.</em></p><p>'Yet behind all, lo, a shape,<br>Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front <br>and form in scarlet folds,<br>Whose face and eyes none may see,<br>Out of its robes only this\u2026the red robes, lifted by <br>the arm,<br>One finger pointed high over the top, like the head of <br>a snake appears.<br>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves\u2026bloody <br>corpses of young men:<br>The rope of the gibbet, hangs heavily\u2026the bullets <br>of princes are flying\u2026the creatures of power <br>laugh aloud.</p><p>And all these things bear fruits\u2026and they are good.<br>Those corpses of young men,<br>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets\u2026those <br>hearts pierced by the gray lead,<br>Cold and motionless as they seem\u2026live elsewhere <br>with unslaughter'd vitality.<br>They live in other young men, O Kings,<br>They live in brothers again ready to defy you:<br>They were purified by death\u2026They were taught and <br>exalted.<br>Not a grave of the murdered for freedom but sows seed <br>for freedom\u2026in its turn to bear seed, <br>Which the winds carry afar and resow, and the rains <br>and the snows nourish. <br>Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let <br>loose, <br>But it stalks invisibly o'er the earth\u2026whispering,<br> counselling, cautioning.</p><p>Since the foregoing was written\u2014and it has been awaiting its turn at the printing press some months\u2014Mr. WALT. WHITMAN has published an enlarged edition of his works, from which it is fair to infer that his first has had a ready sale. From twelve poems, of which the original book was composed, he has brought the number up to thirty, all characterized by the same wonderful amalgamation of beauty and indecency. He has, however, been in his new edition guilty of a fresh immodesty. He has not alone printed Mr. EMERSON's private letter in an appendix, but he has absolutely printed a passage of that gentleman's note, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career,' in gold letters on the back, and affixed the name of the writer. Now, Mr. EMERSON wrote a not very wise letter to Mr. WHITMAN on the publication of the first twelve poems\u2014indorsing them, and so there might be some excuse for the poet's anxiety to let the public know that his first edition was commended from such a quarter. But with the additional poems, Mr. EMERSON has certainly nothing whatever to do; nevertheless, the same note that indorsed the twelve is used by Mr. WHITMAN in the coolest manner to indorse the thirty-two. This is making a private letter go very far indeed. It is as if after a man signed a deed, the person interested should introduce a number of additional clauses, making the original signature still cover them. It is a literary fraud, and Mr. WHITMAN ought to be ashamed of himself.</p><p>Still, this man has brave stuff in him. He is truly astonishing. The originality of his philosophy is of little account, for if it is truth, it must be ever the same, whether uttered by his lips or PLATO's. In manner only can we be novel, and truly Mr. WHITMAN is novelty itself. Since the greater portion of this review was written, we confess to having been attracted again and again to Leaves of Grass. It has a singular electric attraction. Its manly vigor, its brawny health, seem to incite and satisfy. We look forward with curious anticipation to Mr. WALT. WHITMAN's future works. We are much mistaken if, after all, he does not yet contribute something to American literature which shall awaken wonder.</p>", "date": "November 13 1856", "year": 1856, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Daily Times", "citation": " [Unknown]. \"Leaves of Grass.\" 13 November 1856.

Here it is, and with it we close our notice:</p><p>Up to the present, as helps best, the people, like a lot of large boys, have no determined tastes, are quite unaware of the grandeur of themselves, and of their destiny, and of their immense strides\u2014accept with voracity whatever is presented them in novels, histories, newspapers, poems, schools, lectures, every thing. Pretty soon, through these and other means, their development makes the fiber that is capable of itself, and will assume determined tastes. The young men will be clear what they want, and will have it. They will follow none except him whose spirit leads them in the like spirit with themselves. Any such man will be welcome as the flowers of May. Others will be put out without ceremony.

Y.</p><p>This is a new, enlarged and stereotyped edition of that singular production of 'Walt Whitman,' whose first appearance in '55 created such an extraordinary sensation in the literary world on both sides of the Atlantic. The first edition\u2014which was duly noticed in these columns\u2014contained twelve poems. In the present edition those poems are revised, and twenty others are added. The form of the book has been changed from 4 to 16mo, and the typography is much improved.</p><p>The work, in its singular character, we understand to be an assertion of a two-fold individuality for the author: of himself personally, and of himself nationally; and the author, by example at least, to be an advocate of as much for all of his nation. A bold example he sets. The titles of the poems are various, and the poems under them present differences; yet through them all, with whatever else, runs one vital view; one ontological lesson in the same idiosyncratic strain.</p><p>Fanciful, fertile, and free in words, yet often, conventionally speaking, inelegant, and sometimes downright low; simple, abrupt, and detached sentences; frequently aphoristic, yet diffuse and uniform, sometimes to tediousness; at times strikingly clear and forcible, and again impenetrably obscure; a meeting of the extremes of literalness and metaleptic figures\u2014of tiresome superficial details and comprehensive subtle generalities, oddities, ruggedness and strength; these are the chief characteristics of his style. There occur frequent instances of all- important and majestic thought, and so fitly expressed that the dissonance to the unaccustomed ears of the reader cannot prevent his stopping to admire. The matter is characterized by thought rather than by sentiment. The right and duty of man with the passions are enjoined and celebrated, rather than the passions themselves. There are speculative philosophies advanced, upon which readers will differ with the author and with each other; and some of these to intolerant conventionalists will give offense. We are not prepared to endorse them all ourselves. And there are practical philosophies of which he treats, destined to encounter fiercer repugnance. But the book is not one that warrants its dismissal with disgust or contempt. There is a deep substratum of observant and contemplative wisdom as broad as the foundation of society, running through it all; and whatever else there is of questionable good, so much at least is a genuine pearl that we cannot afford to trample it under our feet. The poems contain some lessons of the highest importance, and possess a further value in their strong suggestiveness. We accord to the leading idea of the work alone, personal with national individuality, exemplified and recommended as it is, an incalculable value. The poems improve upon a second reading, and they may commonly require a repetition in order to [gain] a deserved appreciation, like a strange piece of music with subtle harmonies.</p><p>The work is altogether sui generis, unless we may call it Emersonian. That name is ample enough to cover a multitude of oddities and excellencies; but that it is not shaped to all the radiations of the unbridled muse of the author under notice we think a single extract from his first poem will show:</p><p>I am the poet of the body,<br>And I am the poet of the soul.<br>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains <br>of hell are with me,<br>The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter <br>I translate into a new tongue.<br>I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br>And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a <br>man,<br>And I say there is nothing greater than the mother <br>of men.<br>I chant a new chant of dilation or pride,<br>We have had ducking and deprecating about <br>enough,<br>I show that size is only developement.</p><p>Have you outstript the rest?

Mr. Whitman\u2014or 'Walt. Whitman' as he styles himself\u2014has generally been considered by his acquaintances as a man of more eccentricity than genius or practical talent, and we think this volume does not wholly belie such reputation. The poems, 'Leaves of Grass,' or poem with variations, which it is rather, is the loudest and lustiest specimen of egotism with which types ever had to do. Walter sings the manhood, health, strength, beauty, dignity, passions and peculiarities of 'Walt. Whitman,' an American\u2014one of the roughs\u2014a kosmos, and what he says he will, he does\u2014'utters his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' He holds 'Walt.' to be a type and large specimen of universal manhood, just as good and no better than any or every other man\u2014and woman! for her claims the blossom and crown for the motherly sex!</p><p>Starting with this proposition, 'Walt.' 'loafs' or 'spreads himself,' as he chances to think most illustrative. He tries his hand at universal occupation; sees great nobleness in the earth-delver and the sky-soarer; in clam-digging and ship-building, and swears\u2014frequently\u2014that there is more music in a broad axe, the rattle of a clam-rake, and the hi! hi's! of healthy Americans, than in never-so-much psalm-singing and opera. Patriotic, loving, idle, loafing, and independent is 'Walt. Whitman' in his 'Leaves of Grass.' His wild, strange, nonchalant song, puts us in mind of Ecclesiastes; and in many of its thoughts and images, it is as vigorous and abrupt as that peculiar Bible poem. But with all its merits\u2014its wonderful use of the English language, its endless hints of knowledge, its evidences of minute and extensive observation, its powers of fancy, satire and sarcasm, and its often sublime and exquisite touches of poetry\u2014it is a repulsive and nasty book. On exhibiting himself, like the silly ostrich, the poet hastens to hide his better, and expose his more indecent parts\u2014as though it were necessary to truth or manliness, to unduly expose human or other nature.</p><p>We have read the book, but cannot say with Emerson that we think it 'the beginning of a great career,' or that we could conscientiously hope for its wide circulation. We believe that all essential knowledge and truth, and all valuable ideas and fancies, may be projected and propagated without special resort to slang and obscenity.\u2014'Walt.' bares himself quite too literally for our taste. His 'Leaves of Grass' may be proper food for any generation of immaculate purists, but the earth and society are not yet ripe enough for the grazing of that class of 'critters.' The 'Come-outers' and 'free Lovers' are the only ones at present fitted to do full homage to the genius displayed in 'Leaves of Grass.' It will become a 'Household Book of Poetry' just about as soon as that other volume of which we read in advertisements, but never see in any household.</p>", "date": "December 10 1858", "year": 1858, "creator": "George Hull Shepard", "publication": "The Long-Islander", "citation": "Shepard, George Hull [unsigned in original]. \"Leaves of Grass.\" 10 December 1858.

Year 85 of the States\u20141860-61. 1 vol., pp. 456.</p><p>Five years ago a new poet appeared, styling himself the representative of America, the mouthpiece of free institutions, the personification of all that men had waited for. His writings were neither poetry nor prose, but a curious medley, a mixture of quaint utterances and gross indecencies, a remarkable compound of fine thoughts and sentiment of the pot-house. It was not an easy task to winnow the chaff from the wheat, the tares came up in such heavy luxuriance that they stunted the chance kernels of the grain, and nothing but the most vigorous of threshing was adequate to the elimination of one pure thought. That first edition of the Leaves of Grass was the earliest appearance of Mr. WALT. WHITMAN as an author. For a debutant, he was sufficiently egotistic and assuming. He announced, with a degree of confidence which could only have been the natural result of unparalleled self-conceit, that his mission lay in the reformation of the public taste, that the American people were to be enlightened and civilized and cultivated up to the proper standard, by virtue of his superior endowments, and that, being 'a Kosmos,' and inclined to 'loafe' at his ease, and 'invite his soul,' he could afford to wait for the public's warm appreciation of his self-sacrifice, and to recline in a comfortable attitude until the world saw fit to come round to him. Two years after the publication of the first thin and unprepossessing volume of the Leaves, a larger edition appeared, and that again is followed by a third and still more pretentious book, the present issue from the Boston house of THAYER & ELDRIDGE.</p><p>Mr. WHITMAN has added to this volume a large collection of his writings which have never been given to the public. If possible, he is more reckless and vulgar than in his two former publications. He seems to delight in the contemplation of scenes that ordinary men do not love, or which they are content to regard as irremediable evils, about which it is needless to repine. Mr. WHITMAN sees nothing vulgar in that which is commonly regarded as the grossest obscenity; rejects the laws of conventionality so completely as to become repulsive; gloats over coarse images with the gusto of a RABELAIS,1 but lacks the genius or the grace of RABELAIS to vivify or adorn that which, when said at all, should be said as delicately as possible.</p><p>Yet it would be unjust to deny the evidences of remarkable power which are presented in this work. In his hearty human sympathy, his wonderful intensity, his fullness of epithet, the author shows that he is a man of strong passion, vigorous in thought and earnest in purpose. He is uncultured, rude, defiant and arrogant, but these are faults of his nature which have not been tempered by severe training. Occasionally, a gleam of the true poetic fire shines out of the mass of his rubbish, and there are tender and beautiful touches in the midst of his most objectionable and disagreeable writings. A rough diamond, much in need of cutting and grinding and polishing, he has great intrinsic worth, but the impurities which cling about him must keep him out of the refined company he desires to enter. To be an agent for the civilization of men, he must first himself become civilized. He can do no manner of good by throwing filth, even though a handful of pure gold be sometimes mingled with a cast from his moral cesspool.</p><p>Nearly two hundred poems, of all sizes and qualities, are contained in this edition. Two dozens of these are properly the Leaves of Grass, grouped under that title, and mainly published in former editions. Chants Democratic and Native American comprise twenty- one curious specimens of composition, which are neither metrical nor harmonious. Fifteen others are collected under the comprehensive heading of Enfans d'Adam, and are humanitary. Fifteen others are Messenger Leaves. Four hundred and fifty pages of these productions establish the industry of the writer; and the fact that a respectable house has undertaken their publication, illustrates a lively faith in the eagerness of the public for the reception of novelties.</p><p>Some of the finer passages in this intricate maze of incongruous materials occur in the first hundred pages. Take the following weird conceit:</p><p>A child said: What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands.<br>How could I answer the child? I do not know what <br>it is, any more than he.<br>\u2026I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, <br>that we may see and remark, and say, Whose?<br>\u2026Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the pro- <br>duced babe of the vegetation:<br>\u2026And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair <br>of graves.</p><p>In 'Chants Democratic,' the poet discourses of strong wills, and mirrors the image of the reformer.</p><p>How beggarly appear poems, arguments, ora-<br>tions, before an electric deed!<br>How the floridness of the materials of cities shriv- <br>els before a man's or woman's look!<br>All waits, or goes by default, till a strong being ap-<br>pears;<br>A strong being is the proof of the race, and of the<br> ability of the universe;<br>When he or she appears, materials are overawed,<br>The dispute on the Soul stops,<br>The old customs and phrases are confronted, turned <br>back, or laid away.</p><p>Again, he studies faces, and draws sharply-lined portraits:</p><p>This face is a life-boat;<br>This is the face commanding and bearded; it asks <br>no odds of the rest;<br>This face is flavored fruit, ready for eating;<br>This face of a healthy, honest boy, is the programme <br>of all good.</p><p>Yet the tendency to fall into the vulgar, apparently ineradicable in Mr. WHITMAN'S composition, leads him to interlard with these such expressions as 'abject louse, asking leave to be'\u2014'milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to its hole'\u2014'dog's snout, sniffing for garbage.' He will be gross, and there is no help for it.</p><p>The egotism of the book is amusing. Mr. WHITMAN is not only 'a man-myself, typical before all,' but he is 'a man thirty-six years old in the year 79 of America, and is here anyhow'\u2014but, being here, lies in libraries 'as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,' thereby evincing a hearty contempt for scholastic culture; but nevertheless avowing a stern determination to:</p><p>\u2026make a song for these States,<br>\u2026and a shrill song of curses on him who would <br>dissever the Union.</p><p>It is fair to presume that this 'song of curses,' should it ever come to be sung, will be 'shrill,' and loud, not to say foul and abusive. Mr. WHITMAN is master of the art.</p><p>A better passage is that in which he describes the effect of music upon himself:</p><p>The orchestra wrenches such ardors from me, I did <br>not know I possessed them,<br>It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror;<br>It sails me\u2014I dab with bare feet\u2014they are licked by <br>the indolent waves,<br>I am exposed, cut by bitter and poisoned hail,<br>Steeped amid honeyed morphine, my windpipe throttled <br>in fakes of death,<br>At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,<br>And that we call Being.</p><p>There is great power in this passage;\u2014rude strength, unpolished but vigorous.</p><p>A lover of nature, he sees all natural things through a pleasant medium. Trees, birds, fish alike delight him; he loves:</p><p>The cheerful voice of the public road\u2014the gay fresh <br>sentiment of the road.<p><p>He sees Deity in everything:</p><p>\u2026finds letters from God dropped in the street\u2014 <br>and every one is signed by God's name.</p><p>He loves the stillness of night, and apostrophizes it with passionate vehemence;</p><p>Press close, bare-bosomed Night!

It is Walt Whitman. The proof of his greatness is in his book; and there is proof enough.</p><p>The intellectual attitude expressed in these Leaves of Grass, is grand with the grandeur of independent strength, and beautiful with the beauty of serene repose. It is the attitude of a proud, noble, vigorous life. A human heart is here in these pages\u2014large, wild, comprehensive\u2014beating with all throbs of passion\u2014enjoying all of bliss\u2014suffering all of sorrow that is possible to humanity. 'This is no book,' it says; 'whoever touches this, touches a man.' It is the electrical contact of a great nature.</p><p>\u2014'No dainty dolce affettuoso I; <br>Bearded, sunburnt, gray-necked, forbidding, I have  <br>arrived, <br>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the  <br>universe, <br>For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them. . . . <br>I, exultant, will now shake out carols stronger and  <br>haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon the  <br>earth. . . . <br>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with  <br>reference to all days, <br>And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a  <br>poem, but has reference to the Soul, <br>Because, having looked at the objects of the universe,  <br>I find there is no one, nor any particle of one, but  <br>has reference to the Soul. <br>I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed  <br>babe, and am not contained between my hat and boots . . . <br>I exist as I am\u2014that is enough, <br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content, <br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content. . . . <br>I am the poet of the body, <br>And I am the poet of the soul. <br>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of  <br>hell are with me, <br>The first I graft and increase upon myself\u2014the latter I  <br>translate into a new tongue. <br>I know perfectly well my own egotism. . . . <br>I am an acme of things accomplished, and I am an en- <br>closer of things to be.'</p><p>Such is the intellectual attitude of the Leaves of Grass; such the position and purpose of their author. To accept everything as liberally as Nature accepts everything; to rightly appreciate all laws and all things, each thing in its place; to realize, reflect, and reproduce the emotions of every heart and the experiences of every person; to recognize and assert the universal harmony of creation; to know the beautiful union of Body and Soul in the individual, sublime in the present, and with a sublime destiny for the future; to repose in the certainty of infinite development and progression; to assert the individual above all things, knowing that 'nothing endures but personal quality'; to express for all mankind what all mankind feel without the power of expressing; to live the comprehensive life of the Philosopher, of the Poet, broad and vigorous, all lives in one,\u2014reaching up into heaven, reaching down into hell, stretching backward over all the Past to gather up its results, throbbing with all the vital activity of the Present, making the Future glorious with more than hope,\u2014this is the aim and the mission of Walt Whitman, this the felicity of his life as expressed in his poems. No man could utter himself more fully and truly. No book exists anywhere more beautifully in earnest than this. To the intelligent, sympathetic mind, none can explain itself with keener accuracy.</p><p>\u2014'I will make the poems of materials, for I think  <br>they are to be the most spiritual poems, <br>And I will make the poems of my body and of mor- <br>tality, <br>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems  <br>of my Soul and of immortality. . . . <br>I will acknowledge contemporary lands, <br>I will trail the whole geography of the globe, and salute cour- <br>teously every city large and small; <br>And employments! I will put in my poems, that with  <br>you is heroism, upon land and sea. . . . <br>And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in  <br>me\u2014For I am determined to tell you with coura- <br>geous clear voice, to prove you illustrious. . . . <br>Omnes! Omnes! <br>Let others ignore what they may, <br>I make the poem of evil also\u2014I commemorate that  <br>part also, <br>I am myself just as much evil as good\u2014And I say there  <br>is in fact no evil, <br>Or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to  <br>the earth, or to me, as anything else. <br>I too, following many, and followed by many, inaugu- <br>rate a Religion\u2014I too go to the wars, <br>I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all\u2014And  <br>I will be the bard of Personality; <br>And I will show of male and female that either is but  <br>the equal of the other, <br>And I will show that there is no imperfection in male  <br>or female, or in the earth, or in the present\u2014and  <br>can be none in the future, <br>And I will show that whatever happens to anybody, it  <br>may be turned to beautiful results\u2014And I will  <br>show that nothing can happen more beautiful  <br>than death; <br>And I will thread a thread through my poems that no  <br>one thing in the universe is inferior to another  <br>thing, <br>And that all the things of the universe are perfect  <br>miracles, each as profound as any. . . . . <br>These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands\u2014they  <br>are not original with me, <br>If they are not yours as much as mine, they are  <br>nothing, or next to nothing.'. . . .</p><p>The leading idea in the philosophy of the Leaves of Grass is the idea of grandeur and supremacy in the Individual. It asserts that there is nothing more divine than the human soul, and impels to a knowledge of living motive behind each thing and every action. It will have the singer and not the psalm, the preacher and not the script he preaches. It will not ignore the Body, but asserts its beauty and the divine harmony of Body and Soul.</p><p>\u2026'I believe in you, my Soul\u2014the other I am must not abase itself to you, <br>And you must not be abased to the other. . . . . <br>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of  <br>any man hearty and clean, <br>Not an inch, nor a particle of an inch, is vile, and none  <br>shall be less familiar than the rest\u2026 <br>I believe in the flesh and the appetites, <br>Seeing, hearing, and feeling are miracles, and each tag  <br>and part of me is a miracle.\u2014</p><p>It finds all things embraced and comprehended in the individual, to whom indeed the universe belongs and who belongs to the universe. It recognizes the common brotherhood of mankind, and the same human nature repeated in every person. Its aspiration is for a noble race of human creatures, healthy and beautiful, living delightfully, in sympathy with Nature, their perfect lives in a perfect world.</p><p>Perhaps the scope and significance of Walt Whitman's poetry may be more clearly indicated by contrasting its character with that of the poetry ordinarily accepted and popular at the present time. The latter is rhymed and measured. It is sometimes powerful with passion and sometimes stately with thought. It is generally sweet and graceful\u2014expressing mild and monotonous sentiments in a thousand respectable ways. It is gay for a feast and sorry for a funeral. It is sweet as to Spring-time, and thoughtful as to sober Autumn days. It rhymes 'kisses' with 'blisses,' and expresses its writer's willingness to partake of the same. It mourns persistently for dead infants, for those who are snatched away in beauty's bloom, and for blighted blossoms generally. It has an amatory tendency, of a sentimental description, and wastes a good deal of miscellaneous sweetness. It presents its author as one who desires burial under a sweet- apple tree, and will not have a decent graveyard on any terms; it affects to ignore and despise the human body; it dwells fondly upon the sublime nature and destiny of the soul; and passing smoothly over all that is significant in this actual present life, it hints lugubriously at another and a better world. On the other hand these poems of Walt Whitman concern themselves alike with the largest and with the pettiest topics. They are free as the wandering wind that sweeps over great oceans and inland seas, over the continents of the world, over mountains, forests, rivers, plains, and cities; free as the sunshine are they, and like the sunshine ardent and fierce. Nothing in the creation is too sacred or too distant for the lightning glance of their aspiration; nothing that in any way concerns the souls and the bodies of the human race is too trivial for their comprehension. Everywhere they evince the philosophic mind, deeply seeking, reasoning, feeling its way toward a clear knowledge of the system of the universe.</p><p>On my way a moment I pause, <br>Here for you! And here for America! <br>Still the Present I raise aloft\u2014Still the Future of The  <br>States I harbinge, glad and sublime, <br>And for the Past I pronounce what the air holds of the red  <br>aborigines. . . . . <br>Stop this day and night with me, and you shall pos-  <br>sess the origin of all poems; <br>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun\u2014there  <br>are millions of suns left; <br>You shall no longer take things at second or third  <br>hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor  <br>feed on the spectres in books. . . . . <br>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of  <br>my own, <br>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my  <br>own, <br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers,  <br>and the women my sisters and lovers, <br>And that a kelson of the creation is love. . . . <br>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-  <br>work of the stars, <br>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand,  <br>and the egg of the wren, <br>And the tree-toad is a chef-d'\u0153uvre for the highest, <br>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, <br>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all  <br>machinery, <br>And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses  <br>any statue, <br>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions  <br>of infidels, <br>And I could come every afternoon of my life to look  <br>at the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-kettle  <br>and baking short-cake.'</p><p>In this liberal scope of vision and purpose are indicated the insight and the earnestness characteristic of a poetic nature. Other elements of that poetic nature are evident in the vigor of imagination and splendor of imagery which make certain of these poems so truly remarkable. In the 'Salut au Monde'; in the poem called 'A Word Out of the Sea'\u2014which, under the title of 'A Child's Reminiscence,' was printed in this paper last December; in the poem of 'Brooklyn Ferry'; in that of 'Sleep Chasings,' and that of 'Burial';\u2014in these, and in others, such qualities largely and beautifully appear.</p><p>Some reflections may properly be submitted here, relative to the form in which Walt Whitman's poems are embodied and expressed. It is a form so rough and rugged\u2014so careless, variable, and peculiar\u2014that perhaps it is very natural the poetry should sometimes degenerate into prose. Something is to be said, however, in defence of this system of versification. It is at least original. The theory would seem to be, as Walt has variously indicated, that always the thought or the passion of the poet should determine itself in natural, congenial expression. It is assumed in this theory, and indeed it is very true, that much of the verse ordinarily written, is written without a sincere motive, and has therefore neither power nor value. It is further assumed that the styles of versification generally accredited and employed are inadequate to the utterance of earnest thought and feeling. Consequently, Walt Whitman, who presents himself as the Poet of the American Republic in the Present Age, who is actuated by a sincere motive, and has earnest thought and feeling to express, refuses to confine and cripple himself within the laws of what to him is inefficient art. Reverencing the spirit of poetry above the form, he submits that the one shall determine the other. That his volume is poetic in spirit cannot rationally be denied; and, whatever the eccentricities of its form, no critical reader can fail to perceive that the expression seems always the suitable and natural result of the thought. It is indeed tame and prosy in the conveyance of any commonplace idea or feeling, but it rises and melts into sweet and thrilling music whenever impelled by the beautiful impulse of a grand thought or emotion.</p><p>A fine example of this felicity of style occurs in the following beautiful passage, which also delightfully illustrates the poet's ardent and profound love of Nature:</p><p>'I am He that walks with the tender and growing Night, <br>I call to the earth and sea, half-held by the Night. <br>Press close, bare-bosomed Night! Press close, magnetic,  <br>nourishing Night! <br>Night of south winds! Night of the large few stars! <br>Still, nodding night! Mad, naked, summer night. <br>Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breathed Earth! <br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! <br>Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains, mis- <br>ty-topt! <br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with  <br>blue! <br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the  <br>river! <br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clear- <br>er for my sake! <br>Far-swooping elbowed Earth! Rich, apple-blossomed  <br>Earth! <br>Smile, for YOUR LOVER comes! . . . . <br>I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven, <br>O suns! O grass of graves! O perpetual transfers and  <br>promotions! <br>If you do not say anything, how can I say anything? <br>Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, <br>Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight. <br>Toss, sparkles of day and dusk! toss on the black  <br>stems that decay in the muck! <br>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.'</p><p>Another fine example is found in the following bit of description, which has all that simplicity can give of power, pathos, and music:</p><p>'Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf\u2014posh and ice  <br>in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray  <br>discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight  <br>of Twelfth Month, <br>A hearse and stages\u2014other vehicles give place\u2014the  <br>funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, the cor- <br>tege mostly drivers. <br>Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-  <br>bell, the gate is passed, the new-dug grave is halt- <br>ed at, the living alight, the hearse uncloses, <br>The coffin is passed out, lowered and settled, the whip  <br>is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled  <br>in, <br>The mound above is flatted with the spades\u2014silence, <br>A minute, no one moves or speaks\u2014it is done, <br>He is decently put away\u2014is there anything more? <br>He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tempered,  <br>not bad-looking, able to take his own part, witty,  <br>sensitive to a slight, ready with life or death for a  <br>friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank  <br>hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew  <br>low-spirited toward the last, sickened, was helped  <br>by a contribution, died, aged forty-one years\u2014and  <br>that was his funeral.</p><p>Of the defects in this book something also may properly be said. They are not trivial and they are not few. It is the law of a great nature to err greatly as well as to be greatly wise. Walt Whitman has exemplified that law. There are, as it seems to us, defects alike in his philosophy, art, taste, and style. It is fair to say there is much in his book that, like the peace of God, passeth all understanding, and that it does not lack passages which should never have been published at all. We may have occasion to refer to this book again, and to explain ourselves more fully in these regards. Meantime we submit, as appropriate in this connection, the following critical remarks from the North American Review:</p><p>'For the purpose of showing that he is above every conventionalism, Mr. Whitman puts into the book one or two lines which he would not address to a woman nor to a company of men. There is not anything, perhaps, which modern usage would stamp as more indelicate than are some passages in Homer. There is not a word in it meant to attract readers by its grossness, as there is in half the literature of the last century, which holds its place unchallenged on the tables of our drawing-rooms. For all that, it is a pity that a book where everything else is natural, should go out of the way to avoid the suspicion of being prudish.'</p><p>We should not conclude our notice of the Leaves of Grass without expressing our very great delight at the sumptuous elegance of the style in which Messrs. Thayer & Eldridge have published Walt Whitman's poetry. The volume presents one of the richest specimens of taste and skill in book-making, that has ever been afforded to the public by either an English or an American publisher.</p>", "date": "May 19 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "Henry Clapp", "publication": "The New York Saturday Press", "citation": "Clapp, Henry [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman.\" 19 May 1860.

We have looked for it with more than ordinary interest, as men look for good tidings from a far country. For this man, we know, has a message, no matter how uncouth the form of it, to deliver to us, and to this generation. An authentic message!\u2014which he has not learned in any school, at second hand, or gathered from books\u2014or torn from parchment records, long since dead in monastic graves\u2014but alive with God and the great fiery heart of the universe to-day, full of wild eloquence, and of all manner of intellectual and spiritual magnetisms.</p><p>It is not some seven, or eight, or more years ago, since this author\u2014this Manhattan poet, who gives us so many antique and modern thoughts, so many new, strange, and startling images, and things suggestive of an imagery, which has no material archetype\u2014cast his first grass leaves upon the waters, hoping as the prophecy declares of all vital things, that he should find them again\u2014and that the world should find them\u2014after many days. We, for one, carefully reading them at the time, had no manner of doubt nor shadow of a misgiving that such in their case, would be the issue. And here, after so long a lapse of time,\u2014hundreds and thousands of highly bepraised books, in the mean while, having passed through the fires to Molech,1 and having been there consumed in the Gehenna Hell which is the just doom-place of rubbish\u2014hundreds and thousands more still following them day by day, and will still continue to follow them until men cease to be fools\u2014here we say is this book of Grass Leaves as fresh as ever, as redolent as ever of May flowers, and meadow bloom, and the aroma of woods and prairies.</p><p>We find many things new and old in this book; the old, welcome as the familiar faces of the old Gods to the first lovers and worshipers of the Gods\u2014the new, bright with a radiance which is all their own, and welcome also for their surpassing beauty, and the new life which they bring. For these poems of Walt Whitman are no silly word-catching\u2014no mere musical claptrap done into dainty feet with measured and mathematical precision\u2014but they are the very life of the man, fragments both of his body and soul, with a genuine creative power in them big enough to create a soul under the ribs of death himself. The strongest man may refresh himself at the fountains of this shaggy aboriginal giant\u2014who sits on the threshold of nature's arcane\u2014his hands full of sunbeams; his mouth musical with so many sweet laughters, his whole face illuminated with the wise and beneficent mirth of the arcane Gods.</p><p>And if any one be inclined to call this rhapsody, let him prove his right to speak by producing his letters of competency. To all cavillers, questioners, and doubters, to all flippant young gentlemen of the French school, who do the brilliant for Bohemian clubs and Bohemian newspapers, to all drawing-room Fire-flies, and Will-o'-the-Wisps in general. who have so much to say and say nothing, we will offer them this admonishment: Hold your peace. This man is not for you, nor such as you. He speaks to men, not to lumbering journeymen, nor conceited apes, nor to anything of the breed of these. But if a brave, truthful reader, who is not afraid of hearing much that is too Hebraic to be polite, which any vulgar mind can make vulgar, and obscene ever, but which from the author's stand-point is by no means vulgar, but as sacred as the soul itself\u2014if, we say, he be not afraid of such sentence as these, but will bear with them, and get their value out of them, whatever it may prove to be to him, for the sake of other and infinitely better, purer, wiser matters which he will assuredly find in these poems, we can commend and authorize him to address himself straightway to the work.</p><p>For the first time in American history a native poet sings to us of America. Your Longfellows, and Lowells, and Whittier\u2014your male-men writers of all sorts, and your female-women writers of all sorts, may, if they please, and as they please, ignore America and its grand people and institutions, the struggles, battles, and conquests, the hopes, and loves, and hates, and all the fiery passions of the people; may write themselves unbelievers in the destiny of American civilization, atheists to their country, and go along to their lives' end, singing their dead songs about dead Europe, and its stupid monks and priests, its chivalry, and its thing a-my-bobs called kings\u2014but not so this new comer, and great believer, this devout and prophetic son of America, born of the people of the soil. For him, to-day, is as great as any yesterday; as full, too, of romance and poetry; for he brings with him the eyes to see and the ears to hear, and the words to speak all the things which he thinketh. God has so gifted this new man, and has so educated him with faith in the present and the actual, in the future and the inevitable.</p><p>He sees nothing mean and low, nothing common any where around him. He is entranced by the miracle of existence, and wonder worlds open beneath him and around him wherever he walks, whatever he touches. All material things are suspended upon a scaffolding of impalpable thought\u2014a living scaffolding of thought which, indeed, is the only reality; the material, being a phantasm which it projects, and to which it gives shape and form, motive and activity. This orientalism of vision, however, so far from being offensive, or even obtrusive, is the great underlying charm of the book, and its chief fascination, by which he holds the right reader with a magnetism as strong as the Poles. he is the most oriental and the most American of Americans. A strong, practical common sense runs through all his sentences; and he every where calls things by their right names, and uses no rosewater. You shall laugh and cry with him\u2014but no man can laugh at him\u2014even in his bluntest, rudest and most informal speech. We can see that whatsoever appertains to the honor, interest, learning, literature, culture, manners, laws and government of America, is very dear to him; dearer than all the world beside; and we love him for his love of this great and magnificent land. Legislators and literats, and office-seekers, and brilliant beer-drinkers, and grog drinkers, and the mob who hate law and government, may forget that they are Americans\u2014may defame and traduce their country, sell its honor for a mess of pottage or try to make it a French stew by inoculating us with French notions, French books and French morals and habits\u2014but not so, Whitman! True as the needle to the North is he true to his country, to the brave mother language, and to the American people.</p><p>We are well aware, and so doubtless is he that from the very structure and form of his verse he is more open to parody and burlesque than any living writer. Smart young gentle men of the ginger-beer sort, have tried their hands with immense success at this work\u2014hitting us and the form, and, as usual, missing the spirit, the genius, the fine aroma of thought which breathe through the original. We are not disposed to give unqualified praise to Mr. Whitman, and we honestly think that he has written many things which, considering that women also and young girls go to make up the world, he might far better have left unwritten. We have no faith in Priapus, nor in the Phallic Symbolism. All that kind of worship and literature is long since dead for all good purposes\u2014and needs no revival. And it seems sad to us\u2014speaking from the common platform of the sexes\u2014that so admirable a book should be marred by passages which put a taint upon its general purity.</p><p>People call Whitman an egotist\u2014and he is no doubt an egotist of the most imperial sort. But he often speaks in his own name, when he represents the 'Cosmos,' and all nature and humanity. The reader must not always confound his personal pronouns with the poet's license of universality. He often speaks for the race when he appears to be speaking for himself. There can be no question, however, that Leaves of Grass are, on the whole, as genuine a piece of autobiography as that of Augustine, or Gibbon, or the Confessions of Rosseau.</p><p>And for the claims of this book to be called a book of poems, we will venture to say that there is more true poetry in it than would float any dozen modern volumes which the critics dignify with the name of poetry.

The 'Distinctive American Poem'\u2014the only one (God be thanked!) The country has yet produced\u2014has appeared.</p><p>Lying before me as I write is an early copy of 'Leaves of Grass.' I have awaited its advent with some little anxiety, for I had been forced to extend to the later effusions of its author, a degree of admiration. I could not shut my eyes to their wild, rough beauty nor close my soul to the truths they expressed. Defiant of all precedent, scornful of all the conventionalisms of art, there was in them all a rude, grand sweep, as natural, and as musical too, as the breaking of the waves upon the shore, or the singing of the winds at night through the forest.</p><p>So when yesterday the looked-for volume reached me, you may be assured that it was eagerly opened. In the few hours that I have had the work, I have found time to read but little of it. That little, however, has sufficed! I lack inclination now for its further perusal.</p><p>After this frank confession, do not think that I purpose a review of the work. I have no such intention. I write simply to express my unqualified disgust with the portions I have read. Whether those portions are the best, or the worst, or an average, I do not know nor care to know. I opened the book at random, as one does a new book when leisure is wanting, and read what the pages before me held.</p><p>I make no quotations from those pages. I would offer neither to The Press, nor its readers, the offence of spreading before them even the daintiest lines those pages of filth contain. Until such time as the novels of de Kock find place upon parlor tables, and the obscene pictures, which boys in your city slily offer for sale upon the wharves, are admitted to albums, or grace drawing-room walls, quotations from Enfans d'Adam would be an offence against decency too gross to be tolerated.</p><p>I am not at all squeamish. Not easily shocked either. I adore the beautiful, and grow impassioned as I drink in the voluptuous in art or poesy. Amorous poetry, so far from being to me offensive, is delightful, and the soft, liquid lines of tender love, and the deep strains of a burning passion, seem to me alike fit hymns for man to offer up. But Walt Whitman's poems are not amorous; they are only beastly. They express far more truthfully the feelings of brute nature than the sentiments of human love.</p><p>Walt Whitman assumes to regard woman only as an instrument for the gratification of his desires, and the propagation of the species. To him all women are the same, with but this difference, the more sensual have the preference, as they promise greater indulgence. His exposition of his thoughts shows conclusively that with him the congress of the sexes is a purely animal affair, and with his ridiculous egotism he vaunts his prowess as a stock-breeder might that of the pick of his herd.</p><p>It is bad enough, I submit, for a person to be so utterly brutalized. There needs not the further degradation of publishing his brutality. A true man regards the intimate relations he may sustain toward the woman who holds his affections as something too holy to be lightly talked of, too sacred to be bruited abroad. To the true man, the congress of the sexes is a sacrament, a holy secret locked in the breasts of two persons, which it were gross profanation to expose to the gaze of any beside. To such an one, all women are not the same nor is capacity for beastly indulgence the distinguishing trait of the chosen one. But it is unnecessary for me to dilate upon this. All will feel what I might say in this connection.</p><p>Walt Whitman has had a narrow escape from being a great poet. He combines in him all the requisites but one; but that one is indispensable. He has strength, he has beauty, but he has no soul. Intellect, I grant, wide in its scope, and powerful in its grasp. Yet with all this, I doubt if, when the Judgment-Day comes, Walt Whitman's name will be called. He certainly has not enough soul to be saved. I hardly think he has enough to be damned.</p><p>Walt Whitman has done his work. He has shown to the world that one may have the form and presence of a man, may possess an intellect whose scope and power entitle him to high place among the gifted ones of earth, and yet in those finer qualities which most intimately connect man with higher intelligences, be utterly wanting, and at the poor level of 'the beasts that perish.'</p><p>He has done this, and the world has now no further need of him. It accepts the revolting lesson, as it must, but it does not need the teacher longer. If Walt has left within him any charity, will he not now rid the taught and disgusted world of himself? Not by poison, or the rope, or pistol, or by any of the common modes of suicide, because some full man, to whom life has become a grievous burden, may at a later day be compelled to choose between death by the same means and a hateful life, and with the pride of noble manhood turn shuddering to live on, rather than admit so much of oneness as would be implied by going to death as did Walt Whitman. But let him search the coast of his island home until he finds some cove where the waves are accustomed to cast up the carrion committed to them, and where their bloated bodies ride lazily upon the waters which humanity never disturbs, and casting himself therein find at last the companionship for which, in death as in life, he is best fitted.</p><p>Let him do this act of reparation, and the world may kindly extend to him the charity of forgetfulness\u2014the highest boon it now can bestow.</p>", "date": "June 2 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "Calvin Beach [listed as Juliette H.

He is a printer by trade, as many other men distinguished in the annals of this country have been; and, by the force of his own native genius, has risen from the case to become one of the great lights and leaders of literature\u2014a poet whose broad and vigorous power and uncommon felicity of illustration is acknowledged wherever the English language is spoken. His first appearance before the public was in 1855, when he issued a small and unprepossessing edition of his 'Leaves of Grass,' previous to which, however, he had contributed some poems to the press, which attracted attention by their power and originality. On sending a copy of the first edition of his poems to Ralph Waldo Emerson, who is acknowledged to be the foremost man in modern literature, he received the following letter in reply:</p><p>CONCORD, Mass., July 21, 1855.</p><p>DEAR SIR:\u2014I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of 'Leaves of Grass.' I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the temperament, were making our western wits fat and mean.</p><p>I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p><p>I did not know, until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper, that I could trust the name as real and available for a post-office. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.</p><p>R. W. EMERSON.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>This letter of the highest praise, from one of the greatest minds in the world, called the attention of many literary people to these new poems, and they were largely bought up. In 1856 he issued another and somewhat enlarged edition, which were speedily disposed of. An interim of four years has elapsed, and having had ample leisure in the meantime for composition of new pieces, he now comes before the public with a superb edition of his work, containing about twice as much matter as the first edition, the success of which has already been great, and must be enormous.</p><p>There is a great career in store for Walt Whitman, and we shall watch his future with interest. An interesting review of his work was given in the last number of the ILLUSTRATED NEWS.</p><p>The 'Leaves of Grass' is published by Thayer & Eldridge, of Boston, and the book\u2014take it altogether\u2014is, perhaps, the most magnificent specimen of typography ever issued by the American Press.</p>", "date": "June 2 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "George Searle Phillips", "publication": "The New-York Illustrated News", "citation": " Phillips, George Searle [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman.\" 2 June 1860.

BOSTON: THAYER AND ELDRIDGE.</p><p>The people who have not yet heard of Walt Whitman are few indeed. This last enlarged collection of his poems makes a stout volume, to which the bold and tasteful publishers have given a dress altogether striking, unique and original. All sorts of things - hard and soft -have been said by the literary critics about this same Walt Whitman and his writings. One paper, in commenting upon another's indiscriminate praise of him, remarks that it is 'into this gentle garden of the Muses that that unclean cub of the wilderness, Walt Whitman, has been suffered to intrude, trampling with his vulgar and profane hoofs among the delicate flowers which bloom there,' &c.</p><p>Nobody who has read Whitman's poems, can question his originality. He betrays high culture, even when he seems almost swinishly to spurn it. We think that few writers of our day, if any, whether in prose or verse, have so seized hold of the spirit of things\u2014no matter what, where found, or intertwisted with whatever associations\u2014as this one before us. And the best proof of it is just that free habit of expression which all the literary poodles are happy to style 'barbaric.' It is time their snobbery was supplanted by strength of some sort even if it be barbaric. We have had soft flute-blowing long enough; now let us bear the jarring screech of a fife. Our poet they call nasty, because he scorns to be knavish; he has the right of it, beyond a question, calling a spade a spade, and a meat-axe a meat-axe; and in exercising his elephantine strength and motions, he doubtless takes a secret delight in the mere act of exercising them, and holding all napper-tandy forms and by-laws in scorn; he proudly refuses to so much as appease the prejudices of critics by respecting the commonly received statutes of the great Literary Republic.</p><p>This man's verse\u2014wild, rapid, Ossianic,1 wailing, grand, humble, innocent, defiant, irregular, defective, overfull, and altogether inflexible as it is\u2014forms, after all, the truest illustration, if not representative, of the real American Age that is, and is to be. He has searched all truth, all knowledge, all science. Even when his expression torments you, the great, surcharged soul that throbs and plays underneath, looks forth serious and awful, refusing to be satisfied with itself, unsettling all things, breaking up the heavens into new and sometimes terrific forms, and pointing down to abysmal deeps in human experience, to which even the most powerful sight of spirit has never penetrated. Above all other singers of songs\u2014rude or rhyming\u2014Whitman hints to you of your capacity; if you have not yet awakened to the possession of any, you cannot understand him, of course. Neither can you understand him wholly, at best; for his own writings prove that he does not, and never will entirely, understand himself. And this is the mystery that gives Life its deep meaning.</p><p>The whole body of these Poems\u2014spiritually considered\u2014is alive with power, throbbing and beating behind and between the lines. There is more here than mere oddity, and barbaric indifference to elegant forms of speech; there is a living soul\u2014no matter whether its owner drove an omnibus once, or stands on State street and chaffers greedily every day for gold\u2014and that soul insists on giving itself to its fellows, even if it has to rend the most sacred rules of speech to achieve its larger liberty. Carlyle did so, and triumphed; Whitman's way is as much his own, too. It is no way at all, to make up even literary judgment by examining the colors, and not the warp and woof. It is the texture of the stuff that tells, because it is that which is going to endure.</p><p>Thus much of the Poet Whitman; we leave our readers to examine his wonderful productions\u2014so bizarre, so fine, so entirely out of and beyond all rule\u2014and know for themselves, as they would know a familiar friend, the spirit that lives in them. The disjecta membra 2 of the man's speech we throw to the hungry critics, who are ever delighted to snap up such meaty morsels; of the soul that burns through\u2014nay, burns up\u2014all the mere words, consuming the verbiage as fire licks up dried grass, we are but too eager to speak as it deserves; and with that soul all other growing souls will hasten to make themselves acquainted. Whitman comes to us\u2014perhaps not a discoverer, but certainly a grand interpreter. One-sided and all sided\u2014intense and indifferent\u2014lazy and lashed into fury-spouting words and pouring out streams of rubies and diamonds\u2014he is nothing more than the very child of nature, to whom accidentally has been given the name, WALT WHITMAN.</p>", "date": "June 2 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "Boston Banner of Light", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1860\u201361)].\" 2 June 1860.

But our attention is just now called to a little pamphlet-collection of notices of the previous editions of 'Leaves of Grass,' and by that we find that we have been forestalled in two instances. Had we known this we should have written otherwise; but as it is, we let our squib go. We admit that although there is no verse in Mr. Whitman's book, there is some poetry\u2014a little\u2014of an exquisite and peculiar cast, which flecks the surface of a very copious and strong expression of sympathy with and close observation of external nature. But the latter is not necessarily poetry, even when written by a poet of transcendant powers. Witness the description of the horse in Shakspeare's 'Venus and Adonis,' which is an enumeration of points better suited to Tattersall's books than to a work of fancy and imagination. As to these 'Leaves of Grass,' nine-tenths of them are covered with words that have no more meaning, coherency, or perceptible purpose than the columns in a spellingbook; while the indecency\u2014an indecency not born of prurience, but of the absolute refusal to recognize such a distinction as decent and indecent\u2014is monstrous beyond precedent, and were it not before our eyes, beyond belief. Yet for the one-tenth that we have excepted we shall keep the book, and read it, not without a strange interest in the man who could draw such a slender thread of truth and purity through such a confused mass of folly, feculence, and falsehood.</p><p>Messrs.

Thus, they allege, we refer to Cooper as 'The American Scott,' Emerson is Carlyle and water (and very muddy water, in the present writer's humble judgment), the North American Review is a poor copy of the Edinburgh, and so forth. But especially do they reproach us with a lack of originality in the poetical form of composition. There is fancy and sweetness and music, they admit, in our poets, but we can point to no one great poem on which is stamped the impression of a new and mighty continent, which is fragrant with the fresh odours of the unpruned-forest, whose rhythm, mighty in its movement as the wind rushing over the limitless prairie, bears the reader along unresistingly\u2014a poem, in short, full of the energy, the passion, the vim of large-veined, stout-breasted, hopeful, wide-awake, go-ahead Young America. But the reproach can be made no longer. We have an American poem. Several of them. Yes, sir. Also a great original representative mind. 'The hour and the man' have arrived, the man who knows what's o'clock and always comes up to time. The name of this wonderful poet is Walt Whitman, and his verdant volume of verse is called 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>Perhaps we are wrong in referring to these 'leaves' as verse. We used that term for want of a better one, and having in mind the definition of the master in the Bourgeois Gentilhomme\u2014Tout-ce qui n'est point prose est vers, et tout-ce qui n'est point vers est prose. Worthy Monsieur Jourdain was astonished, as Moli\u00e9re makes him confess, to discover that he had been speaking prose all his life without knowing it, but the master would have experienced a much greater degree of amazement, could he have seen his theory demolished by a poem like any one of these by Walt Whitman. Here is something which is neither prose nor verse, which writes itself out in long or short sentences, as the case may be, disdaining the shackles of rhyme or measure, and sounding to the ear alternately like the click of the instrument in the Telegraph office, the roar of Buttermilk Falls, the eloquence of the Razor-Strop man, the buzz of a wheat-machine, the braying of an ass, the cries of 'the boys' running to a big fire with No 40, the animated evening conversation in a Lager Bier Saloon, and a campaign speech in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Mr. Walt Whitman is to us, however, no 'new Nebuchadnezzar,' nor has the 'Leaves of Grass' been brought to our notice now for the first time. Five years ago we recollect to have seen the first edition of it, and to have made up our mind that if it did not proceed from a lunatic, it was designed as a solemn hoax upon the public. The extravagance of the style, the beastliness of the sentiments, the blatant blasphemy of the whole performance, its profanation of every tender and holy impulse, its frequent indecency of language, all suggested Bedlam. The bizarre appearance of the book also indicated a crazy origin. The page, about half the size of our own, was printed in type as large as that of a playbill, the presswork seemed to have been done with a sledgehammer, and the frontispiece was adorned with a full length portrait, in the finest steel engraving, of Walt Whitman, in which, without other garment than shirt and pantaloons, his sleeves rolled up and arms akimbo, he appeared to be doing his best to look like a rowdy and a vagabond, and with greater success, it must be admitted, than ordinarily falls to poor human endeavor.</p><p>After the lapse of a lustrum, not so long a time as was recommended by the Latin critic for keeping a poem before publication, the profane bestial rigmarole is again brought before the public, enlarged, altered and rendered, if possible, more disgusting and abominable than in its pristine shape. If the present edition had excited no more comment than the first, we should not have taken the trouble to refer to it. But it has been widely noticed and even applauded, an immense amount of advertising has been expended upon it by the publishers, and there is danger that it may find its way into respectable bookstores and even pure households, by reason of the attention it has received. To save the latter from moral contamination and the necessity of using disinfectants, we feel bound to say so much by way of caution as will enable them to learn the true character of the volume. Not that we would pollute our columns with quoting any of its vilest passages. It will suffice, we hope, to say that Walt Whitman glories in materialism of the most degraded kind, that the animal passions call forth his loftiest admiration, and that man as a brute, in his earthly relation to the beasts that perish, not in his kinship to immortal beings, is the object of that faculty which in the Walt Whitman organization takes the place of reverence. Not only is he without the means of discriminating between the pure and the impure, but the Chevalier Bayard is no more to him than a chicken cock, Tennyson is no higher in the scale of created things than a tadpole, and he can perceive no difference between Bacon and a Berkshire pig.</p><p>And yet all this is mixed up with constant references to the soul, of which he assumes to be an interpreter.

It is very much discussed and criticized, and is indeed a singular production. Distinguished by power of a certain sort, by bursts of originality, by occasional undoubted cleverness, it is also disfigured by the most disgusting beastiality we remember ever to have seen in print; a beastiality which is the most prominent feature of the book, which is utterly animal, and so marked that it not only gives tone to the work, but indicates the character of the writer. Vigorous, coarse, vulgar, indecent, powerful, like a great strong, filthy bull, delighting alike in his size and his strength, and his filth; full of egotism, rampant, but not insufferable, fully believing himself to be a representative man and poet of the American people; persuaded that he is the great poet whose advent the world is waiting for, and that his errand is to sing his own individuality, his own peculiarities, whether physical or spiritual, but particularly physical; his own idiosyncracies, whether little or great; his own characteristics, whether noble or mean; and all these not so much because they are his individualities and characteristics and idiosyncracries , as because he thinks they typify those of other Americans\u2014this is Walt Whitman's character and notions, as they seems to be developed in his Leaves of Grass. The measure in which he writes is his own, and is often no measure at all, but a sort of alliteratives style, with a certain rough music in it; his style is outside of all rules, transgresses, grammar and rhetoric, it jumbles up slang and vulgarity with choice language, huddles together English and scraps of French and Latin and Spanish in the absurdest fashion, and yet at times has a certain terseness that is telling. The book is, in many respects abominable; in many respects the maddest folly and the merest balderdash that ever was written; but it unfortunately possesses these streaks of talent, these grains of originality, which will probably preserve the author from oblivion. We should advise nobody to read it unless he were curious in literary monstrosities, and had a stomach capable of digesting the coarsest stuff ever offered by caterers for the reading public, and yet those who are catholic enough to appreciate two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff, will not be uninterested in the volume.</p>", "date": "June 9 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "Walt Whitman", "publication": "New York Day Book", "citation": "Whitman, Walt [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1860\u201361)].\" 9 June 1860.

In his refusal to recognise such distractions as 'decent and indecent' in the human structure\u2014though, in the opinion of another critic, this is 'monstrous beyond precedent'\u2014I see the sweetest simplicity and child-like innocence. More than that, I see the purity of the heart maintained spite of all the strong impulses of youth, spite of the hush and whisper and taboo of an age of virtuous prostitution, until the equipoise of mature life, the wisdom gained by experience, informs his mind and dictates his words. In childhood there is no blush of shame at sight of a nude form, and the serene wisdom of maturity covers this innocence with a hale of glory, by recognising the divinity of humanity, and perceiving the unity of all the functions of the human body, and the inevitable tendency to harmonic adjustment and adaptation. As all of nature's forms are evolved from the same God-origin or substance, though there may be differences of rank, there can be no difference in essence; and those functions which have been deemed the most brutal and degrading, will be found to be first in rank when nature's hierarchy shall be established and observed. A true delicacy will neither emblason the individual act of communion abroad (as, sanctioned by custom, those who lay claim to the highest refinement do daily), nor blush to a crimson when the poet of sexual purity vindicates manhood and womanhood from the charge of infamy, degradation, and vice, on account of growth and development after the order of nature.

[Review]</p><p>BY ADAH ISAACS MENKEN HEENAN.</p><p>Swimming against the current is hard and dangerous work.</p><p>Strong, firm, and iron bound must be the noble vessel; brave and fearless must be the hearts that stand at the helm. 'God and our right' must be the pass-word of those who lift their sails to stem the current.</p><p>Individuality of intellect and an affinity with God\u2014not society\u2014powerful energy, a potent buoyancy, and a strong volition can and will venture the task. Cowardice is the demonstration of weakness. Strength and valor must exert themselves in valorous actions. Courage is the true demonstration of strength. And whoever is gifted with that mental and moral god-power, to stand like a rock in the midst of a roaring storm, feels the mighty impulse to oppose the impetuous billows of the rushing current\u2014dare the storm\u2014stem the tide, will reach the goal, gain eternal life, for they are God's children of inspiration!</p><p>But few, oh! too few, possess these holy attributes, to bear them up against wind and wave. Therefore, the vast majority of mankind intrust themselves with so much ease and convenience to the current of popular sentiments, fashions, weak, driveling notions, idiotic principles: plying, now and then, a little with the useless rudder of their intellect, they swim lazily along with the current; flattering the ambition and passions of the influential and great men, worshiping the idols of the day, to suit prevalent notions, taking every advantage of the weak, and infirm, they swim down the current of life, and arrive quietly and conveniently into the harbor of Death.</p><p>Swimming against the current is hard and dangerous work! How few are the brave souls that are to-day stemming the tide! Seward, Jefferson Davis, Sumner, Lovejoy, Wendell Phillips, Beecher, Theodore Parker, Garrison, Walter Whitman, Mrs. Hatch, and perhaps some few more. There they stand, in the midst of inhumanity, few and far apart, like the islands of the ocean, fertile and fresh as the cases of the desert, 'their shoulders and upward higher than all the people,' as the mountains range and overtower the plains and valleys below.</p><p>There they stand with their spontaneous and generous impulses, the internal ear and eye of humanity, that sees and grasps instinctive eagerness at the faults and corruptions of men, things, religions, and institutions around them.</p><p>They have braved the current, for they hear the divine voice of inspiration calling, 'Whom shall I send to the rescue?' And they could not help responding, 'Here I am\u2014send me!'</p><p>But alas! they swim against the current, and laborious and tiresome is the task. Many a foaming wave rushes at their heads, and renders them almost helpless for awhile; but they recover, and swim on, God bless them!</p><p>Sometimes overcome by the strong battle of the waves, a fainting soul pauses for rest; he looks down the stream, and sees thousands of pleasure-boats moving smoothly with the current, and rocking softly the rich, gay, happy, and successful passengers. He hesitates. 'Shall I join them? Shall I blot out God's voice that calls me?' he asks. No , he cannot resist that holy voice. Onward is his course\u2014he must swim again.</p><p>Look at Walter Whitman, the American philosopher who is centuries ahead of his contemporaries, who, in smiling carelessness, analyzes the elements of which society is composed, compares them with the history of past events, and ascertains the results which the same causes always produced, and must produce. Thus [one line of newspaper text illegible]. He hears the Divine voice calling him to caution mankind against this or that evil, and wields his pen, exerts his energies, for the cause of liberty and humanity!</p><p>But he is too far ahead of his contemporaries; they cannot comprehend him yet; he swims against the stream and finds me company. The passengers, in their floating boats, call him a fanatic, a visionary, a demagogue, a good-natured fool, etc., etc. Still he heeds them not: his mental conviction will not permit him to heed them.</p><p>Thousands of philosophers, poets, senators, preachers of God, philanthropists, friends and saviors of liberty, women of inspiration, men of reform, have been drowned in the current of life, because they swam against the stream\u2014died with the deep-seated pain in their breasts, poisoned with disappointment, insult, or ridicule, or starved to death by an ungrateful people\u2014poor Edgar A. Poe, for example. But when in the next century their words and schemes will become understood, because circumstances will take that turn which they predicted, marble statutes will be erected over the remains of him whom they suffered to starve, because he swam against the current.</p><p>Suppose all men would yield to the current of the age? None would manfully uncover the rotten spots, expose the errors and prejudices entertained, and the evils practiced. Would not humanity soon be degraded into a reckless pleasure-party, skipping around, and approaching always nearer the yawning whirlpool, until finally the whole boat would rush in.</p><p>Yes! those men who have the valor and moral courage to swim against the current, are the noble and generous towers of humanity. Yet we ignore and contradict them; yet they are, nevertheless, the Messiahs of humanity. Mankind is obliged to them for new ideas, periodical regeneration, and the progress of civilization. They combat with the waves, and are frequently buried beneath them; but after centuries, they are rescued from the aqueous grave, and rise to perpetual glory!</p><p>If there is any truth in the above\u2014and close observation of facts prove that there is\u2014it is also morally certain that thus Israel will rise to perpetual glory! So the house of Jacob will be rescued from the grave, and a proud monument assigned us in the history of the world. So Judea will triumph, after darkness and ignorance will be utterly dispelled by the radiant sun of divine truth! For thus Israel has swam against the current for thirty centuries and more! Thus it has struggled and combated against the corruptions of all ages in history; Thus is Israel the savior, the Messiah of the nations!</p><p>Israel swam against the current when heathenism reigned supreme, when Grecian philosophy undermined the ancient superstructure of religion, when Epicure's doctrines demoralized Rome, and heathenism gave way before Christianity and the Islam. It swam against the current of popular religions in all periods of history; and does it yet, with the same energy and unabated vigor. Buried under waves of popular prejudices, it always resurrects again in youthful strength, valor, and glory of eternal life!</p><p>'Hail thee, Israel, who is like unto thee? a people saved by God, the shield of thy salvation and the sword of thy pride!'</p>", "date": "June 10 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "Adah Isaacs Menken Heenan", "publication": "The Sunday Mercury", "citation": "Heenan, Adah Isaacs Menken. \"Swimming Against the Current.\" 10 June 1860.

Recently the writer has appeared in a large volume, (published in the puritanical and transcendental city of Boston, by Thayer & Eldridge, who we hope are willing to stand the notoriety of it,) and a more scandalous volume we never saw. We had not intended to notice it, but certain of the soft heads, on the shoulders of men and women indiscriminately, have conceived that it is a pure book. In the last number of the New York Saturday Press, Mary A. Chilton gives her ideas of Walt Whitman's poetry generally, and especially of his smut; and to show the public how far into degradation certain new lights are ready to be led, we quote a portion of her letter, simply italicising such sentences as we wish to call special attention to:\u2014</p><p>'In childhood there is no blush of shame at sight of a nude form, and the serene wisdom of maturity covers this innocence with a halo of glory, by recognizing the divinity of humanity, and perceiving the unity of all the functions of the human body, and the inevitable tendency to harmonic adjustment and adaptation.

Of course those who assert the doctrine of total depravity must find some part of the person too vile to think of, and will be shocked to hear another express unqualified admiration for the human body and the human soul.'</p><p>A professedly obscene book carries with it its own condemnation among decent people, and finds its own market among the vicious and unclean. Besides, there are laws against its promulgation; and appeal can be made to them if it is openly exposed for sale, or advertised, or sold more secretly. This literature is not unfrequently stuck in one's face at steamboat landings by lousy scoundrels who peddle filth for a living, but one can always cry 'police' if he will, and stop it. Here, however, is a book with many respectable associations\u2014respectable publishers\u2014the author a writer for the Atlantic Monthly\u2014'for sale everywhere' on respectable book-shelves\u2014in very respectable type and binding\u2014advertised in respectable papers\u2014and yet it has page after page that no man could read aloud to a decent assembly without being hooted out of it, and that could not be published in the columns of a daily newspaper without disgusting and outraging a virtuous community. The dangers of the book lie in its claiming to be a respectable book\u2014in its claiming to be a pure book, and in the fact that there are lecherous fools enough in the world to allow this claim, if not to maintain it. We are inclined to think that the author considers the book a pure one. It costs some charity to admit this, and a large allowance for eccentricity of mind and temperament; but, making the admission, we are at liberty to comment on that phase of infidelity of which it is the outgrowth.</p><p>Nothing is more notorious than the fact that when any individual claims to have some light superior to that revealed in the Bible, whether that light be the 'light of nature,' simply, or the light of new and direct revelation or inspiration, then that individual almost invariably develops himself towards libertinism. Perhaps this fact is more notorious when we find men in masses, as in the various sects that spring up from time to time. William Dorrel who, seventy-five years ago, proclaimed himself the Messiah up in Franklin county, counseled promiscuous intercourse of the sexes and taught as vile stuff as our very natural poet Walt Whitman does now. The Mormons, with their new Bible, ran straight into the most disgusting polygamy; and Heber Kimball talks in the most promiscuous congregation of the saints as easily and freely of his 'cows,' as our 'poet of sexual purity' does of women. Spiritualism, whenever it has cut loose from the Bible as the only authoritative revelation from heaven, has gone just as naturally into free-love as water runs down hill. The very first social institution that falls into contempt after Christianity as a revelation is discarded, is Christian marriage, and of all the 'teachings' in the world, we know of none that so inevitably lead to impurity as those attributed to 'Nature.'</p><p>Now Walt Whitman is par excellence the 'poet of nature.' In his pure taste there is nothing unclean, because nothing seems unclean. Nature has free course in him, and runs and is glorified in all its issues. Those passions which degrade men and lead to nine-tenths of the crime of the world, he exalts. Those appetites which only a pure, true and life-long love can hallow, are with him appetites to be cherished and fed\u2014no matter about the love. It ought to be enough for Walt Whitman, if he honestly thinks his book a pure one, to know that the pure in society will shun it, and that it will be sought out and laughed over by lewd women and prurient boys and hoary-headed old lechers,\u2014to know that this notice of his volume will stir to read it only the dregs of the social and moral world into which it goes. That settles the question. When men and women are led by their higher affinities, they will be led straight away from Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.'

We may not be Spartans;\u2014it seems the prayer of Whitman that we may not degenerate into Sybarites, and to prevent this he uses the crash-towel of bold words.</p><p>America must make her distinctive mark. Already over our Past falls the bridal-veil of Romance, wedding it to the Future, though its thin cloud, its exquisite beauty and loveliness seem more bewitching than when it was our Present. In the Revolution of 1776 lie undelivered the subjects for a thousand poems to which the Iliad of Homer will be but as a rushlight to a conflagration. To the glories of our Past and the beauty of our Present, Walt Whitman awakes us; rough, bold, and free, he bursts out in the roaring old song that might have cheered the Old Continentals bivouacked for battle. And the words will thrill many a heart even in our day, clad though the body may be in homespun in far Western homes; grimmed [sic] though it may be by coal-dust and machinery, or wearing out life toiling away where brown earth, blue skies, pure air, green fields, and all God's gifts to man are driven ruthlessly aside that we may give more room for Mammon.</p><p>Before we condemn the book, let us read it. Before we cry out 'Eccentricity!' let us investigate our own centre, and the teapot we are making such a tempest in.

Editors:\u2014I do not ask a place for this letter in your columns because I feel that Mr. Whitman's poems need any justification; they justify themselves, and I have full faith that they will continue to do so long after the swarm of attacking critics are gone; nor do I hope to give more generous or appreciative praise to Leaves of Grass than you have given in your notice of the work, but because, being a woman, and having read the uncharitable and bitter attacks upon the book, I wish to give my own view of it.</p><p>I have read it carefully, and in reading, have found no page which made me blush, and no sentiment which might not be expressed by a pure man.</p><p>In humanity or art I consider that coarse and licentious wherein the soul is made subservient to the body. I am not shocked when I read the stories of the Old Testament: I see behind the apparently gross form, great meanings. Yet I find in the novels and the versification of modern literature, a subtle sensuality which, under the semblance of virtue, destroys all that is pure and elevated in the mind, leaving it enslaved by sensation and petty circumstance.</p><p>In Mr. Whitman's poetry, I see a breadth of view which overlooks distinctions. To him, nothing is base when used for a great purpose; he makes all things subservient to thought, and thus dignifies by his touch.</p><p>I find there an admirable courage. While we truckle to our bodies, trying to cheat ourselves and one another into oblivion of the potent physical facts, while we feed with exciting novels and amorous poetry those passions we dare not own, we are shocked, for sooth, when a great, earnest, sorrowful man gives us the facts which, gilded over with poor art, we accept readily enough: and when, with manly courage, he owns that he has sinned with prostitutes and felons, (and who has not?) we despise him. Was it not Christ who said of old, 'Let him who is without blame among you cast the first stone'?</p><p>I find in these poems great ideas, large, cheerful, healthy views of life. No sentimentality, no weak or misplaced passion, but a wisdom which looks through all, behind all, beyond all, which sees the tendency of things, and rests content that all is well. I find a reverence so great and tender as not to despise the meanest thing, knowing that Nature has fashioned everything through ages of patient toil; a reverence which sees in the mud and slime of the pond the same fitness and beauty as in the dainty lily floating above it; which holds the 'woman just as great as the man;' and a mother. 'The melodious character of the earth, the finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go;' a reverence which recognizes in the distinction of sex, that great principle which asserts itself from the lowest to the highest forms of vegetable and animal life, a mystery equally holy with the mystery of birth, the mystery of death.</p><p>I find there a generosity, giving without stint. Nothing is too precious, nothing too great, nothing too holy to be bestowed. The experiences which most men in their selfishness hug close, which they call 'too sacred for the eyes of the world,' Mr. Whitman, like a true poet, deals out largely.</p><p>And I find more than all these: I find a wonderful knowledge of history, of philosophy, of mythology, of language, of mechanics and geography, of the customs of all peoples at all times; a knowledge which could have been acquired only by hard and long-continued study.</p><p>I find the highest artistic merits. A measure at once original and melodious, into which the words form themselves so naturally that we forget it is measure, and are awake of the thought alone. It is like the sound of the wind or the sea, a fitting measure for the first distinctive American bard who speaks for our large-scaled nature, for the red men who are gone, for our vigorous young population.</p><p>Yet grand, wild, free, and natural, as is Mr. Whitman's poetry, it is not careless or hap-hazard, anymore than Niagara, the Mississippi, the prairies, or the great Western cities, are hap-hazard; it is the result of patient labor, of intense thought; for it is the highest art which most closely imitates nature. Here we see not only boldness of conception, but finish of detail. What is there so graphic in the English language that Mr. Whitman should be ashamed to place beside it the pictures of the 'Fall of Alamo,' 'The Mashed Fireman,' 'The Sinking Ship,' or any other of the hundreds of pictures scattered throughout the book. What so exquisitely delicate as to eclipse 'A Word out of the Sea.'</p><p>There are few poems which I can read with so intense a thrill of exultation at the greatness of my destiny, at the exquisite harmony and balance of the universe, at the boundless love brooding over mankind; that fill me with so strong a faith in the working together of all things for good, so great forbearance toward error\u2014yet nerve me so resolutely to action, as these poems of Walt Whitman.</p><p>C.

Among American authors there is one named Walt Whitman, who, in 1855, first issued a small quarto volume of ninety-five pages, under the title of 'Leaves of Grass'. In appearance and mode of publication it was an oddity, this same small volume, which, it appears, the author had printed himself, and then 'left to the winds of heaven to publish.' By the booksellers of the United States generally the book was ignored, but it could be obtained by the persevering applicant. Walt Whitman was then about thirty-six years of age, a native of Long Island, born on the hills about thirty miles from the greatest American city, and brought up in Brooklyn and in New York. Mr. R. W. Emerson, it seems, recognized the first issue of the Leaves and hastened to welcome the author, then totally unknown. Among other things, said Emerson to the new avatar, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a start.This last clause was, however, overlooked entirely by the critics, who treated the new author as one self-educated, yet in the rough, unpolished, and owing nothing to instruction. Fudge! The authority for so treating the author was derived from himself, who thus described, in one of his poems, his person, character, and name, having omitted the last from his title-page:\u2014</p><p>'WALT WHITMAN, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos, <br>Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual;'</p><p>and in various other passages confessed to all the vices, as well as the virtues of man. All this, with intentional wrong-headedness, was attributed by the sapient reviewers to the individual writer, and not to the subjective-hero supposed to be writing. Notwithstanding the word 'Kosmos,' the writer was taken to be an ignorant man. Emerson perceived at once that there had been 'a long foreground somewhere' or somehow\u2014not so they. Every page teems with knowledge, with information,\u2014but they saw it not, because it did not answer their purpose to see it.</p><p>The poem in which the word Kosmos appears explains in fact the whole mystery\u2014nay the word itself explains it. The poem is nominally upon himself, but really includes everybody. It begins,</p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>In a word Walt Whitman represents the Kosmical Man\u2014he is the Adamus of the 19th century\u2014not an Individual, but mankind. As such, in celebrating himself, he proceeds to celebrate universal humanity in its attributes, and accordingly commences his dithyramb with the five senses, beginning with that of smell. Afterwards, he deals with the intellectual, rational, and moral powers; showing throughout his treatment an intimate acquaintance with Kant's transcendental method, and perhaps including in his development the whole of the German school, down to Hegel; at any rate as interpreted by Cousin and others in France, and Emerson in the United States. He certainly includes Fichte, for he mentions the Egotist as the only true philosopher; and consistently identifies himself not only with every man, but with the Universe and its Maker;\u2014and it is in doing so that the strength of his description consists. It is from such an ideal elevation that he looks down on Good and Evil, regards them as equal, and extends to them the like measure of equity.</p><p>Instead therefore of regarding these 'Leaves of Grass' as a marvel, they seem to us as the most natural product of the American soil. They are certainly filled with an American spirit, breathe the American air, and assert the fullest American freedom. Nay it may be said also that they assert the fullest Yankee license. Respecting the latter feature, his American puffers, in the disguise of critics, charge the author with irreligion and indecency; and these charges are unblushingly reprinted by his publishers, among the critical recommendations of his performances, as if thereby they would attract a numerous class of prurient readers.</p><p>All this is undoubtedly an unworthy trade-trick, to be thoroughly denounced, condemned, and punished. That class of readers, however, will be disappointed, as the passages intended are only so many instances adduced in support of a philosophical principle; not meant for obscenity, but for scientific examples, introduced as they might be in any legal, medical, or physiological book, for the purpose of instruction. They chiefly relate to the sense of touch, and might be found in substance in any Cyclopedic article on the specific topic.</p><p>So much for the matter of the book. As to the manner, it is the same as that with which Mr. Martin Tupper has made us familiar in his 'Proverbial Philosophy,' and Mr. Warren in his 'Lily and the Bee.' There is nothing that we can see miraculous in such an imitation. The result is a rhapsody, somewhat Oriental in appearance, prose in form, but rhythmical in its effect on the ear, producing a disjointed impression, such as might be produced by a bold prose-translation of Klopstock's famous odes, which would then present so many unconnected assertions, expressed in extravagant diction. The style of the work is therefore anything but attractive\u2014calculated rather to puzzle than to please. It is however, as a printed book, got up in a splendid manner, and is electrotyped for the sake of cheapness, the publishers evidently designing to sell it by millions, if possible.</p><p>Notwithstanding all its drawbacks, we have little hesitation in saying that they will probably succeed,\u2014on the principle, perhaps, of the quack, who calculated there were many more fools than wise men in the world. No matter, if the fools are all made wise, by the perusal of these 'Leaves.' They may be; it is not utterly impossible; but we doubt it.</p>", "date": "June 30 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Leader and Saturday Analyst", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman And His Critics.\" 30 June 1860.

On that occasion we were spared the trouble of setting forth the new poet's merits, as he or his publisher was good enough to paste into his presentation-copy a number of criticisms from American periodicals, which we were satisfied to reprint along with a few extracts illustrative of the volume they recommended. We cannot treat a new edition of Leaves of Grass in the same way. It is, we believe, the sixth or seventh which has appeared in the United States, and shows, both externally and internally, that Mr. Whitman is now much too confident in his own popularity and influence to care for directing English reviewers in the way they should go. The volume itself is splendid. The type is magnificent, the paper is as thick as cardboard, and the covers, ornamented with an intaglio of the earth moving through space and displaying only the American hemisphere, are almost as massive as the house-tiles which, according to Mr. Gladstone, are produceable from rags boiled to pulp. It is a book evidently intended to lie on the tables of the wealthy. No poor man could afford it, and it is too bulky for its possessor to get it into his pocket or to hide it away in a corner.</p><p>This is simply astonishing to us, for Mr. Whitman reappears with all his characteristics. He is still</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding;<br>No sentimentalist\u2014no stander above men or women or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest\u2014</p><p>in short, one of the most indecent writers who ever raked out filth into sentences. Such books as this have occasionally been printed in the guise of a</p><p>scrofulous French novel,<br>On grey paper with blunt type,</p><p>but this, we verily believe, is the first time that one of them has been decorated with all the art of the binder and the pressman. The odd thing is, that it irresistibly suggests its being intended for the luxurious and cultivated of both sexes. We are almost ashamed to ask the question\u2014but do American ladies read Mr. Whitman? At all events, it is startling to find such a poet acquiring popularity in the country where piano-legs wear frilled trousers, where slices are cut from turkeys' bosoms, and where the male of the gallinaceous tribe is called a 'rooster.' The theory that the affectation of an artistic object will justify any conceivable mode of treatment has never been carried farther.</p><p>Poetry of so singular a kind deserves some degree of analysis. Mr. Whitman's first characteristic is, that he is an Emersonian. It is curious to observe the effect of the secondary Carlylism of Emerson on a thorough American rowdy. It is generally the weak through over-refinement who are imposed on by that philosophy which pre-eminently affects to disdain conventionalities; but here is a 'disorderly, fleshy, sensual' nature, which takes the disease in quite a new form. Mr. Whitman is a professed Pantheist, but he draws from his Pantheism some conclusions not dreamed of by his teachers. From the principle that all things are divine, he derives the inference that all things are equally beautiful and equally fitted for poetical treatment, and this is his justification for writing with the utmost minuteness on subjects on which Nature herself has sometimes been thought to command silence to everybody except doctors. Mr. Whitman's philosophy seems also to deny that man has any personality distinct from the rest of the universe. A very large part of his poetry is taken up with assertions that he is everything else, and everything else is he; nor do we remember to have come across a doctrine more convenient for a poet. It relieves one from the necessity of doing more than enumerating the various elements of which the moral and material worlds are composed, the various scenes of which they are the theatre, or the various passions they include, and then the enumeration may be closed with the remark that all these things are equally godlike, or are equally dear to the poet, or are equally part of him, or have an equal claim on him as a part of themselves. We take, almost at random, the following passage, to give a notion of Emersonianism done into verse by Mr. Whitman:\u2014</p><p>Good in all,<br>In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,<br>In the annual return of the seasons,<br>In the hilarity of youth;<br>In the strength and flush of manhood,<br>In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,<br>In the superb vistas of Death.</p><p>Wonderful to depart!<br>Wonderful to be here!<br>The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood,<br>To breathe the air, how delicious!<br>To speak! to walk! to seize something by the hand!<br>To prepare for sleep, for bed\u2014to look on my rose-coloured flesh,<br>To be conscious of my body, so amorous, so large.<br>To be this incredible God I am,<br>To have gone forth among other Gods\u2014those men and women I love.</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>I sing the Equalities,<br>I sing the endless finales of things,<br>I say Nature continues\u2014Glory continues,<br>I praise with electric voice,<br>For I do not see one imperfection in the universe,<br>And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe.</p><p>These lines will show that Mr. Whitman has adopted a metre which, like his philosophy, is calculated to make the labour of writing poetry much slighter than it has been usually considered. He has a better ear than Mr. Tupper,1 and his versification has occasionally a vague rhythm about it, but it is evidently the free and easy Tupperian pseud-hexameter which he has taken for his model. The elasticity of the rules by which this peculiar metre is governed here and there receives startling illustration in Leaves of Grass, as in the last two verses of the following extract:\u2014</p><p>Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing in America?<br>Have you studied out MY LAND, its idioms and men?<br>Have you learned the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography, pride, <br>freedom, friendship, of my land? its substratums and objects?<br>Have you considered the organic compact of the first day of the first year <br>of the independence of The States, signed by the Commissioners,<br> ratified by The States, and read by Washington at the head of the <br>army?</p><p>The same metrical oddities appear in another passage, which we quote because it gives us Mr. Whitman's description\u2014doubtless a faithful one\u2014of himself and his habits:\u2014</p><p>His shape arises,<br>Arrogant, masculine, n\u00e4ive, rowdyish,<br>Laugher, weeper, worker, idler, citizen, countryman,<br>Saunterer of woods, stander upon hills, summer swimmer in rivers or by <br>the sea,<br>Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from <br>taint from top to toe, free forever from headache and dyspepsia,<br> clean-breathed,<br>Ample-limbed, a good feeder, weight a hundred and eighty pounds, full-<br> blooded, six feet high, forty inches round the breast and back,<br>Countenance sun-burnt, bearded, calm, unrefined,<br>Reminder of animals, meeter of savage and gentleman on terms,</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>Never offering others, always offering himself, corroborating his phre-<br>nology,<br>Voluptuous, inhabitive, combative, conscientious, alimentive, intuitive, <br>of copious friendship, sublimity, firmness, self-esteem, comparison, <br>individuality, form, locality, eventuality,<br>Avowing by life, manners, works, to contribute illustrations of results of <br>The States,<br>Teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely, egotism,<br>Inviter of others continually henceforth to try their strength against his.</p><p>It will be seen that Mr. Whitman calls himself 'n\u00e4ive,' in the feminine. One of his peculiarities is that he mixes up French words, generally much misspelt and otherwise abused, with the English or American of his verses. In one poem, each stanza begins with 'Allons.' In another, the words 'Accouche; accouchez' form a whole line; and elsewhere he calls upon the world to 'respondez.' But if his French is a new ingredient in poetry, still newer is his American slang, particularly journalistic and debating slang, with which he sometimes fills entire pages. Nothing can be absurder than the way in which the commonplaces of public speaking are occasionally intruded, as in this couplet:\u2014</p><p>I say, nourish a great intellect, a great brain;<br>If I have said anything to the contrary, I hereby retract it.</p><p>Or in the following:\u2014</p><p>I, an habitu\u00e9 of the Alleghenies, treat man as he is in the influences of <br>Nature, in himself, in his inalienable rights.<br>I do not tell the usual facts, proved by records and documents;<br>What I tell (talking to every born American) requires no further proof <br>than he or she who hears me will furnish, by silently meditating <br>alone.</p><p>The extracts we have given will perhaps lead the reader to wonder by what extraordinary hallucination as to the character of poetry Americans have been led to regard Mr. Whitman as a poet. Yet we are far from saying that he has nothing of the poetical fibre. He is certainly an unredeemed New York rowdy of the lowest stamp. He is absolutely without sense of decency. He has obviously no sort of acquaintance with the masters of his art, and his studies have been apparently confined to Mr. Tupper, his news-paper, and the semi-lyrical rhapsodies of the Boston transcendentalists. But his taste, now hopelessly perverted, seems to have been naturally delicate, and he has a very vivid imagination. When his pictures happen (as is rarely the case) to be neither befouled with filth nor defaced by vulgarity, they are, for the most part, strikingly presented. A sort of catalogue of scenes of American life, which, according to Mr. Whitman's easy method, is continued for half-a-dozen pages and results in nothing particular, gives a good idea of his descriptive power. We can only quote the beginning:\u2014</p><p>Over the growing sugar\u2014over the cotton plant\u2014over the rice in its low <br>moist field,<br>Over the sharp-peaked farm house, with its scalloped scum and slender <br>shoots from the gutters,<br>Over the western persimmon\u2014over the long-leaved corn\u2014over the deli-<br>cate blue-flowered flax,<br>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with <br>the rest,<br>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze,<br>Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low <br>scragged limbs,<br>Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the <br>brush,<br>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,<br>Where the bat flies in the Seventh Month eve\u2014Where the great gold- <br>bug drops through the dark,<br>Where the flails keep time on the barn floor,<br>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the <br>meadow,<br>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering <br>of their hides,<br>Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen\u2014Where andirons straddle <br>the hearth-slab- Where cob-webs fall in festoons from the rafters,<br>Where trip-hammers crash\u2014Where the press is whirling its cylinders,<br>Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes out of its ribs\u2014</p><p>there, and everywhere else, is Mr. Whitman.</p><p>We conclude with some lines which are more like true poetry than anything else in the volume. They are fished out from the very midst of a sea of foul impurities:\u2014</p><p>Press close, bare-bosomed Night Press close, magnetic, nourishing <br>Night!<br>Night of south winds! Night of the large few stars!<br>Still, nodding night! Mad, naked, summer night.<br>Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breathed Earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset!

But 'leaves'\u2014which, we take it, is the Transatlantic for blades\u2014'of grass' have nothing of irreligion or indecency about them. Mr. Walt Whitman\u2014for it is with that choice spirit we are now dealing\u2014might as well let them alone.</p><p>It is, for reasons we shall presently specify, rather a difficult matter to give the class of readers for whom we write, any adequate notion of this remarkable volume. Let them, however, imagine a Mormon, a medical student, and Miss Eugenie Plummer combining to draw up a treatise in the style of 'Proverbial Philosophy,' and they will have a faint idea of the last production of Mr. Walt Whitman.</p><p>The folly of the work is its least defect.

Doubtless Mr. Walt Whitman imagines he is writing like a madman, when, as a matter of fact, he is only writing like Nat Lee's friend.</p><p>He tells us that the world is not devout enough\u2014that he understands 'Him who was crucified;' and in general tries to impress upon us that he is an apostle of no mean pretensions. But his creed, so far as we understand it, consists in a peculiarly coarse materialism. He tells us pretty roundly that he worships his own body, and people who would like to learn a great number of particulars about Mr. Walt Whitman's body, may find them in Mr. Walt Whitman's book.</p><p>Throughout the work there is a tone of consistent impurity which reaches its climax in some compositions entitled 'Enfans d'Adam'\u2014a designation which we can only explain by imagining it to contain some allusion to the Adamites, of which interesting, though as we had supposed, extinct sect, Mr. Walt Whitman is a very fair representative. For the downright foulness of some of these passages we do not believe that a parallel could be found even by ransacking the worst classical poets from Aristophanes to Ausonius, and we are rather surprised that with John Lord Campbell on the woolsack, and a certain act of his still unrepealed on the statute-book, Mr. Walt Whitman should have found a London vendor for his uncleanly work.</p><p>This is more decided language than we generally employ, and our readers may ask us for some justification of it. Let us remind them of Lord Macaulay's description of Wycherley, which we can certainly apply to Walt Whitman. 'His indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against the hunters. It is safe because it is too filthy to handle, and too noisome even to approach.' There are certain criminals whom even literary judges must try with closed doors, and our readers must deduce from our verdict that 'the evidence is unfit for publication.' We say, then, deliberately, that of all the writers we have ever perused, Mr. Walt Whitman is the most silly, the most blasphemous, and the most disgusting; if we can think of any stronger epithets, we will print them in a second edition.</p>", "date": "July 7 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Literary Gazette", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Leaves of Grass.\" 7 July 1860.

She may have an emperor sooner\u2014ubsit omen! Young as she is, the land of the stars and stripes has within her plenty of the stuff of which emperors can be made; but poets are a choicer growth, and need more years than the Union numbers from its birth to acclimatize their race in a new country. Of the few poets born in America, not one is distinctively American in his poetry; all are exotics, and their roots are nurtured by pabulum imported from the old country. In process of time, the foreign stock will accommodate itself to the new conditions by which it is surrounded; it will gradually undergo a transformation of species and become racy of the soil, but the soil itself must meanwhile pass through a corresponding change. It is still too crude; there is in it, as Oliver Wendell Holmes avows, 'no sufficient flavour of humanity,' such as inheres in every inch of ground belonging to some of the ancient seats of civilization. These truths are plainly discerned by the most cultivated minds in the States, and by them only; others believe that a great poet has actually arisen amongst them, and they hail his appearance with the more rapture because there has certainly never been anything like him in the guise of a poet since the world began. In the year 1855, this prodigy, this 'compound of the New England transcendentalist and the New York rowdy,' as a friendly critic calls him with literal truth, put forth the first issue of his 'Leaves of Grass'\u2014videlicet Scurvy grass\u2014twelve poems, or rather bundles, in ninety-five pages, small quarto. The book was immediately pronounced by Ralph Waldo Emerson to be 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' Other critics followed suit, and Walt Whitman became as famous as the author of the Book of Mormon. A second edition of his 'Leaves of Grass,' with twenty additional bundles, making together 384 pages, was published within a year after the first; and now there lies before us a new, enlarged, and glorified edition, for which the publishers 'confidently claim recognition as one of the finest specimens of modern book-making.' The paper, print, and binding are indeed superb; but one thing these gentlemen have forgotten: where are the phallic emblems, and the figures of Priapus and the Satyrs that should have adorned the covers and the pages of this new gospel of lewdness and obscenity? Its frontispiece should have been, not the head and shoulders of the author, but a full-length portrait drawn as he loves to depict himself in his 'poems'\u2014naked as an Anabaptist of Munster,1 or making love like Diogenes coram populo\u2014with his own lines for inscription:\u2014</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding,<br>No sentimentalist\u2014no stander above men and women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>Arrogant, masculine, na\u00efve, rowdyish,<br>Laugher, weeper, worker, idler, citizen, countryman,<br>Saunterer of the woods, stander upon hills, summer swimmer in rivers or<br> by the sea,<br>Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from<br> taint from top to toe, free for ever from headache and dyspepsia,<br> clean-breathed,<br>Ample limbed, a good feeder, weight a hundred and eighty pounds,<br> full-blooded, six feet high, forty inches round the breast and back,</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>Countenance sunburnt, bearded, calm, unrefined,<br>Reminder of animals, meeter of savage and gentleman on equal terms.<br>Never offering others, always offering himself, corroborating his phrenology,<br>Voluptuous, inhabitive, combative, conscientious, alimentive, intuitive, <br>of copious friendship, firmness, self esteem, comparison, individuality, <br>form, locality, eventuality.<br>Avowing by life, manners, works, to contribute illustrations of the results <br>of the States,<br>Teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely, egotism,<br>Inviter of others continually henceforth to try their strength against his.</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed\u2014I too am untranslatable,<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>Such is the man, and such the sort of poetry, which have inaugurated 'an athletic and defiant literature,' destined, it is said, to supersede for the great republic the effete theories and forms that still amuse the senile decrepitude of the old country. Vast beyond comparison are the immunities enjoyed by the new school of poetry; it needs no intellectual capital to work with, disdains all submission to the laws of art as well as to the restraints of common decency, and may yawp away to its heart's content, never bothering itself about such trifles as rhythm or melody, rhyme or reason, metre or sense. Never was there so free and easy a school, and surely its founder, who announces himself as a 'teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely, egotism,' will not find it a very hard task to teach the young American idea how to shoot in that direction. Walt Whitman's egotism is twofold\u2014swaggering and brutish by virtue of his rowdyism, all conglomerating and incomprehensible by virtue of his pantheistic transcendentalism. As a rowdy, he asks, 'Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?' since, after the closest inquiry, 'I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.' Presently rising into a pantheistic strain he exclaims:\u2014</p><p>'Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or <br>am touched from,<br>The scent of these arm pits, aroma finer than prayer,<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some the spread of my <br>own body.'</p><p>A perfectly logical deduction from the premises. Since all things are divine, Walt Whitman's body, with each several part and function of it, is divine, and it becomes him to sing hymns to them all. To refrain from celebrating their praises would be rank impiety. Another corollary from the same principle is that there is not a pin's point to choose between good and evil:\u2014</p><p>'What blurt is this about virtue, and about vice?<br>Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me\u2014I stand indifferent,<br>My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,<br>I moisten the roots of all that has grown.'</p><p>All things being good, and equally good, all are alike fit for the poet's use, and he may jot them down pell-mell, without regard to order, proportion, or perspective. If he wish to cram as much poetry into his pages as they can hold, he has only to fill them with compendious inventories of all sorts of things. Pages by the score of Walt Whitman's poetry are made up of simple enumeration:\u2014</p><p>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,</p><p>is almost as rich a line as any among them, and so is\u2014</p><p>Moses, Homer, Neptune, Hercules, Wat Tyler, and Tycho Brahe.</p><p>According to the Emersonian jargon, the Ego and the Non Ego are one. The 'eternal and universal I' embraces and comprehends all nature. Walt Whitman is everything, and everything is Walt Whitman. He is here, there, and everywhere at the same moment. He is not born yet; he is dead and buried, alive and kicking. He is his own father and mother, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, lots of cousins, and all their progenitors; likewise his own children, nephews, and nieces, and all their posterity, for ever and ever. He is you and I, and the beef we eat, and the butcher that kills it, and the fire that cooks it; and he got drunk upon himself tomorrow, and will wake with a headache yesterday. Our own heads ache in trying to make head or tail of some of the polyphone utterances of this Protean, ubiquitous, and multitudinous person.

Now Mr. Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' puzzle us nearly as much as the Scotsman's query did the great actor. Are we criticising in these 'Leaves' prose or poetry? or rather something of an epicene gender, which unites in itself the bad qualities of both one and the other? So far as our perusal of the handsome volume before us has extended\u2014and we must admit that nothing can be more tasteful than its paper and typography\u2014we have scarcely been able to find a single consecutive sentence or expression out of which a meaning can be cudgelled. Taking an odd line here and there, and sometimes even as many as half a dozen, we can extract some hazy nonsense out of them; but what they have to do with those which go before or follow, or why they should be styled 'Chants Democratic,' or 'A Leaf of Faces,' or 'Calamus,' or anything else but 'sheer nonsense,' we have in vain tried to find out. Nor are we, that we know of, dealing with the productions of a lunatic. Mr. Walt Whitman is sane enough to do the poetry for an American newspaper or two: from whose columns these Leaves are reprints. In this degenerate land of Britain the only persons who nowadays keep a poet are, we believe, the members of an eminent Jewish clothing firm; and though we do not profess to be well versed in the lays of the bard in question, our impression is that they are quite as musical, and at least ten times as intelligible, as these 'Leaves of Grass'. After all, a horrible idea strikes us that our native land is not entirely guiltless of the paternity of this production. Can it be possible that Mr. Tupper's 'Proverbial Philosophy' has inspired Mr. Walt Whitman with the idea of his Leaves? We have most of us probably heard and read of persons who solved mathematical problems or composed poetry while asleep; and we think it just possible that the author of 'Proverbial Philosophy' may unconsciously, while suffering from a fit of the nightmare, have had something to do with the composition of these American Leaves. At least we trace in them some wild fantastic resemblance to his style; such as to make us pretty sure that Mr. Whitman has occasionally 'tasted the simple store and rested one soothing hour' with the English poetaster whose words we quote.</p><p>We give the five opening paragraphs or stanzas of a lucubration headed simply 'Walt Whitman.'</p><p>I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.</p><p>I loafe and invite my Soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.</p><p>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes\u2014the shelves are crowded with perfumes,<br>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it,<br>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.</p><p>The atmosphere is not a perfume\u2014it has no taste of the distillation, it is odourless,<br>It is for my mouth forever\u2014I am in love with it,<br>I will go to the bank by the wood, and become undisguised and naked,<br>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.</p><p>The smoke of my own breath,<br>Echoes, ripples, buzzed whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,<br>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air <br>through my lungs,<br>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore, and dark-coloured sea- <br>rocks, and of hay in the barn.<br>The sound of the belched words of my voice, words loosed to the eddies of the wind,<br>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,<br>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,<br>The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,<br>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting <br>the sun.</p><p>Now we assure our readers that these 'belched words,' to speak \u00e0 la Walt Whitman, are a perfectly fair, honest specimen of the four hundred and fifty-six pages of the volume before us.</p><p>'Walt Whitman' extends over eighty pages, and contains three hundred and seventy-two paragraphs and stanzas. We are particular in stating these items; and lest our readers should suppose we are unfairly mutilating this production, we assure them that we give each paragraph in full in making the following extracts, and that, so far as we can make out, each is perfect in itself.</p><p>In the ninety-sixth stanza we are asked</p><p>What is man anyhow? What am I? What are you?</p><p>Possibly the four following paragraphs which we quote may be supposed to answer this question:</p><p>All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over.<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth, the end but threadbare crape,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at <br>and tears.<br>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids \u2014conformity goes to the <br>fourth-removed,<br>I cock my hat as I please, indoors or out.<br>Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?</p><p>Our poet goes on to say (105):</p><p>I know I am august,<br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise,<br>I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.</p><p>And again (109):</p><p>I am the poet of the body,<br>And I am the poet of the soul.</p><p>Presently he dissects his own individuality a little more closely:</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding,<br>No sentimentalist\u2014no stander above men and women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!</p><p>Whoever degrades another degrades me,<br>And whatever is done or said returns at last to me,<br>And whatever I do or say, I also return.</p><p>Through me the afflatus surging and surging\u2014through me the current and index.</p><p>I speak the pass-word primeval\u2014I give the sign of democracy,<br>By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the <br>same terms.</p><p>The succeeding 'voices,' though, as the writer tells us, they are 'voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured,' strike us, so far as they can be conjectured to mean anything, as retaining all their pristine indecency.</p><p>And in this way our American nonsense-verse writer maunders on for some hundred pages, sometimes 'doting on himself\u2014there is that lot of me, and all is so luscious;' now 'snuffing the sidle of evening,' whatever that may be; or asking\u2014</p><p>Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well, then, I contradict myself;<br>I am large\u2014I contain multitudes.</p><p>Verily we for once agree with him when he says:</p><p>I am untranslatable:<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>One of the most curious whims of Mr. Walt Whitman is to give his readers from time to time inventories of the various component parts of some thing or person. Thus (in pages 300-2) we might for a brief moment fancy ourselves poring over a manual of surgery. The mention of the word 'body' enables him to write down about one hundred and fifty different items which belong, or may be supposed by poetical licence to belong, to the human form divine. Some of the terms, as 'neck-slue,' 'man-balls,' 'inward and outward rounds,' 'the flex of the mouth,' are to us rather vague; and we scarcely wonder at their exciting 'the curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of his own body or another person's body.' So again we have lists, extending over more than a page, or an iron-monger's and carpenter's shop or store, &c. &c., interspersed with such lyric strophes as the following:</p><p>Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you was once drunk, or a thief, or <br>diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now, or from frivolity or impo-<br>tence, or that you are no scholar, and never saw your name in print, do you give <br>in that you are any less immortal?</p><p>There are some other specimens of Mr. Walt Whitman's muse\u2014for we have now discovered that this amazing rubbish is meant for poetry\u2014which we had rather not quote, for decency's sake; and we fancy our readers will by this time one and all be inclined to cry, Ohe jam satis! Nevertheless we have not altogether wasted their time. They ought to know that this pure unmitigated trash is read and admired by not a few persons in America; and that what would go far in England to stamp its inditer as a lunatic has earned in America for its writer a poet's crown.</p><p>Me quoque vatem<br>Pastores dicunt; sed non ego credulus illis,</p><p>says Virgil's modest swain. Not so, however, with Walt Whitman. He tells us many times over that he is a son of song; and that the 'daughter of the lands' (which we suppose means America) has been 'waiting for a poet with a flowing mouth and indicative hand'\u2014a vision realised doubtless in himself.</p><p>We shall conclude with saying that one of the most curious traits of this volume is the crazy earnestness with which the writer believes in his own poetical infallibility. He is not only a poet, but the poet; not only a teacher, but the teacher. To be sure, it follows that if Mr. Walt Whitman really be a poet, and if the contents of this book really be poetry, what Shakespeare and Milton have written must be styled by some new name. Sense, grammar, and metre are but very minor parts in the composition of poetry; but nevertheless, pace Walt Whitman, poetry cannot exist without this humble triad.</p>", "date": "July 14 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Critic", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1860\u201361)].\" 14 July 1860.

The former production he greeted with the exclamation, 'This will never do!' and the opening words of his critique on the latter were graduated to a point no finer than to say, 'This, we think, has the merit of being the very worst poem we ever saw imprinted in a quarto volume.' If the Aristarch of 'Scotch Reviewers' were still in the flesh, and felt called, in the spirit of the Rhadamanthine motto which he placed at the head of the Edinburgh Review, to let no offender against the canons of criticism escape unpunished, we are pretty sure that in proceeding to pronounce sentence on Walt Whitman he would don the black cap with as much insouciance as Lord Braxfield when it became the pleasing duty of that model judge to administer the last rites of the law to a prisoner arraigned on some charge of sedition against the King's Government. 'Ye're a vera clever chiel man,' was the soothing address once made by this ornament of the Scottish Themis to an eloquent criminal at his bar, 'but ye wad be nane the waur o' a hanging:' and if such was the festive wit and humor which marked trials for political offences in Scotland as late as 1794, it is unnecessary to add that the year of grace 1814 was any thing but a year of grace to such 'English bards' as fell into the clutches of the Edinburgh reviewer.</p><p>We do not know that Jeffrey would have pronounced 'The Leaves of Grass' to be the worst poem ever honored with exquisite typography, imprinted on paper of irreproachable quality, but we are pretty certain he would have conceded to it the merit of being the strangest-born among all the intellectual freaks of nature he had ever been called to inspect and analyze.</p><p>Such of our readers as are blessed with good memories may recognise in Walt Whitman a former acquaintance, for the 'Leaves of Grass' which he here presents to us, pressed and dried in a new herbarium, first disclosed their verdant honors four or five years ago, and were then duly brought by us to the notice of the 'discerning public.' We then undertook at some length to characterize this singular production by saying that Walt Whitman, who describes himself as</p><p>\u2014\u2014an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, &c.</p><p>was the 'poet of pantheism,' and that the book which he has here given us, in the shape of runic rhymes and bardic symbols, was incapable of classification under any of the forms previously recognised in the world of letters. Unique in his literary style, Walt is, like a genuine disciple of Spinoza, perfectly indifferent with regard to the matter that enters into the composition of his book. Things good and things bad, things decent and things indecent, things pretty to the eye and things ugly, things sweet to the taste and things bitter, things fragrant to the nostrils and things noisome, things smooth to the touch and things rough, are to him all one and the same. Accordingly the reader will find in this 'poem' an inventory (expressed in a style something like a cross between Butler's Hudibras and an auctioneer's advertisement) of all things good and bad, decent and indecent, pretty and ugly, sweet and bitter, fragrant and noisome, smooth and rough, enumerated in categories designed to exhaust the sensations of humanity and hold the mirror up to the universe at large.</p><p>M. Jourdain, in the play of Racine, was surprised to learn from his erudite master in philosophy that for more than forty years he had been talking prose without knowing it. It were no great wonder, after the success of Walt Whitman, if many persons who have never talked any thing but the most unmitigated nonsense should congratulate themselves on the discovery that they have all the while been Miltons in disguise.</p>", "date": "July 14 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Daily National Intelligencer", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1860\u201361)].\" 14 July 1860.

The sensations of the roofs under this process are, as may be imagined, various and strong. 'Some said that it thundered, others that an angel spoke.' The Christian Examiner, with the unctuous air of one who has just read without blinking the accounts of Joseph and Potiphar, Judah and Tamar, pronounces it 'impious and obscene.'

The Leaves of Grass has been our companion out in the wild outlooks of Newport and Nahant, we have read it at night after following the throngs of New York by day, we have conversed with its music when the obligato was the whizz and scream of the locomotive which bore us across the continent, and have turned to it from the calm rush of the Father of Waters, from the loading here and there on its shores by the glare of pine-knot fires, from the eager crowd of men and women chatting, singing, gaming in the saloon, and we confidently announce that Walt Whitman has set the pulses of America to music. Here are the incomplete but real utterances of New York city, of the prairies, of the Ohio and Mississippi,\u2014the volume of American autographs. To these formidable eyes the goddess Yoganidra, who veils the world in illusion, surrenders; to them there are no walls, nor fences, nor dress-coats, no sheaths of faces and eyes.

Lizst did not say anything, but went to the open piano and struck with grandeur the opening chords of the Tannha\u0081ser overture; having played it through, he turned and quietly remarked, 'The man who doesn't call that good music is a fool.' It is the only reply which can be made to those who do not find that quintessence of things which we call Poetry in many passages of this work.</p><p>We can not, nor do we wish to deny that biblical plainness of speech which characterizes these poems; we or nature are in some regards so untranslateable that in some of these pages one must hold his nose whilst he reads; the writer does not hesitate to bring the slop-bucket into the parlor to show you that therein also the chemic laws are at work; but to lose the great utterances which are in this work because of these, is as if one should commit suicide, refusing to dwell on the planet because it was not all an English Park, but had here and there a Dismal Swamp or a dreary desert.

From the journals therefore, and from talk of those who know him, we gather that WALT WHITMAN lives in Brooklyn, that he has been a printer, and an omnibus-driver, that he wears a red flannel shirt, and habitually stands with his hands in his pockets; that he is not chaste nor clean, despising with equal scorn the conventional purity of linen, and the conventional rules of verse; that he is sublime and at the same time beastly; that he has a wonderful brain and an unwashed body. Five years ago, he gave to light the first edition of the 'LEAVES OF GRASS,' which excited, by its utter lawlessness, the admiration of those who believe liberty to mean the destruction of government, and disgusting many persons of fine feelings. We remember to have seen a brief criticism of the book in dear dead Putnam, by a critic who seemed to have argued himself into a complete state of uncertainty, and who oracularly delivered an opinion formed upon the model of the judge's charge in Bardell and Pickwick. RALPH WALDO EMERSON, however, took by the horns this bull that had plunged into the china-shop of poetical literature, threatening all the pretty Dresden ornaments, and nice little cups with gold bands on them, and pronounced him a splendid animal\u2014and left people to infer that he was some such inspired brute as Jove infurried (sic), when he played Europa that sad trick.</p><p>But presently the bull\u2014being a mere brute\u2014was forgotten, and the china-shop was furnished forth anew with delicate wares\u2014new-fashioned dolls, bubble-thin goblets, and dainty match-safes.</p><p>Nearly a year ago, the bull put his head through the NEW YORK SATURDAY PRESS enclosure, and bellowed loud, long, and unintelligibly.</p><p>The mystery of the thing made it all the more appalling.</p><p>The Misses Nancy of criticism hastened to scramble over the fence, and on the other side, stood shaking their fans and parasols at the wretch, and shrieking, 'Beast!

The author seems to exult in being as indecent, obscene, and profane as possible. This is the more to be regretted, because, in the midst of a great deal of the silliest twaddle, and the most unmeaning bombast, we find thoughts of rare beauty and striking force, wonderful felicity of expression, and imagery at once the boldest and most pleasing. Nor are the passages of the latter kind by any means few; although, undoubtedly, the predominating qualities throughout the book are coarseness and vulgarity; so that we often meet with whole stanzas which are too filthy to be quoted. There is a modesty in nature herself, which those who understand her will not overstep; but Walt Whitman (for this we understand is the name of the would-be Homer) goes beyond nature, or rather, in most cases he fails to reach her. Decency requires that we sometimes draw a veil over what is natural; but though such is hidden by common consent, it is not absurd or revolting like many of the images and precepts of Mr. Walt Whitman. We have, now, neither time nor space to illustrate our remarks by suitable extracts. We will, however, give two or three, which we think will sufficiently justify our views, if they do not give a correct idea of the true character of 'Leaves of Grass.' Such egotism and bravado as the following, are to be found at almost every page:</p><p>'I believe in the flesh, and the appetites,<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part <br>and tag of me is a miracle.</p><p>Divine am I, inside and out, and I make holy what-<br>ever I touch, or am touched from,<br>The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer,<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some of <br>the spread of my own body.'\u2014p. 55.</p><p>Be it observed, that this is chaste and decent compared to what follows, but which we take care to omit. Nor is he, generally, much more pleasing or poetical in his scenic descriptions. Thus in describing a sea-fight, he sings (?):</p><p>'We had received some eighteen pound shots under the water,<br>On our lower gun-deck two large pieces burst at <br>the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up over-<br>head.'\u2014p. 76.</p><p>As a specimen of his patriotism, we give one stanza:</p><p>'To you of New England,<br>To the man of the sea-side State, and of Pennsylvania,<br>To the Canadian of the North\u2014to the Southerner I <br>love,<br>These with perfect trust, to depict you as myself\u2014 <br>the germs are in all men;<br>I believe the main purport of these States is to be found <br>a superb friendship, exalt\u00e9, previously unknown,<br>Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting in all <br>men.'\u2014p. 374.</p><p>Leaving poetry out of the question, it would be difficult to find duller prose than this. Yet, as we have said, Walt Whitman can be occasionally musical, tender, and pathetic. As an instance, we quote a part of a death-bed scene, which is as beautifully drawn as it is truthful and touching:</p><p>'When the dull nights are over, and the dull days also,<br>When the soreness of lying so much in bed is over,<br>When the physician; after long putting off, gives the silent and <br>terrible look for an answer,<br>When the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers <br>and sister have been sent for,<br>When medicine stand unused on the shelf, and the camphor smell <br>has pervaded the rooms,<br>When the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of <br>the dying,<br>When the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,<br>When the breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,<br>Then the corpse-limbs stretch on the bed, and the living look upon <br>them,<br>They are palpable as the living are palpable.<br>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously <br>on the corpse.'</p><p>Nor is this, by any means, the best we could cull from the pages of 'Leaves of Grass.' We have read and reread in it many passages much more exquisite; but nevertheless, we cannot regard Walt Whitman as a true poet. That he has genius there can be no doubt, though it is certainly not of a high order. In wading through his uncouth rhapsodies, we are reminded of the pompous, but generally empty speeches which Homer puts into the mouth of Paris, especially of that line in which he makes Helen inform us that the braggart libertine was but ill supplied with sense\u2014</p><p>\u03a4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03b4' \u03bf\u1f52\u03c4' \u1fb6\u03c1 \u03bd\u1fe6\u03bd \u03d5\u03c1\u1f73\u03bd\u03b5\u03db \u1f14\u03bc\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f52\u03c4' \u1f04\u03c1' \u1f41\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b4\u03c9\u1f14\u03b4\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.<em>1</em></p><p>The publishers have done their part well.

Many individuals of the 'owl species' see nothing but Walt Whitman in these poems. He\u2014'one of the roughs, disorderly, fleshly and sensual'\u2014intrudes himself upon them in every sentence, and repeats 'the unquenchable creed\u2014egotism' on every page. It is undoubtedly a grave offence for an author to thrust his personality between the reader and the truth which the book is intended to embody or set forth. But this is a grand poem of human nature. Man, his origin, nature, and destiny, and the grandeur of these, is the subject; and the author chooses to treat it in the first person, that is all.</p><p>'I celebrate myself,And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.'</p><p>This was the first sentence in the poems as originally published, and to us it was the key to everything that followed. We have been drawn irresistibly to the book, again and again, for there is a simple-minded and strong man speaking in his strength and simplicity. Walt comes to us, with his Leaves of Grass, a true child of nature\u2014of the earth and the stars, and of what is beyond. He scornfully refuses to be judged by any ordinary, conventional standard of Art, for he, indeed, is no artist, but the born priest and hierophant of the mystic, unfathomable universe. He sees that everything is divine; that God is in all, over all, and under all; that there is nothing mean, without a purpose, or out of its place. He is so full of profound reverence for the old Divine Mother that she, in return, presses him to her bosom, and showers upon him all the wealth of her limitless love\u2014so full of child-like playfulness, confidence and simplicity, that, as he 'leans and loafes at his ease, observing a spear of summer grass,' all her children press round him with uproarious, sunny laughters, weaving wild flowers in his hair, and kissing him with kisses that breathe the odors of heaven. To him the universe is a miraculum ingens, pregnant with profound mysteries; but he himself is also a miracle\u2014the greatest of miracles. A soft whisper tells him that he is 'the acme of things accomplished.' All the ages have borne him in solemn procession from chaos and primeval night until now. Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me, Afar down I see the huge first Nothing\u2014I know I was even there.</p><p>****</p><p>'Immense have been the preparations for me,<br>Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me.<br>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.</p><p>****</p><p>All forces have been steadily employed to complete and delight me:<br>Now I stand on this spot with my Soul.</p><p>****</p><p>The SOUL!<br>Forever and forever\u2014longer than soil is brown and solid\u2014longer than water ebbs and flows.'</p><p>He takes the loftiest views of man, reverences all his parts, and will not have any thing omitted. He is the poet of the body and of the soul, of the passions and the organs, and of all their manifestations, normal and beautiful, or otherwise. Truth, beauty, goodness, heroism, justice\u2014these he recognizes, receives, and takes courage from them; falsehood, uglines [sic], depravity, cowardice and oppression\u2014he sees these, also, with clear vision, but knows that God and Order reign, not Chaos and the Devil,\u2014and therefore receives them, confident that, for a season, they too have their place. Of the sexes and sexual relation, no previous poet has spoken so freely and so well. This opinion will doubtless astonish many who have read the book. Nor are we surprised that so many find in the 'Enfans d' Adam' only the drunken and obscene ravings of a 'new, astonishing Phallus worship.' 'All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it.'</p><p>****</p><p>'All music is what awakes from you, when you are reminded by the instruments.'</p><p>There is such a deep and unmitigated vulgarity and coarseness in the inner life of the people, that no direct allusion can be made to the sexual relations without exciting simpering smiles and blushes, or rude, profane mirth. What of moral elevation, simplicity and genuine purity can there be in a people that persists in speaking of the limbs of a table or chair? We are disgusted with this substitution of seeming for being, and the insufferable cant and hypocrisy to which it gives rise. Thou, friend, who hast hitherto seen nothing but the madness of phallic processions in this poem, go wash thyself, make thyself clean, then return to it and reflect. Think of what precise thing thou hast hitherto made the phallus a symbol, and with what associations\u2014what thou hast done to it when looking upon it! and then decide where the obscenity resides.</p><p>As for us, we heartily thank Walt Whitman for the clear, distinct, manly and pure voice with which he has spoken of these things, and hail it as the dawn of a wiser and better era, in which men and women will no longer speak of the limbs of tables and chairs. Nor will any pure and ingenuous mind torture this into an endorsement of rude, low and lascivious talk, but will rather receive it as the indication of an intense desire to be at once and forever free from all such.</p><p>We have much more to say of Walt\u2014strong, brave lover of man, and uncompromising champion of man's rights, that he is\u2014but must defer it to a more convenient opportunity. In the meantime, we would advise all who have escaped the dominion of the passions and the appetites, and who have any appreciation of the essential dignity of man and the grandeur of his destiny, to buy the book, and read it.</p><p>T.

Such egotism and bravado as the following, are to be found at almost every page:</p><p>'I believe in the flesh, and the appetites,<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part <br>and tag of me is a miracle.</p><p>Divine am I, inside and out, and I make holy what-<br>ever I touch, or am touched from,<br>The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer,<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some of <br>the spread of my own body.'\u2014p. 55.</p><p>Be it observed, that this is chaste and decent compared to what follows, but which we take care to omit. Nor is he, generally, much more pleasing or poetical in his scenic descriptions. Thus in describing a sea-fight, he sings (?):</p><p>'We had received some eighteen pound shots under the water,<br>On our lower gun-deck two large pieces burst at <br>the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up over-<br>head.'\u2014p. 76.</p><p>As a specimen of his patriotism, we give one stanza:</p><p>'To you of New England,<br>To the man of the sea-side State, and of Pennsylvania,<br>To the Canadian of the North\u2014to the Southerner I <br>love,<br>These with perfect trust, to depict you as myself\u2014 <br>the germs are in all men;<br>I believe the main purport of these States is to be found <br>a superb friendship, exalt\u00e9, previously unknown,<br>Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting in all <br>men.'\u2014p. 374.</p><p>Leaving poetry out of the question, it would be difficult to find duller prose than this. Yet, as we have said, Walt Whitman can be occasionally musical, tender, and pathetic. As an instance, we quote a part of a death-bed scene, which is as beautifully drawn as it is truthful and touching:</p><p>'When the dull nights are over, and the dull days also,<br>When the soreness of lying so much in bed is over,<br>When the physician; after long putting off, gives the silent and <br>terrible look for an answer,<br>When the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers <br>and sister have been sent for,<br>When medicine stand unused on the shelf, and the camphor smell <br>has pervaded the rooms,<br>When the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of <br>the dying,<br>When the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,<br>When the breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,<br>Then the corpse-limbs stretch on the bed, and the living look upon <br>them,<br>They are palpable as the living are palpable.<br>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously <br>on the corpse.'</p><p>Nor is this, by any means, the best we could cull from the pages of 'Leaves of Grass.' We have read and reread in it many passages much more exquisite; but nevertheless, we cannot regard Walt Whitman as a true poet. That he has genius there can be no doubt, though it is certainly not of a high order. In wading through his uncouth rhapsodies, we are reminded of the pompous, but generally empty speeches which Homer puts into the mouth of Paris, especially of that line in which he makes Helen inform us that the braggart libertine was but ill supplied with sense\u2014</p><p>\u03a4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03b4' \u03bf\u1f52\u03c4' \u1fb6\u03c1 \u03bd\u1fe6\u03bd \u03d5\u03c1\u1f73\u03bd\u03b5\u03db \u1f14\u03bc\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f52\u03c4' \u1f04\u03c1' \u1f41\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b4\u03c9\u1f14\u03b4\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.<em>1</em></p><p>The publishers have done their part well.

That he has any direct acquaintance with those forms of German speculation on which he falls back for the justification of the language he makes use of, we think may be confidently denied, not only from the manner in which he conceives its problems, but from the absence of any German catch words with which he would otherwise have infallibly adorned his motley, for even an ignorance of its grammar does not daunt him when the French language offers a term to his taste. Mr. Emerson has much to answer for, and will in reputation dearly pay for the fervid encomium with which he introduced the Author to the American public. That to the public defence of polygamy and slavery, should now be added that of the emancipation of the flesh, is an indication of a moral disorganization in the States, which is of every evil promise. That a drunken Helot should display himself without shame in the market place, speaks sad reproach to the public that does not scourge him back to his cellar.</p><p>In form these poems, if poems they can be called, are composed in irregular rhythmical lines, after the manner of Tupper, and in fact they may be described by the following equation,\u2014as Tupper is to English Humdrum, so is Walt Whitman to the American Rowdy. They have been praised as containing many poetical passages; in this opinion we cannot concur.

Quacks got, or said they did, their pills from the Orient; astrologers sent to Egypt for stuffed crocodiles, and readers of romance pronounced the 'Arabian Nights' the most wonderful of books. Things have altered. The arrival of an East-Indiaman is no longer regarded as an event, and, acting in obedience to the prophecy of Bishop Berkeley\u2014</p><p>'Westward the course of empire takes its way.'\u2014</p><p>people now look across the Atlantic for the wonderful and strange. Every steamer from America bears a marvel of some sort or another. The old woman's tale of there being but eight wonders in the world has long been an idle story; a brick without the least straw in it, which fell to pieces the moment the first pedlar from Connecticut landed in Liverpool with a pine clock of home manufacture; the arrival, one after the other, of wooden nutmegs, scrubbing-boards, machines for doing all the reaping, washing, pill-making, shirt-sewing, and baby-rocking, only prove the inanition of the used-up East and the productiveness of the West,\u2014or the Great West, as the playful Yankee prefers terming his native soil. There is one commodity, however, associated with the dusky East, which foolish people believe yet to come over in packages of tea and China jars\u2014fine old unintelligible poetry, that imaginative compound which may be observed on the sides of tea-chests, and dancing over Indian porcelain. Ah, well! America now supplies that too, and the East is cheated out of a staple commodity.</p><p>At the present moment certain imaginative persons in the United States are engaged in crowning with laurel a new poet. Flaxen-haired Byronic youths have had their day, and now the path is cleared for the thick-necked 'navvy' school. We learn that in certain quarters the muscular poet is popular, and whilst all the young ladies here, dotted up and down our coasts and in green arbours, are trusting their imaginations to the bewitching 'Idyls' of Tennyson, their sisters across the water, at Saratoga, or the Falls, are in love with Walt Whitman.</p><p>It seems ridiculous, but still we are assured of the fact, that by many persons in the United States, the author of 'Leaves of Grass' is regarded as not far short in powers of inspiration to Our Savior. The parallel is impious and disgusting, and but for our knowledge that there are such people as the Mormons, and such institutions as the Agapemone,1 we should be very loth to believe that it was ever instituted amongst even the weak intellects of the sister country.</p><p>From the circumstances, however, we may learn a lesson. Civilization kept at a very high point of pressure, the economy of life too refined, nature put back into the shade too far, produces strange tastes and fancies that are unknown to health. There is a certain stage in disease, the doctors tell us, when the patient has a keen appetite after all sorts of odd things,\u2014slate pencil, corks, or leather. So with the literature of a crowded and anxious people, it occasionally exceeds its proper bounds, suffers plethors, and puts forth pimples which diseased minds mistake for true health. Such unhealthy excrescences are the 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>It appears that in New York, some years ago, a rough fellow was employed in a printing office. Nature had given him a strong constitution, and his features were those of a dreamy sensualist. Now, it is well known that nothing in the United States stands still\u2014a servant to-day, master to-morrow; now teaching a school in the backwoods, anon the head of a bureau at Washington; therefore there is nothing wonderful in the fact that Whitman was soon holding the pen of a journalist, and writing for a democratic paper. After trying various schemes for the exercise of his muscular pen, he hit upon what he conceived to be a new vein of poetry. The 'poetry' is not poetry, but 'verse'\u2014and worse, and the 'vein' is of a kind that we are thankful is seldom opened. The metre of Longfellow's 'Hiawatha,'2 it will be remembered, was peculiar, and, upon first acquaintance, not remarkably pleasant, but it is music compared with Whitman's lines. Here are a few selected at random. They remind one of so many negro shouts:\u2014</p><p>'Americanos! Masters!<br>Marches humanitarian! Foremost!<br>Century Marches! Libertad! Masses!<br>For you a programme of chants.'</p><p>Other paragraphs\u2014or muscular verses, we suppose the poet would term them\u2014read like cuttings from a backwood's newspaper, or notes from a stump orator's speech. At page 119 we have\u2014</p><p>'What does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities?\u2014Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian,\u2014native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?'</p><p>We believe it is the author's boast that he is the sole discoverer of the metre in which he indulges, and that its originality is the delight of his poetic admirers. But the leading principle of the book, where the sense is intelligible, appears to be the praise of muscle, rude force, a strong arm, a stout body, and such a love for the softer sex as we may imagine to be common amongst the lusty black vagabonds of Central Africa. The writer describes himself in several places.</p><p>'Free, fresh, savage,<br>Fluent, luxuriant, self-content, fond of persons and places;<br>Fond of fish-shape Paumanok (where I was born),<br>Fond of the sea\u2014lusty-begotten and various.<br>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217<br>Aware of the buffalo, the peace-herds, the bull, strong-breasted and hairy;<br>Aware of the mocking-bird of the wilds at day-break,<br>Solitary, singing in the west, I strike up for a new world.<br>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking,<br>No sentimentalist\u2014no stander above men and women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.'</p><p>But enough is better than a feast of this stuff. It would be impossible to transcribe from any part of the book without offending common sense, and it is difficult to select a passage that does not set all refinement and modesty at defiance. Any idea that presented itself to the author's mind, he appears to have jotted down as the poetry of inspiration. After this rule the whole vagrant thoughts of a London dustman or coalheaver, for twenty-four hours, would make a dainty little volume.</p><p>The very get-up of the book, with its rough bark-like binding, only bears out the author's idea of ruggedness. Nature without any trammels, in a sort of pre-Adamite costume of leaves, is what the author's mind continually runs upon. His portrait, given as a frontispiece, also assits the idea. his hair has been allowed to grow in an unkempt fashion over his face, his eyes look at you sleepily and sensually, whilst his shirt collar, undone, displays the hairy breast of a barge-man. In his verses he is continually speaking of love and brotherly feeling. Some time ago, so the story goes, he made the unpoetic acquaintance of a New York omnibus driver. The driver fell sick, and there, up and down Broadway for a fortnight, was the muscular verse-maker to be seen, with his sun-burnt face and flying shirt-collar, driving his friend's omnibus.</p><p>Think of Tennyson's 'fooling' a Putney bus, and Tupper3 behind handing people in and out! The circumstances came to the knowledge of some sickly sentimental readers, and forthwith Whitman's poetry was called for. Another reason of the rugged versifier finding readers, may be found in the fact that Emerson, on more than one occasion, has patted him on the back approvingly. We pity the philosopher's selection, and can only conceive that the patronage was accorded in the belief that the muscular scribbler was trying to speak the voice of nature;\u2014that so filled had the found the world with sham, that even the vulgar inditings of an uneducated man, free from any Old World philosophy, or Old World religion, were, in his opinion, worthy of approbation. Of a truth that philosophy may be doubted which would reduce society once more to a farm-yard, with such pastoral poets to sing of love and nature as Walt Whitman.</p>", "date": "October 13 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "London Review and Weekly Journal of Politics, Society, Literature, and Art", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Verse\u2014and Worse.\" 13 October 1860.

Their authors for the most part belong to the foggy or to the flippant schools of book-makers; for the former Emerson and his 'set' are partly responsible. These scribblers seem to fancy that it is a mark of genius to be mysterious; they hide one grain of thought in a bushel of chaff and have the assurance to ask us to look for it. Oh! for the days and works of Goldsmith, Addison and Irving, who drew from pure wells of English undefiled, and charmed us by their simplicity.

This Frankenstein,\u2014this attendant spirit,\u2014is faithful, but unruly. It multiplies every action, whim, or fancy that it copies by three or four; it leaps higher, dives lower, speaks louder, and goes farther than its master; and often succeeds in so far dazzling a certain circle of admirers that they prefer the coarse copy to the pure original. Mr. Thomas Carlyle must be often haunted by some such phantom, who speaks to him in crabbed sentences more affected than his own, and exhibits even more fretful impatience of shams and windbags. Mr. Charles Dickens has often suffered from demons of this kind, who have visited him in huge genial masks, in huge pathetic masks, and in huge humourous masks; and Mr. Thackeray has been unable to shut out electro-plated familiars, who have shown him his own image, distorted and magnified.</p><p>Most authors of this rank have had their trials, and now comes the turn of Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson. A nature worshipper so devout; a mystic so often incomprehensible; a prose poet who uses language, as some people think it ought to be used, to conceal thoughts, or perhaps the want of thoughts, could hardly hope to escape imitators, where imitation was so easy. He may have expected the visitation to fall rather heavily when it came in the fullness of time; but he could never have been prepared for such a muscular caricature as Walt Whitman. The sternest enemy of the American philosopher and of the great fog-bank school to which he, in some measure, belongs, cannot fail to pity him under such an affliction.</p><p>Walt Whitman, or, as we should prefer to call him, Emerson's monster, or wild poet of the woods, is a thoroughly untamed, muscular, unconventional writer. What Emerson talks about doing, or seems to wish to do, Walt Whitman to all appearance does. Emerson only asks for health and a day to make the pomp of emperors ridiculous; Walt Whitman has got health of the rudest kind, with many days, and he glorifies the whole weighable, pinchable, material universe. No form or manifestation of matter is mean or contemptible to him. Like the great practical poet, alluded to in our last number, he would chant a great guano lyric, though with a far louder voice, and in a very different tune. If he fell in a gutter, he would rise up shaking his muddy locks, and dash onwards like the 'strong-breasted bull' which meets with his admiration. He describes himself in a coarse, sing-song, rugged stanza as,\u2014</p><p>'Free, fresh, savage,<br>Fluent, luxuriant, self-content, fond of persons and places,<br>Fond of fish-shaped Paumanok, where I was born,<br>Fond of the sea.'</p><p>He might have added in plain prose, and no one would have discovered the difference,\u2014'fond of rump steaks and oyster sauce, legs of mutton, pots of beer, cart-horses, wrestling, and lifting weights.' He chants in this strain page after page:\u2014</p><p>'No dainty dolce affettuoso I;<br>Bearded, sunburnt, gray-necked, forbidding, I have arrived<br>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the uni-<br>verse. . . . .</p><p>The dustman, the 'navvy,' the slaughterer of oxen, have at length found their poet. He sings the song of all creation. His invitations have no limit:\u2014</p><p>'This is the meal pleasantly set,\u2014this is the meat and drink for natural hunger.</p><p>'It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous. I make appointments with all; I will not have a single person slighted or left away. The \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 , sponger, thief, are hereby invited. The heavy-lipped slave is invited,\u2014the \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 is invited.</p><p>'There shall be no difference between them and the rest.</p><p>The entertainment is the same, whether for man or for beast. If anything, perhaps, Walt Whitman has a partiality for the beast:\u2014</p><p>'I behold the picturesque giant and love him,\u2014<br>And I do not stop there,<br>I go with the team also.'<br>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217<br>'Oxen that rattle the yoke or halt in the shade!<br>What is that you express in your eyes?<br>It seem to me more than all the print I have read in my life.'<br>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217<br>'The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,<br>Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;<br>The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close,<br>I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.<br>The sharp-hoofed moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, <br>the chickadee, the prairie-dog,<br>The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,<br>The brood of the turkey-hen. . . . .<br>I see in them and myself the same old law.'</p><p>Every word of this might have been written by Emerson muscularized;\u2014by Emerson at the age of thirty-two, trained by a New York 'rowdy' into a state of firm, animal, pugilistic vigour. To come a little nearer home, every line might have been written by one of Barclay and Perkins's draymen, by a Rotherhithe coal-whipper, by a Billingsgate fish-hauler, a canal bargeman, a sewer-cleanser, a meat-porter at Newgate market, or an average pot-boy who had learned to read and spell. What Dr. Johnson said of the famous Percy ballads, may be said of poems like these 'leaves of grass;'\u2014they can be spun by one at the rate of six yards an hour. This is a chant of the lands:\u2014</p><p>'O the lands!<br>Lands scorning invaders! Interlinked, food-yielding lands!<br>Land of coal and iron! Land of gold! Lands of cotton, sugar, <br>rice!<br>Odorous and sunny land! Floridian land!<br>Land of the spinal river, the Mississippi! Land of the Alle-<br>ghanies! Ohio's land!<br>Land of wheat, beef, pork! Land of wool and hemp!<br>Land of the potato, the apple, and the grape!'<p><p>This goes on for many pages more, and there is really no reason why it should ever stop at all. Cyclop\u00e6dias, commercial dictionaries, directories, and such books are plentiful enough, and in the slang of our wild poet of the woods they contain thousands, millions of such poems. Everything is a poem in the Walt Whitman sense, as everything, by a similar wrenching of language, might have been called a fish-kettle, a pitchfork, or a blacking-bottle. There used to be a favourite class of comic songs which proved all men to be gardeners, scrubbing-brushes, or lucifer-matches, according as the whim started. These dreary pieces of laboured humour are not as popular now as they were twenty years ago, but Walt Whitman, if he gains such a hearing here as he has in America, ought certainly to bring them once more into fashion.</p><p>There is a certain philosophy in all this muscular poetry,\u2014the philosophy of making money by creating a sensation. The world is always on the look out for anything wild, strange, and eccentric. If Walt Whitman had had the power or the inclination to put his common-places into intelligible forms and language, the 'leaves of grass' would never have made hay while the sun shone. The tricks of authorship are not yet half catalogued, or half exhausted. We must have treatises upon logic written by street tumblers, or rather we must have authors of such works keen enough to take to street tumbling to stimulate the sale of their books. We must have an epic poem written by the keeper of a Shoreditch baked-potato-can, or rather we must have the writer of an epic poem go out with a potato-can to make his poetry popular. The science of advertising is in its infancy, and America, so it seems, can give the mother country a 'few wrinkles' on this subject. When Walt Whitman, as the story goes, drove an omnibus along Broadway to oblige the regular driver, who was laid up with a fever, we have no doubt that his charity proved a remarkably good investment. We have no means of overhauling his publishing accounts, to see what effect the public excitement had upon his 'editions,' but we have no doubt that many people never bought his book until after they found him driving an omnibus.</p><p>As it is not fair to blame the son alone while the father is living, we should like to have Mr. Emerson's calm opinion of his literary offspring. The rumour runs that the philosopher is rather proud of his wild poet of the woods, and reads the 'leaves of grass' with infinite pleasure. If this is so, he must be deceived by the poet's 'yearnings after the infinite,' which are about as intelligible as a dog's baying at the moon. The inventory of nature is the only thing solid in a book, one-half of which is quite as coarse as Rabelais, and just as obscure. The passages that look profound are not worthy of sustained thought and investigation, because they are deliberately made nonsense-riddles that never had an 'answer.'</p><p>JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD.</p>", "date": "February 1861", "year": 1861, "creator": "John Hollingshead", "publication": "The Irish Literary Gazette and Register", "citation": "Hollingshead, John. \"A Wild Poet of the Woods.\" February 1861.

Of the few, moreover, who have previously heard the name still fewer have had the opportunity of seeing the work to which it owes whatever celebrity it may have attained. Yet its bearer is a man of some mark in America, and his work has not only startled the few educated Englishmen who have seen it, but is undoubtedly destined to hold a prominent position in American literature. Many causes contribute to render Leaves of Grass, as Walt Whitman's principal work is called, a sealed book to English readers. The first reason is its costliness. A dozen copies would scarcely, we should suppose, reward the most diligent search that could be instituted through England, and, probably, not a quarter of that number is on sale. When met with at the establishments of the principal American bookselling agents, the price of the volume is as much as is asked for the complete works of Tennyson or Swinburne. A second reason for the scarcity of the book is that the form of its composition is not at first glance attractive, and that its contents are such as cannot possibly be admitted into family reading. Leaves of Grass, is, however, the most thoroughly national and characteristic American poem that has yet seen the light, and is a work the influence of which will yet be felt. It is a book concerning which Englishmen ought to know at least a little. For various reasons, then, among which figures prominently the difficulty in obtaining the volume, we hold we are rendering a real service to our readers in bringing under their observation a few striking features in this remarkable and most suggestive work.</p><p>We have spoken of it as national and characteristic in the fullest sense, and so it is. An Englishman might have written ninety-nine hundredths of American poetry. Scarcely a line or stanza in Longfellow, Holmes, Bryant, Whittier, that is in the fullest sense American. The philosophical poems of Emerson have a flavour of nationality, and a very strong taste thereof pervades such comic works as the Big[e]low papers, and other similar productions. But those comic works which aim at satirising the manners and customs of every-day life are necessarily the first parts of a young nation's literature, in which local colour is observable. Before the appearance of Leaves of Grass, no serious American work was wholly or in any wide sense national. The spirit that pervades Leaves of Grass is essentially American. It is more. To use a word the author is fond of, it is Manhattanese. A resident in the capital of the Empire State alone could have produced it. The rowdyism and greed of New York life, as well as its higher qualities, pervade it. Walt Whitman is as completely a New Yorkist as Charles Lamb was a Londoner or Christopher North a Scot. Not that he is uninfluenced by preceding writers of other countries. On the contrary, his work is, to some extent, an olla podrida of other people's thoughts, manners, and forms, but the main current belongs to New York. The philosophy and theology are decidedly American, the ethics are altogether of New York. We seem to trace half-a-dozen authors in Walt Whitman. The freedom and coarseness of his phraseology recal[l] Rabelais. In his most poetical passages he reminds us of Ossian. His philosophy has a flavour of Emerson; his constant display of independence and his peculiar habit of self-assertion, find no parallel save in George Wither; and his didactic breathings are in form, if in nothing else, at times suggestive of Tupper.</p><p>Leaves of Grass is a volume of nearly five hundred pages, of what the author considers and calls poetry. It is divided under several heads, the most important of which are 'Walt Whitman,' 'Chants Democratic,' 'Leaves of Grass' (which gives its title to the whole), 'Enfans d'Adam,' 'Calamus,' and 'Messenger Leaves.' All are alike in shape. Though called poems, the contents of the entire volume, one short passage in which the rhyme may be the result of accident excepted, have neither rhyme nor metre. The poems have a long rhythmic flow, which bears about the same relation to ordinary poetry that the military or mournful music of a savage tribe does to music as understood in Western Europe. The verses are of unequal length, ordinarily possessing a caesura and a strongly-marked accent on the penultimate syllable. This last quality is, however, not always observable. To quit form, however, and come to what is more important, matter, there are three pervading ideas in the volume, which may be described as the apotheosis of the flesh, the exaltation of states life, and the promotion of comradeship. To deal with these seriatim, in the first Whitman takes part in a natural and easily comprehensible reaction, signs of which have of late manifested themselves, against the extreme glorification of the soul at the expense of the body, which has been one of the results of Christianity. Heathen teaching held soul and body of equal account, and the Greek regarding each with equal reverence, was at as much pains to cultivate the powers of the one as is the other. The belief in the equality of the body with the soul largely pervades the writings of Whitman. Next to this comes his exaltation of democracy in general, and of American democracy in particular. Lastly comes the notion of comradeship. This last we only partially understand, and are not in the least tempted to enter upon. These are the views which first recal[l] themselves upon rising from the accomplished perusal of Leaves of Grass. A hundred other points, however, require mentioning ere we can profess to bring before the reader Walt Whitman as he really is. It is time, however, to give the reader a few quotations illustrative of the author's modes of thought. Fortunately, in so doing we give an insight into the nature of his verse also. We are obliged to be guarded in our selections. It is not possible to quote the passages which are in the fullest sense characteristic. Neither is it possible in the space we have allotted ourselves to give more than the feeblest conceivable idea of the nature of the contents of the remarkable book before us. Here are four lines in which the author describes himself:\u2014</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos.<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding,<br>No sentimentalist\u2014no stander above men and women, or apart <br>from men,<br>No more modest than immodest.'</p><p>He continues with wonderful worship of himself in lines from which we extract almost at random:\u2014</p><p>'I dote on myself\u2014there is that lot of me, and all so luscious,<br>Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with delight.<br>O, I am so wonderful!<br>I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the causes of my <br>faintest wish,<br>Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, not the cause of the friend-<br>ship I take again.<br>That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be.<br>That I eat and drink is spectacle enough for the great authors <br>and school.<br>A morning glory at my window satisfies me more than the meta-<br>physics of books.'</p><p>His general views may be gathered from one or two passage selected as illustrative of different phases of mind:\u2014</p><p>'I play not here marches for victors only; I play great marches <br>for conquered and slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say that it is good to fall\u2014battles are lost in the same spirit in <br>which they are won.<br>I beat triumphal drums for the dead.<br>I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest music to <br>them.<br>Vivas to those who have failed.<br>And to those whose war vessels sunk in the sea;<br>And those themselves who sank in the sea;<br>And to all generals that have lost engagements; and all over-<br>come heroes;<br>And the numberless unknown heroes, equal to the greatest heroes <br>known.'</p><p>His transcendentalism finds vent in the lines in which, after praising the discoveries of Positive science and singing hurra for all exact demonstrators, he continues:\u2014</p><p>'Gentlemen, I receive you and attach and clasp hands with <br>you.<br>The facts are useful and real\u2014they are not my dwelling\u2014I enter <br>by them to an area of the dwelling.'</p><p>His theology is continually obtruded:\u2014</p><p>'I do not despise you priests.<br>My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,<br>Enclosing all worship, ancient and modern, and all between <br>ancient and modern.'</p><p>Or again:\u2014</p><p>'And I call to mankind, be not curious about God,<br>For I, who am curious about each, am not curious about God.<br>No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God <br>and about death.<br>I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not <br>in the least.<br>Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each <br>moment then.<br>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face<br> in the glass.<br>I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is <br>signed by God's name.<br>And I leave them where they are, for I know that they will punc-<br>tually come for ever and ever.<br>And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to <br>try to alarm me.'</p><p>Again:\u2014</p><p>'I do not understand the realities of death, but I know they are <br>great.<br>I do not understand the least reality of life; how, then, can I un-<br>derstand the realities of death?'</p><p>The 'Chants Democratic' exalt everything American, the attributes of people and country alike, and are full of truly American exaggeration. They are far less interesting to English readers than the other portions of the volume. Everything American is the subject of his praises:\u2014</p><p>'These states are the amplest poem.<br>Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations.<br>Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of <br>the day and night.<br>Here is what moves in magnificent masses\u2014carelessly faithful <br>of particulars.<br>Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the <br>soul loves,'<br>Here the flowing trains\u2014here the crowds, equality, diversity, the <br>soul loves.'</p><p>He sings the American wherever he is found:\u2014</p><p>'Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or <br>Kennebec,<br>Dwellers in cabins among the California mountains or by the <br>little lakes or on the Columbia.<br>Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande\u2014friendly <br>gatherings, the characters and fun,<br>Dwellers up north in Minnesota and by the Yellow Stone River\u2014 <br>dwellers on coasts and off coasts, etc'</p><p>But we can extract no more. Our space forbids, and, inadequately as our task is accomplished, we must retire from it. Our readers have seen enough of the book to have an idea of it and the author. To know all his talent and eccentricity is impossible till the book itself has been perused. The contents of the volume can by a stretch only be called poetry. They lack its first and most indispensable element, beauty. They are, however, strange and most suggestive reading, and such as a man of culture will not care entirely to ignore. Spite of barbarous expressions, vile Americanisms, and all faults of thought and expression, the writings of Walt Whitman are full of character, and well worthy of contemplation. They will in time attain a certain measure of celebrity even, and their author is surely entitled to a distinct niche in American literature.

This faith Walt Whitman certainly has in an amazing degree; perhaps no man ever wrote with so much assurance and so regardless of the opinions of the mass of his contemporaries. In his recent little volume, called Drum Taps, occur these lines:\u2014</p><p>I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have been had all accepted me;<br> I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities, nor ridicule.</p><p>The following from Leaves of Grass is to the same purport:\u2014</p><p>Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port, though beaten back, and many times baffled;<br>Not the path-finder, penetrating inland, weary and long,<br>By deserts parched, snows chilled, rivers wet, perseveres till he reaches his destination,<br>More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose a free march for these States,<br>To be exhilarating music to them years, centuries hence.</p><p>He has worked away like a man building something, the plan or character of which none foresaw, but which he had deliberately settled upon; and amid the jeers and ridicule of the crowd has gone on adding stroke after stroke, part after part, as serenely and good-naturedly as if the rest of mankind were clapping their hands in applause.</p><p>As his work approaches, or perhaps has arrived at, completion in this new edition, it turns out that the thing he has been building so long is a man\u2014a new democratic man, whom he believes to be typical of the future American, and of whom he perpetually uses himself as the illustration.</p><p>The 'Inscription,' which is one of the new features of this edition, says as much:\u2014</p><p>Small is the theme of the following chant, yet the greatest\u2014namely, ONE'S SELF\u2014that wonderous thing, a simple, separate person. That, for the use of the New World, I sing.<br>Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse; I say the form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male, I sing.<br>Nor cease at the theme of One's Self.

And thus upon our journey link'd together let us go.</p><p>This passage, 'To a Historian,' also contains a valuable hint toward understanding the purpose of the author:\u2014</p><p>You who have celebrated bygones!<br>Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races \u2014the life that has exhibited itself;<br>Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers and priests;<br>I, habitu\u00e9 of the Alleghanies, treating man as he is in himself, in his own rights,<br>Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, (the great pride of man in himself;)<br>Chanter of personality, outlining what is yet to be, I project the history of the future.</p><p>The arrangement of the pieces, as they stand in the new volume, favors this view. The first poem, 'Walt Whitman,' which is a compend of the book, has for its central purpose, perhaps, to show how a man is made; what elements and experiences contribute to him, and how wide the field from which he may draw nutriment. It is a search after power\u2014a ransacking of heaven and earth for something to try himself on\u2014to measure himself against. He would soar into heaven, he would dive into hell, to find himself\u2014to be published of his own personality.</p><p>Following this poem comes a collection of pieces called 'Children of Adam,' in which the author celebrates amativeness and the principle of sex. It is these poems which have given so much offense. They have most likely been very much misunderstood. The poet attempts to do justice to every part of a strong, healthy, unconventional man. In these pieces he shows us his hero mostly as a breeding animal\u2014for the moment giving free swing to his animal nature. When we reflect that this animal nature is the basis of all else\u2014is the very ground under our feet\u2014we can pardon this attitude of the poet toward it, particularly as he has done an equal proportionate justice to the moral and aesthetic qualities, and has not unduly exalted any part.</p><p>The poems called 'Calamus,' which follow, celebrate a riper and more mature feeling, namely, manly affection and the need of comrades. 'Salut au monde,' or, Health to the World! shows the geniality and good wishes of America toward all other nations, till, in the pieces which follow, the high intellectual powers are fully recognized and unfolded:\u2014</p><p>I have said many times that materials and the soul are great, and that all depends on physique;<br>Now I reverse what I said, and affirm that all depends on the aesthetic, or intellectual,<br>And that criticism is great\u2014and that refinement is greatest of all;<br>And I affirm now that the mind governs\u2014and that all depends on the mind.</p><p>The 'Song of the Broad Axe' and 'To Working-Men' comprise most of those poems which, in other editions, were arranged under the head of 'Chants Democratic.' The Sun-down poem, which Thoreau admired so much, comes near the close of the volume. This poem represents the soul in an attitude of worship or adoration. Having examined the world and the men and women in it, having tasted and tried all things, it finds all perfect, and that there are and can be no conceivable failures:\u2014</p><p>Splendor of ended day, floating and filling me!<br>Hour prophetic\u2014hour resuming the past!<br>Inflating my throat\u2014you, divine average!<br>You, earth and life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.<br>Open mouth of my soul, uttering gladness,<br>Eyes of my soul, seeing perfection,<br>Natural life of me, faithfully praising things;<br>Corroborating forever the triumph of things.</p><p>The 'Song of the Open Road' shows the man about at maturity. It is a magnificent poem. The newer collection called Drum Taps, which this volume now includes, and which is the poet's latest work, comes near the close of the volume, as it ought. These poems, taken in connection with the author's services in the army-hospitals during the war, form a sort of coloring or atmosphere through which his entire work is to be read. Their chief feature is their humanity, and they are unspeakably precious in filling out and completing the idea of the work. They sanctify and make beautiful, like a great heroic act, everything in the author's previous life or previous poems.</p><p>Walt Whitman has at last justified himself. As he has surpassed all others in rude force and virility, he has surpassed all others in tenderness and love. All his 'hairy Pelasgic strength,' all his vast abysmal power, have at last blossomed into a benevolence such as was never before the inspiration of poems.</p>", "date": "November 10 1866", "year": 1866, "creator": "John Burroughs", "publication": "Boston Commonwealth", "citation": " Burroughs, John [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1867)].\" 10 November 1866.

He regards WALT WHITMAN as distinctively and transcendently the representative Poe of America-as holding to American literature the same relation as HOMER holds to Greek literature, DANTE to Italian, and SHAKESPEARE to English. Without denying the justice of this claim, certainly without questioning the sincerity and earnestness with which it is pressed by critics of eminence and ability, we may certainly be pardoned for saying that the study we have given to these writings, not profound nor complete, we admit, has not disclosed to us the grounds on which it can be vindicated and sustained. We do certainly recognize in some of WHITMAN'S poems, especially in those written since and upon the war, and notably in that noble, almost unrivalled hymn on the funeral procession of LINCOLN, beginning 'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,' some of the loftiest and most beautifully majestic strains ever sounded by human meditation. Perhaps these may and should give character to the whole, as it is the right of the artist to be judged by his best; but we have not yet come to believe that even these poems, grand as they are, justify the great claims put forth on their author's behalf. Nor can we fail to note that while he sometimes thus soars aloft in the very highest regions of thought and song, WALT WHITMAN often also wallows exultingly in unredeemed and irredeemable indecency and filth. His code of nature and of genius may justify him in thinking and feeling, and perhaps in writing, upon this level, but he has no right to expect that other men and women shall keep him company in so doing. Until the social circle, the dinner table and the fireside are deemed fitting theatres for every topic and for every set for which the sanction of Nature can be invoked, this volume cannot be accepted as fit for the audience which it seeks and claims. With this partial protest, we submit the able and interesting review of our contributor.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>There is a touch of comedy in the fact that, despite the roar of angry criticism which has met its former successive stages and appearances, another and a much fuller growth of this hardy volume has just made its appearance, challenging a notice at our hands, in addition to the two extensive ones given in past years in these columns.</p><p>It is certain that in this new edition the plan and theory of the author appear more distinctly and to greater advantage than before. The equal certainty of the great merits of the book, whatever its demerits may be, and the nobility of the writer's intentions and object, joined with his well-known career during the war, would seem to require of journalism not only respect, but the more favorable forms of interpretation; and this the writer can give, out of a long and hearty accretion of good-will toward the poem and its author, derived from repeated and deliberate scrutiny of both, extending through several years.</p><p>The book is, perhaps, the most astounding one of the age. It has much to perplex, much to cause widely different opinions. During its existence of ten years, it has called forth in high quarters vehement denunciation and even disgust; and again, from quarters equally high, defence and advocacy yet more vehement. It has not been left to itself, at any rate, and cannot be. It is widely known at home and abroad. It is read and appreciated in London, in Paris, in Rome, and there is a quiet yet real stratum of attention, and even devotion, to it in American society, which, though it does not often crop out into print, is nevertheless potent.</p><p>We have not, of course, the slightest wish to defend or excuse in these columns, what may, and from certain points of view, what must appear as serious blots upon the author's performance, as they must upon the works of HOMER, of SHAKESPEARE, of DANTE and JUVENAL; but we think it would be idle to deny that this is the only book in our literature which aims at a distinctively national character and a high classic importance and performance; and leaving the discussion of blemishes to others, aware that we perceive at least in some measure the reason for them in the work, let ours bet the pleasanter task of offering a few comments in the spirit of appreciative exposition or interpretation, which, after all, is the spirit that best becomes a critic.</p><p>The book, as just said, has been noticed before in these columns, but its general quality and character and the lodgment it has achieved, make fresh mention always proper; and moreover, the new arrangement and revision of this (the fourth) edition, and the copious additions of new verse, most of which relates to the war, give to it something of the character of an original publication.</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Evidences of a wide and multifarious learning, rather concealed than displayed, and oftenest dissolved into the intelligence; of a long and intimate experience of life and men, and a patient and loving study of things; and of a purpose, deep as existence and as earnest and fervent as ever inspired man, are what one sees readily upon first glancing over the volume. Add, as among the special gifts of the author, a singularly vivid and creative imagination, a quality of mind which perceives with sublest insight things in their simple verity, without coloring or exaggeration, a skill to command the higher harmonies of verse, and a mastery, truly wonderful, of all the resources of language.</p><p>The author is the third of note who appears as the central and paramount figure of his own creation. The first is DANTE. But throughout the scenery, terrific or celestial, of the Divina Comedia, the great Tuscan moves only pictorially or as an object. The second is MONTAIGNE. Here the presentation is not only of the corporeal appearance but of the mental being also, and the short, able-bodied old Gascon sits for us in his study, as STERLING has pictured him, conveyed to our perception by a series of sharp and daring strokes, and also merges at times into our consciousness, becoming our intellectual selves. In WALT WHITMAN'S treatment, with his Democratic philosophy of Egoism, there are points of analogy to MONTAIGNE'S, but the conception and presentation are for more relieved and vivid, besides being inclusive to a degree unprecedented in literature. In the art or plan of his book, like the others, he makes the central figure, but he appears not only physiognomically, but psychologically and physiologically. There is, perhaps, in poetry, no equal celebration of the human being in his completeness-in his organic character-every part necessary to every other and to the whole,\u2014a mutuality of means and ends. Spiritually, mentally, corporeally, a complete form, he glows, glorified in all his nature, upon the student of the volume. The reader seems to himself to be in company with some tremendous living man. There is an immense sense of space in the book. There is an equally immense spread of salient and world-wide scenery, and a sustained impression of time, as from birth to age and death. There is also a world of event, circumstance, vicissitude, the superb shows of peace, the tragic sceneries of war, and a swarm of personal hopes, dreams, observations, memories, speculations, prophecies, in which the highest themes are involved. But, through all the dazzling interradiation of sights and sounds, the pageant cosmorama of the nights and days, the gorgeous profusion of picturings, the swift and flashing cascading of thoughts, fancies, imaginations, images, poured forth with all the lavish richness of genius, the main figure of the organic man, complete, full-blooded, ample of body and soul, haughty, affectionate, electrical, powerfully projected in living form to the senses of the imagination, moves steadily with vivid prominence from beginning to end. The divine, the diabolic, the human, which are in all of us, are in him. The whole conception is in the highest spirit of that scientific verity which makes great poems. Its objects, as presented, are obvious. It aims to fix, in living art, an example, a model of manly being, operant upon the imaginations of men, for the use of the future of America, while, at the same time, it presents to the world, in one bold figure, the interpretation of the average historical American. Beyond this, it becomes a representative embodiment of the whole human nature, and seeks to express the cosmical character of the individual-yourself; the absolute miracle you are in all your parts from top to toe; your absolute sanctity; your wondrousness, eternity, priceless value; your centrality in the universe; all things, good and evil alike, being from your suppliance, your benefit, your development-in one word, the basic idea of Democracy.</p><p>This magnificent projection of the male also includes the female. And though it may be said that all the great works of absolute genius from VYASA and HOMER down, infer-as genius, which is another name for insight, must-the equality of woman with man, it is certain, and capable of the strictest demonstration, that never before has that equality been asserted in poetry till this volume, nor has woman ever met with a treatment so broadly and distinctly honorable. No more a toy, an invalid, a child, a fashion-plate, an odalisque, a gentle dependent, a delicate and charming subordinate, a caressed and courted being, without a flag or a land, she appears here adult; full grown; strong in her own right; powerful in womanly charms; manly and the equal of man; cultured, athletic and noble; crowned with the civic dignity; an American; a citizen; consubstantial with the pride, the ambition, the love and glory of her country. Wherever she appears in the book, she appears augustly. She is the matrix of all. As she is, so man is:</p><p>Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded, and is always to come unfolded;<br>Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the superbest man of the earth.</p><p>******</p><p>Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all justice is unfolded;<br>Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;<br>A man is a great thing upon the earth, and through all eternity\u2014but every jot of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman.</p><p>The same large justification of woman appears in this rich and tender Homeric picture:</p><p>Behold a woman.<br>She looks out from her Quaker cap\u2014her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.<br>She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch of the farm-house;<br>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen;<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-daughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.<br>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, and does not wish to go,<br>The justified mother of men!</p><p>What ideal of womanly character in literature reaches the sublime and severe height of this?</p><p>Her shape arises;<br>She, less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever;<br>The gross and soiled she moves among do not make her gross and soiled;<br>She knows the thoughts as she passes,nothing is concealed from her;<br>She is none the less considerate and friendly therefor;<br>She is the best beloved\u2014it is without exception\u2014she has no reason to fear, and she does not fear;<br>Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as she passes;<br>She is silent\u2014she is possess'd of herself\u2014they do not offend her;<br>She receives them as the laws of nature receive them\u2014she is strong;<br>She too is a law of nature\u2014there is no law stronger than she is.</p><p>The assertion of the august power and equality of the woman with the man is also involved in the grand statement, full of the spirit of America, which projects the ideal city:</p><p>Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards;<br>Where the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return, and understands them;<br>Where no monuments exist to heroes, but in the common words and deeds;<br>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place;<br>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws;<br>Where the slave ceases and the master of slaves ceases;<br>Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of elected persons;<br>Where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death pours it sweeping and unript waves;<br>Where outside authority enters always after the pre cedence of inside authority;<br>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal\u2014and President, Mayor, Governor, and what not, are agents for pay;<br>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves;<br>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs;<br>Where speculations on the soul are encouraged;<br>Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men;<br>Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;<br>Where the city of the faithfullest friends stands;<br>Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands;<br>Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands<br>Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands;<br>There the grand city stands.</p><p>The citation of these lines suggests what must strike every candid reader of the volume\u2014the absolute correspondence the latter bears in the form, substance and atmosphere with this country. The vast and often terrific energy, the electrifying or silent power, as of the thunder or the ray; the novel and colossal beauty which at every step startles and awes the appreciative student of these pages, are only signs and expressions of the close historic relation the book holds to the present of America. ' In history,' says Emerson, in one of his grandest passages, 'the great moment is when the savage is just ceasing to be a savage, with all his hairy pelasgic strength directed on the opening sense of beauty; and you have Pericles and Phidias, not yet passed over into the Corinthian civility. Everything good in nature and the world is in that moment of transition, when the swarthy juices still flow plentifully from nature, but their astringency or acidity is got out by ethics and humanity.' America, with her aboriginal forest just dissolving and mingled with the gorgeous shows of empire, evidences the arrival of this moment, and WALT WHITMAN is its expression in literature.</p><p>It is a prime characteristic of vast poems that their structure and quality involve the whole account of their respective countries. They contain all.</p><p>Give OWEN but one bone, and he will rebuild the vanished pterodactylus or the mastodon. Destroy every record, every fragment, and with Juvenal in his hand, NIEBUHR or BECKER will restore Rome. HOMER and ESCHYLUS incorporate Greece. HAFTZ is the soul of Persia. Under the vast banyan of Vyasa\u2014under the enormous fronds of the Makabharata\u2014spreads in gorgeous profusion of fact and dream, the life of India. LUCRETIUS contains antique Italy. SHAKESPEARE holds in precipitation England and Europe. CERVANTES includes Spain. All France is in RABELAIS. All Italy is in DANTE. In like manner, and with equal obviousness, WALT WHITMAN is a condensed encyclopedia of America. The universe, shadowed forth in his poems, is the background from which juts the tremen-alto-relievo of his country. If America sank tomorrow, and nothing survived on the float but this volume, the historian could tell the ages from its leaves, what was the nature and quality, the forms and shows, the essential verities of our democratic civilization.</p><p>This may not be perceived at first, though the fact is really a very plain one. Indeed, Mr. WHITMAN'S book may not be understood at all for a long time. Nature and Art alike often seem chaotic and incomprehensible, must receive patient consideration before they render up their meanings, and wait for ages for their interpretors. The physical cosmos cooled its heels a good while before HUMBOLDT arrived. It took two hundred years to understand SHAKESPEARE, whom the Germans finally excavated, making England a present of her own poet. No wonder if a similar fate is in store for the American man who has done what no one else thought worth doing, namely, celebrated his own country. But that he has done so, and that his book contains the whole theory of this nation, and has Democracy for its central thought, as Europe for her literature has Feudality, and proceeds solely, though with deference to the past, and to other civilizations, from the American historic movement, and faithfully and adequately mirrors the full life and vicissitude of this land and time, no candid and intelligent student of the work can fail to perceive. It is not the poem of a section or a locality, but of the whole Union. Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, California, are in it the same as New-York or New-England. It is good for any of our latitudes, implies them all, might have been written in any, only could not have been written abroad, and is the only one of our books which dislinks utterly from the principle, spirit and life of 'enemies' lands.' The lingering attachment of our seaboard to Europe is not in it. It breathes throughout the Western independence. In it appears for the first time in literature, that new fact, a regnant people\u2014the Americans, turbulent, generous, sovereign; their genius never expressed by their deputies, but always by themselves; the pulse of their life and rule not in any external influence or circumstance, but in their own developed love and pride. Its thought is everywhere the thought of Democracy\u2014the doctrine that everything is for the individual\u2014the theory that the office of society, government, the universe itself, is to produce great persons. All that DE TOCQUEVILLE attempted, with great success and partial failure, in analysis of American Democracy, WALT WHITMAN has triumphantly cast in poetic synthesis, sometimes in electric sentences of affirmation, sometimes in expressive dramatic or verbal pictures. No book we have could so possess a foreigner with a profound knowledge of this country and people, and the democratic passion which animates the whole. DE TOCQUEVILLE is a good spy-glass; but he who dwells resolutely in the atmosphere of Leaves of Grass, and masters its massive and subtle sense, will know America not from without like an observer, but from within like a citizen.</p><p>The thorough Americanism of the poem, permeating every part of it, appears as well in its literary form or rhythmus. This, not being capable of scansion by the laws of prosodies of antique Greece and Rome and modern Europe\u2014prosodies which ESCHYLUS, LUCRETIUS, DANTE and SHAKESPEARE accept only to violate whenever they choose\u2014has been pronounced unpoetical by reviewers who forget that poetry is a quality of thought mainly, and not a form of expression merely\u2014that poetry may even be in prose; and whose theory of poetical expression, logically carried out, would shove OSSIAN and HORACE, EZEKIEL and ISAIAH, and Davidic Psalms and the Song of SOLOMON, into the dust-bin of failures.</p><p>A catholic critic has to remember Lord BACON'S maxim, that 'in poetry, however some may tie themselves to the ancient forms, it is as lawful to devise new measures as new dances, and in these things the sense is a better judge than the art.' Opposed, too, to these gentlemen, we had not long ago an eminent English critic and Orientalist complimenting Mr. WHITMAN on the delicacy of his musical ear, and the melodiousness and beauty of his versification. The same critic assorted the similarity of the latter with that of the masterpieces of Persian poetry. The similarity is certainly apparent, as it also is to the poetic diction of the Hebraic muse, yet in both cases it is more apparent than real. The truth is, that the rhythmus of Leaves of Grass, with its occasional ruggedness, its often wild-bird melody, its always eolian and oceanic cadences, its novelty, flowing liquidity, audacity, simplicity, flexibility and liberty, is not merely an admirable and profoundly artistic form for the conveyance of epical intellections, whose glad and vast sublimity and rough grandeur would be illy expressed by the tintinnabluating minuets of Tennysonian metres, but is also a form corresponsive in all its qualities with the tumultuous, composite and gigantic life and movement of America. Apart from this, it is a rhythmus whose tally in nature is in the forms of trees or hills, the sweep and subsidence of billows, the cadences of winds, in which there is no regularity, but perfect harmony. In art, its analogy is in the complex and daring music of grand operas and symphonies-so unintelligible and unpleasing to persons whose ear is trained only to mere melody or tune. But the artist will own that the last secret of musical expression is realized in the 'Word Out of the Sea,' or in the unexcelled strains, sombre and wild and tender, and stirring the soul like a harmony of BEETHOVEN'S, in the grand dirge of LINCOLN, 'When Lilacs last in the Dooryard Bloomed,' in the sound as in the sense of which all requiems and hossanahs seem to blend.</p><p>How truly this sensitive and colossal poet has absorbed the spirit of this country, appears strikingly in the poems evoked by the war. The same august theory of democracy makes their inspiration, and solitary among all poems, singing of war, they conform to the spirit of the modern ages and to the genius of this land. The once permanent fact of civilization, the warrior, is not in them; instead appears the modern fact, the armed citizen. They celebrate no general, no leader, no master-brain, marshaling obedient hosts to conflict, for such Democracy has not seen and cannot see; they celebrate instead the immense truth\u2014a people rising as one man at the tap of the war-drum to fight for the idea of their land, and victory torn from the tremendous struggle simply and solely by the public spirit, the valor and endurance of the rank and file. And finally, they are greatest precisely where they have disappointed most and been most criticized\u2014viz., in their presentation of the war only in its tragic and ghastly aspects, or in those which develop the beautiful relations of patriotism and comradeship, or the spectacles of human love and sorrow; and also in their utter abstinence from any vindictiveness during the struggle, any note of exultation over the vanquished, or any feeling incompatible with the theory on which this country rests\u2014the permanent love and union of the whole people. The poet's view in these respects must be considered noble and profound; for war in the nineteenth century, always to be promptly undertaken for the good cause, must always be undertaken mournfully, and, as war, must always be regarded with sorrow; and those with whom we lately fought, however misguided, however bedeviled, were still our countrymen. The poet never forgets it. Utterly true to liberty and democracy, his is also true to country and humanity; and in the battle, the hospital, amidst the carnage, in scenes of loss and agony and horror, among the torn bodies of the dying and the dead, his spirit moves with the divine yearnings of maternity\u2014the Madonna tenderness, the mother's unutterable love and woe. Not what he, as the typical poet, brings America in the supreme hour of her triumph, when she stands, as he conceives her, stupendous and lovely in victory, and all the other poets are exulting:</p><p>Lo! Victress on the peaks!<br>Where thou standest, with mighty brow, regarding the world,<br>(The world, O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee;)<br>Out of its countless, beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all;<br>Where thou, dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,<br>Towerest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and bloom\u2014lo! in this hour supreme,<br>No poem proud, I, chanting, bring to thee\u2014nor mastery's rapturous verse;<br>But a little book, containing night's darkness, and blood-dripping wounds,<br>And psalms of the dead.</p><p>The picturesque side of the war gets full justice, as in pieces like 'Cavalry Crossing a Ford,' full of the very essence that makes HOMER immortal:</p><p>A line in long array, where they wind betwixt green islands;<br>They take a serpentine course\u2014their arms flash in the sun\u2014Hark to the musical clank;<br>Behold the silvery river\u2014in it the splashing horses, loitering, stop to drink;<br>Behold the brown-faced men\u2014each group, each person, a picture\u2014the negligent rest on the saddles;<br>Some emerge on the opposite bank\u2014others are just entering the ford;<br>The guidon flags flutter gaily in the wind.</p><p>Here every idiosyncrasy of the scene is caught, and makes the vividness and truth of the picture. So in pieces like 'The Veteran's Vision,' with its exciting glimpses of the engagement. But such scenes, and all that might tend to render the conflict attractive, are retired or veiled, as they should be, and the purely human element, utterly opposed to the devilish joy of battle, is kept in supremacy. Sometimes, as in 'By the Bivouac's Fitful Flame,' the thought moves to noble music in a soldier's reverie of home and the past and loved; sometimes, as in 'The Dresser,' the appalling scenery of the hospital opens; sometimes, as in the exquisite, sad idyl, 'Come up from the Fields, Father,' the commonest and keenest sorrow of the land finds voice; or we have some divine picture of the dead in camp or on the battle field; or the grand continental Western chant of progress and glory, 'Pioneers, O Pioneers!'\u2014or the rapt prophecy of the victory of the flag of man over the flag of kings; or a requiem, too noble for words, too beautiful for praise, like the 'Hymn for Dead Soldiers:</p><p>******</p><p>Faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet;<br>Draw close, but speak not.<p><p>Phantoms welcome, divine and tender,<br>Invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions;<br>Follow me ever! desert me not, while I live.<p><p>Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living! sweet are the musical voices surrounding!<br>But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes.</p><p>Dearest comrades! all now is over;<br>But love is not over\u2014and what love, O comrades!<br>Perfume from battle-fields rising\u2014up from foetor arising.</p><p>Perfume, therefore, my chant, O Love! immortal Love!<br>Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers.</p><p>Perfume all! make all wholesome!<br>O love! O chant! solve all with the last chemistry.</p><p>Give me exhaustless\u2014make me a fountain,<br>That I exhale love from me wherever I go,<br>For the sake of all dead soldiers.</p><p>The whole should be quoted. No elegy could be more exquisite. It is the very rapture of mournful and abiding love, and it is love consecrate of the people, so little remembered in the affection of poets. Yet the same cloud from which shines these tender moonlight rays, can let fly the rattling bursts of thunder which reverberate through such songs as that the poet sings 'By Blue Ontario's Shore'\u2014a poem whose interpretation of America is fitly matched by the majesty and passion of its diction. Look at this tremendous tableau of Libertad with Slavery beneath her:</p><p>Lo! high-toward Heaven, this day,<br>Libertad! from the conqueress' field returned,<br>I mark the new aureols around your head;<br>No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,<br>With war's flame, and the lambent lightnings playing<br>And your port immovable where you stand<br>With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted fist<br>And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly crush'd beneath you;<br>The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;<br>Lo! The wide-swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so much!<br>To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth,<br>An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurned.</p><p>Not less powerful and grand is this annunciation of the mission of poets:</p><p>For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals;<br>For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,<br>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.</p><p>Without extinction is Liberty! Without retrograde is Equality!<br>They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;<br>Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always ready to fall for Liberty.</p><p>For the great Idea!<br>For that we live, my brethren\u2014that is the mission of Poets.</p><p>With their poems of stern defiance, ever ready,<br>With songs of the rapid arming and the march,<br>And the flag of peace quick folded, and the song, instead, of the flag we know,<br>The flag of the youths and veterans\u2014flaunting flag,<br>Warlike flag of the great Idea!</p><p>Angry cloth I saw there leaping!<br>I stand again in the leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;<br>I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight\u2014O, the hard-contested fight!<br>O, the cannons ope their rosy-slashing muzzles! the hurtled balls scream!<br>The battle-front forms amid the smoke\u2014the volleys pour incessant from the line;<br>Hark! the ringing word, Charge! Now the tussle, and the furious, maddening yells,<br>Now the corpses tumble curled upon the ground,<br>Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,<br>Angry cloth I saw there leaping!</p><p>It is the flag of the great idea\u2014it is the Stars and Stripes\u2014which commands and owns all. The wonder is to see a patriotism so fervid and absolute united with such a breadth of universal and purely human sympathies. Patriotism is commonly pitiless; yet mark the heavenly compassion and acceptance of the poet's attitude over the dead enemy in the poem spanned by the word 'Reconciliation.'</p><p>Word over all, beautiful as the sky!<br>Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly lost;<br>That the hands of the sisters Death and Might, incessantly softly wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world.</p><p>For my enemy is dead\u2014a man divine as myself is dead;I look where he lies, white-faced and still in the coffin\u2014I draw near;I bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.</p><p>These are the strains to have produced which sweetens and ennobles victory. The thought of the comradeship of Americans is never absent from the poet's pages. Upon that he relies for the perpetuation of the Union. With love he will make the continent indissoluble. While others foster institutions with jealous care, he will make 'the institution of the dear love of comrades.' He proposes and predicts as the vital bond of America 'a superb friendship, exalte, previously unknown.' His dream is of a land of lovers and of friends. His statecraft is to saturate the imagination of the people with the thought of continental comradeship. Paper agreements, the lawyers, the puissance of arms, he sees cannot hold us together; only love. To inspire his countrymen with this is a central purpose of his volume. In this he believes, and even in the mad roar of civil slaughter his prophetic soul rises in magnificent and flowing music:</p><p>Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,<br>Be not disheartened\u2014affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet;<br>Those who love each other shall become invincible\u2014they shall yet make Columbia victorious.</p><p>Sons of the Mother of All! you shall yet be victorious!<br>You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of the remainder of the earth.</p><p>No danger shall baulk Columbia's lovers;<br>If need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.</p><p>One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade;<br>From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another, an Organese, shall be friends triune.<br>More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.</p><p>To Michigan Florida perfumes shall tenderly come;<br>Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death!</p><p>It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection;<br>The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly;<br>The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,<br>The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.</p><p>These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron;<br>I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! With the love of lovers tie you!</p><p>The German scholar, HEEBEN, finds in the Iliad of HOMER the bond that held together the States of Ancient Hellas. He is right, for the great poet alone is strong to give cohesion to a nation. Not substances, but phantoms lord it over us. Poland, dismembered by Europe, her every material interest involved in the Panslavic theory, which would bind her to Russia, resists resolutely, because, evoked from the heart of every Pole, towers one spectre, mournful and radiant, the august conception of nationality. Such are the ghosts that we own as sovereign. Arguments of adamant, logic of iron, defend and attack the doctrine of secession; and the mere intellect might wage the war forever. Behold! the light of a poetic thought is flung upon this square of bunting\u2014it is a cloth no longer, but a flag; and in defence of it, Northerner and Southerner will vie with each other which shall die nearest the foe! Out of all things, the bard evokes the insubstantial phantom of a common country, clothed with the glory and beauty of motherhood, and the pulses of strong men tremble with instinctive devotion, and the famed doctrine of secession become a strengthless film! 'Man,' said NAPOLEON, 'is ruled by his imagination.' It is true, and let it be so in no degrading sense, for it is through the imagination that high truths are perceived. The conception of country is one of them. It must remain an enduring part of the glory of our poet, that, as in such superb and powerful lines as we have quoted, he has bent all the force of his genius to strengthen this conception; to reinforce the great doctrines of the Republic, in all their sternness and tenderness; to make every alien or hostile face in the likeness of the ideal America; and that he has striven by sowing broadcast the strong thoughts and imaginings which spring up again in the forms of countrymen and lovers, to give to the States of America the cohesion and union HOMER gave to the States of the Hellenic confederacy.</p><p>W.D.O'C.</p>", "date": "December 2 1866", "year": 1866, "creator": "William Douglas O'Connor", "publication": "The New York Times", "citation": "O'Connor, William Douglas [listed as W.

We understand it to be a collection of Walt Whitman's previous works, 'Leaves of Grass,' and 'Drum-taps,' with the addition of a work containing much that has not been before printed, entitled 'Songs before Parting.' A careful perusal of these remarkable productions has convinced us that the vague impression we have now and then encountered that Walt Whitman is a kind of 'learned pig' is far from correct; we cannot pretend to name his species exactly, but it is certainly winged. That there is genius in these poems is unquestionable; yet it is difficult to assign their author any place in literature, unless, indeed, one may assume the veracity of metempsychosis, and say that here is Hafiz again, only drunk now with Catawba wine instead of the Saoma, and worshipping the Mississippi river instead of the Saravati, which, having dried up in Persia, may be supposed to have also transmigrated westward. Here is the lofty optimism of Hafiz preferring dust-grains to pearls, and his audacity believing that he will gain Paradise only by not shunning hell. And indeed there are some poems of Whitman's in which he seems to yearn towards the East from a westward outlook, as if he were more akin to it than to what America has inherited from Europe. Here is a brief example:\u2014</p><p>'Facing west from California's shores,<br>Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,<br>I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,<br> the land of migrations, look afar,<br>Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;<br>For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of <br>Kashmere,<br>From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,<br>From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,<br>Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,<br>Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,<br>(But where is what I started for so long ago?<br>And why is it yet unfound?)'</p><p>Nevertheless, the Orientalism of the book is manifestly unconscious, it is really meant to be, and is, intensely American. It is but just, however, to say that the America it celebrates is a transcendental one, related to the world and the distant stars, and not 'Uncle Sam's' fenced-in national farm. He sends a health to the world from himself and America\u2014</p><p>'O vapours! I think I have risen with you, and moved <br>away to distant continents, and fallen down there <br>for reasons;<br>I think I have blown with you, O winds;<br>O waters, I have fingered every shore with you.'</p><p>Comparing this volume with the earlier editions of the 'Leaves of Grass' we find that whilst all is retained, including some things that might better have been omitted, there is an entire rearrangement of the pieces, which greatly helps the reader who would find out just what are the central ideas under whose inspiration they have been composed. It is plain that, though the form is often chaotic, the work has a character as a whole. The poems may be classified as celebrations, first, of the individual, and next, of the mass. 'My days I sing, and the land's:' this is the key-note. Himself stands for every individual, and America sums up all lands and ages. That universalism which Mr. Hepworth Dixon found to be the all-pervading element of the Churches and communities of America means much more with Walt Whitman than the future restoration of the wicked, as the following sentences will show:\u2014</p><p>'I believe in the flesh and the appetites;<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me <br>is a miracle.<br>Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am <br>touched from.</p><p>'I dote on myself\u2014there is that lot of me and all so luscious;<br>Each moment, and whatever happens thrills me with joy,<br>O, I am wonderful!<br>I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my <br>faintest wish,<br>Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friend- <br>ship I take again.<br>That I walk up my stoop!

He is never weary of celebrating the 'love of comrades,' the 'boys together singing,' the friends' 'hand in hand.' This is the soul of democracy.

There are also swamps and deserts to be passed through, and long stretches of the names of places and occupations which are evidently condensed poems to the author, but which become as hard to get over as Brighton shingles to the ordinary reader. It has, indeed, something of the vastness of the succession of objects in nature, as a forest or savannah, but one does not like to get lost even in forest sublimities. Nevertheless, we have no apprehension that any one with eyes who shall read this volume, will fail to place a very high value upon it. Much has been said of its coarseness. There are, indeed, a few-a very few-portions of it which are coarse, and there are others which, without being coarse, are plain-spoken to a degree not generally permitted to contemporaries, though sometimes praised in ancient books. Whatever may be said of the passages to which we refer, this at least should we say, that they are not written in any defiant or destructive spirit.</p><p>We many notice here that among the young Americans whom this strange poet or prophet has inspired, one, Mr. John Burroughs, has written an interesting account of him, the advance sheets of which a friend has kindly placed in our hands. The following extracts will doubtless interest our readers:\u2014</p><p>'On his father's side his stock is English; on his mother's, Holland-Dutch. From his father he inherits his large frame and muscular build, his antecedents here being a race of farmers and mechanics, silent, good-natured, playing no high part in society, politics, or the Church, and noted chiefly for strength and size. His early life was passed partly in Brooklyn and partly in the country about forty miles east of Brooklyn, where he lived much in presence of the sea. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty he seems to have been mostly engaged in teaching country schools in his native town and vicinity. It was about this time that he began writing for the press. His first productions, mostly sketches, appeared in the Democratic Review, from which they were copied into some of the newspapers. Between the ages of twenty and thirty he was variously occupied as writer and editor on the press of New York and Brooklyn, sometimes going into the country and delivering political addresses. During this period he was on familiar terms of acquaintance with William Cullen Bryant, and the two were in the habit of taking long walks, which, of course, were equivalent to long talks, in and about Brooklyn. In 1850 he went to New Orleans in the capacity of editor, where he remained a year. On his trip to and from that city he made it a point penetrate various parts of the West and South-west, particularly to explore the Mississippi and its tributaries, searching, one might say, for hints and models to be used in the making of his poems.</p><p>'He does not seem to have conceived the idea of writing 'Leaves of Grass' till after his thirtieth year. How he was led to adopt this style of expression, thoroughly versed as he was in the literature of the day, is uncertain. The most probable explanation is that he felt hampered by the old forms and measures, and saw that if America ever came to possess a style of her own, it would be in the direction of more freedom and scope-a feeling in which many of his contemporaries are beginning to share. For three or four years before he began to write in this vein, and while his loaf was leavening, as it were, he was a diligent student of the critical literature of the age, delving into foreign magazines and quarterly reviews, and collecting a vast amount of matter, bearing upon poetry and literature generally, for further use and study. It is quite probable that this course of reading had some influence in determining his own course as a poet, and that he knew well beforehand wherein the head and front of his work would lie. It has not been with his eyes shut that he set himself against the popular tastes and standards, and wrote for an audience of which he did not count upon the present existence of a single member. It cannot be said with the same force of any other writer, living or dead, that he must 'wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of himself.'</p><p>'When 'Leaves of Grass' was written and published, the author was engaged in putting up small frame-houses in the suburbs of Brooklyn, partially with his own hands and partly with hired help. The book was still-born. To a small job printing-office in that city belongs the honour, if such, of bringing it to light. Some threescore copies were deposited in a neighboring book-store, and as many more in another book-store in New York. Weeks elapsed, and not one was sold. Presently there issued reports from both the stores that the thin quarto, for such it was, should be forthwith removed. The copies found refuge in a well-known phrenological publishing house in Broadway, whose proprietors advertised it and sent specimen copies to the journals and to some distinguished persons. The journals remained silent, and several of the volumes sent to the distinguished persons were returned with ironical and insulting notes. The only attention the book received was, for instance, the use of it by the collected attach\u00e9s of a leading daily paper of New York, when at leisure, as a butt and burlesque-its perusal aloud by one of the party being equivalent to peals of ironical laughter from the rest.</p><p>'A small but important occurrence seems to have turned the tide. This was the appearance of a letter from the most illustrious literary man in America, brief, but containing a magnificent eulogium of the book. A demand arose, and before many months, all the copies of the thin quarto were sold. At the present date, a curious person, pouring over the shelves of second-hand book stalls in side places of the city, may light upon a copy of this quarto, for which the stall-keeper will ask him treble its first price.'</p><p>We feel a certain responsibility in alluding to this strange work; but there is that in it, with all its eccentricity and vagueness, which removes it from the category of common-place books, and places it among those of which a critic is bound to give a fair and impartial account. It is unfortunate that this odd poet should have spoiled so much beautiful work with even one smear of nastiness; but however we may regret his having done so, we cannot afford to lose what he has given us because he has not given it in a purer spirit. He is far more chaste than Mr. Swinburne, whom he resembles in many particulars; he is not more irreverent than Shelley; he is in some points more dramatic than either, and far less hurtful. There is a wild, natural exuberance of animalism displayed by Whitman of a thoroughly original kind, an open-air abandonment, a weird and exalted receptivity embracing the good and the bad, the vice and the virtue of life, with a power and comprehensiveness as striking as it is novel. If he will but learn to tame a little, America will at last have a genuine American poet.</p><p>We are not defending Whitman's audacity, nor maintaining that a poet may run counter to every social and religious belief and law, because he is a poet; but genius is too rare and too precious a gift to the world to be lost and forgotten simply on the score of its raving at times. Besides, Whitman removes grossness out of the reach of passion, renders it completely unsuggestive or alluring by his uncovered and unornamented distinctiveness. We have read leading articles in newspapers far more subversive of nicety in modest thought than the worst of Whitman's erotics, if erotics we can term his rhapsodical worship of form and flesh. At the same time Whitman is not a poet for the family circle, nor is his book one which could be allowed into everybody's hands. Taking 'Leaves of Grass' on the whole, we have no hesitation in pronouncing them to be leaves containing noble and sublime images-leaves in which there is a throbbing and real pulse of that great sympathy which indicates the poet, and for which we are disposed to forgive a taint of earthiness and mould which may in a future edition be removed.</p>", "date": "June 8 1867", "year": 1867, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The London Review and Weekly Journal of Politics", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman.\" 8 June 1867.

Luckily, the man is strong enough, sane enough, to take both abuse and panegyric with calmness. He believes hugely in himself, and in the part he is destined to take in American affairs. He is neither to be put down by prudes, nor tempted aside by the serenade of pipes and timbrels. A large, dispassionate, daring, and splendidly-proportioned animal, he remains unmoved, explanatory up to a certain point, but sphinx-like when he is questioned too closely on morality or religion. Yet when the enthusiastic and credulous, the half-formed, the inquiring, youth of a nation begin to be carried away by a man's teachings, it is time to inquire what these teachings are; for assuredly they are going to exercise extraordinary influence on life and opinion. Now, it is clear, on the best authority, that the writer in question is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates\u2014his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. What the man is, and what the ministry implies, it will not take long to explain. Let it be admitted at the outset, however, that we are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capability for good.</p><p>Sprung from the masses, as he himself tells us, Walt Whitman has for many years lived a vagabond life, labouring, as the humour seized him, and invariably winning his bread by actual and persistent industry. He has been alternately a farmer, a carpenter, a printer. He has been a constant contributor of prose to the Republican journals. He appears, moreover, at intervals, to have wandered over the North American continent, to have worked his way from city to city, and to have consorted liberally with the draff of men on bold and equal conditions. Before the outbreak of the war, he was to be found dwelling in New York, on \u2018fish-shape Paumanok,\u2019 basking there in the rays of the almost tropical sun, or sallying forth into the streets to mingle with strange companions\u2014from the lodging-house luminary and the omnibus driver, down to the scowling rowdy of the wharf bars. Having written his first book, \u2018Leaves of Grass,\u2019 he set it up with his own hands, in a printing-office in Brooklyn. Some of our readers may dimly remember how the work was briefly noticed by contemporary English reviews, in a way to leave the impression that the writer was a wild maniac, with morbid developments in the region of the os pelvis. On the outbreak of the great rebellion, he followed in the rear of the great armies, distinguishing himself by unremitting attention to the wounded in the Ambulance Department, until, on receiving a clerkship in the Department of the Interior, he removed to Washington. Here, to the great scandal of American virtue, he continued to vagabondize as before, but without neglecting his official duties. At the street corner, at the drinking-bar, in the slums, in the hospital wards, the tall figure of Walt Whitman was encountered daily by the citizens of the capital. He knew everybody, from the President down to the crossing-sweeper.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 said Abraham Lincoln, watching him as he stalked by, \u2018he looks like a man.\u2019</p><p>Latterly, his loafing propensities appear to have grown too strong for American tolerance, and he was ejected from his clerkship, on the pretext that he had written \u2018indecent verses,\u2019 and was a \u2018free lover.\u2019 His admirers, indignant to a man at this treatment, have accumulated protest upon protest, enumerating numberless instances of his personal goodness and self-denial, and laying powerful emphasis on certain deeds which, if truly chronicled, evince a width of sympathy and a private influence unparalleled, perhaps, in contemporary history. With all this personal business we have no concern. His admirers move for a new trial on the evidence of his written works, and to that evidence we must proceed.</p><p>In about ten thousand lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence, Walt Whitman professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man, and, more particularly, indicating the great elements which distinguish American freedom from the fabrics erected by European politicians. Starting from Paumanok, where he was born, he takes mankind in review, and sees everywhere but one wondrous life\u2014the movement of the great masses, seeking incessantly under the sun for guarantees of personal liberty. He respects no particular creed, admits no specific morality prescribed by the civil law, but affirms in round terms the universal equality of men, subject to the action of particular revolutions, and guided en masse by the identity of particular leaders. The whole introduction is a reverie on the destiny of nations, with an undertone of forethought on the American future, which is to contain the surest and final triumph of the democratical man. A new race is to arise, dominating previous ones, and grander far, with new contests, new politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts. But how dominating? By the perfect recognition of individual equality, by the recognition of the personal responsibility and spiritual significance of each being, by the abrogation of distinctions such as set barriers in the way of perfect private action\u2014action responsible only to the being of whom it is a consequence, and inevitably controlled, if diabolic, by the combined action of masses.</p><p>Briefly, Walt Whitman sees in the American future the grandest realization of centuries of idealism\u2014equable distribution of property, luminous enlargement of the spiritual horizon, perfect exercise of all the functions; no apathy, no prudery, no shame, none of that worst absenteeism wherein the soul deserts its proper and ample physical sphere, and sallies out into the regions of the impossible and the unknown. Very finely, indeed, does the writer set forth the divine functions of the body\u2014the dignity and the righteousness of a habitation existing only on the condition of personal exertion; and faintly, but truly, does he suggest how from that personal exertion issues spirituality, fashioning literatures, dreaming religions, and perfecting arts. \u2018I will make,\u2019 he exclaims, \u2018the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems; and I will make the poems of my body and of mortality: for I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.\u2019</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Having broadly premised, describing the great movements of masses, Walt Whitman proceeds, in a separate \u2018poem\u2019 or \u2018book,\u2019 to select a member of the great democracy, representing typically the privileges, the immunities, the conditions, and the functions of all the rest. He cannot, he believes, choose a better example than himself so he calls this poem \u2018Walt Whitman.\u2019 He is for the time being, and for poetical purposes, the cosmical Man, an entity, a representative of the great forces.\u2020 He describes the delight of his own physical being, the pleasure of the senses, the countless sensations through which he communicates with the material universe. All, he says, is sweet\u2014smell, taste, thought, the play of his limbs, the fantasies of his mind; every attribute is welcome, and he is ashamed of none. He is not afraid of death; he is content to change, if it be the nature of things that he should change, but it is certain that he cannot perish. He pictures the pageant of life in the country and in cities; all is a fine panorama, wherein mountains and valleys, nations and religions, genre, pictures and gleams of sunlight, babes on the breast and dead men in shrouds, pyramids and brothels, deserts and populated streets, sweep wonderfully by him. To all those things he is bound:\u2014wherever they force him, he is not wholly a free agent; but on one point he is very clear\u2014that, so far as he is concerned, he is the most important thing of all. He has work to do; life is not merely a suck or a sell; nay, the whole business of ages has gone on with one object only\u2014that he, the democrat, Walt Whitman, might have work to do. In these very strange passages, he proclaims the magnitude of the preparations for his private action:\u2014</p><p>\u2018Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?</p><p>What is a man, anyhow? What am I? What are you?</p><p>All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own,Else it were time lost listening to me.</p><p>I do not snivel that snivel the world over, <br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth; <br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare <br>crape, and tears.</p><p>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids\u2014conformity goes to <br>the forth-removed; <br>I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out.</p><p>Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?</p><p>Having pried through the strata, analysed to a hair, counsel'd with doctors, and <br>calculated close, <br>I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.</p><p>In all people I see myself\u2014none more, and not one a barleycorn less; <br>And the good or bad I say of myself, I say of them.</p><p>And I know I am solid and sound; <br>To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow; <br>All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.</p><p>I know I am deathless; <br>I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter's compass; <br>I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.</p><p>I know I am august; <br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or be understood; <br>I see that the elementary laws never apologize; <br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)</p><p>I exist as I am\u2014that is enough; <br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content; <br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content.</p><p>One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself; <br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million years, <br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p><p>My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite; <br>I laugh at what you call dissolution; <br>And I know the amplitude of time.</p><br><p>I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I am an encloser of things to be.</p><p>My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs; <br>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps; <br>All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.</p><p>Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me; <br>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing\u2014I know I was even there; <br>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist, <br>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.</p><p>Long I was hugg'd close\u2014long and long.</p><p>Immense have been the preparations for me, <br>Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.</p><p>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen; <br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings; <br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.</p><p>Before I was born out of my mother, generations guided me; <br>My embryo has never been torpid\u2014nothing could overlay it.</p><p>For it the nebula cohered to an orb, <br>The long slow strata piled to rest it on, <br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance, <br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths, and deposited it with care</p><p>All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me; <br>Now on this spot I stand with my robust Soul.</p><p>It is impossible in an extract to convey an idea of the mystic and coarse, yet living, force which pervades the poem called \u2018Walt Whitman.\u2019 We have chosen an extract where the utterance is unusually clear and vivid. But more extraordinary, in their strong sympathy, are the portions describing the occupations of men. In a few vivid touches we have striking pictures; the writer shifts his identity like Proteus, but breathes the same deep undertone in every shape. He can transfer himself into any personality, however base. \u2018I am the man\u2014I suffered\u2014I was there.\u2019 He cares for no man's pride. He holds no man unclean.</p><p>And afterwards, in the poem called \u2018Children of Adam,\u2019 he proceeds to particularize the privileges of flesh, and to assert that in his own personal living body there is no uncleanness. He sees that the beasts are not ashamed; why, therefore, should he be ashamed? Then comes passage after passage of daring animalism; the functions of the body are unhesitatingly described, and the man asserts that the basest of them is glorious. All the stuff which offended American virtue is to be found here. It is very coarse, but, as we shall see, very important. It is never, however, inhuman; indeed, it is strongly masculine\u2014unsicklied by Lesbian bestialities and Petronian abominations. It simply chronicles acts and functions which, however unfit for art, are natural, sane, and perfectly pure. We shall attempt to show further on that Walt Whitman is not an artist at all, not a poet, properly so called; and that this grossness, offensive in itself, is highly significant\u2014an essential part of very imperfect work. The general question of literary immorality need not be introduced at all. No one is likely to read the book who is not intelligently chaste, or who is not familiar with numberless authors offensive to prudes\u2014Lucretius, Virgil, Dante, Goethe, Byron, among poets; Tacitus, Rabelais, Montaigne, Cervantes, Swedenborg, among prose thinkers.</p><p>The remainder of \u2018Leaves of Grass\u2019 is occupied with poems of democracy, and general monotonous prophecies. There is nothing more which it would serve our present purpose to describe in detail, or to interpret. The typical man continues his cry, encouraging all men,\u2014on the open road, in the light of day, in the region of dreams. All is right with the world, he thinks. For religion he advises, \u2018Reverence all things\u2019; for morality, \u2018Be not ashamed\u2019; for political wisdom among peoples, \u2018Resist much\u2014obey little.\u2019 He has no word for art; it is not in her temple that he burns incense. His language, as even a short extract has showed, is strong, vehement, instantaneously chosen; always forcible, and sometimes even rhythmical, like the prose of Plato. Thoughts crowd so thick upon him, that he has no time to seek their artistic equivalent; he utters his thought in any way, and his expressions gain accidental beauty from the glamour of his sympathy. As he speaks, we more than once see a man's face at white heat, and a man's hand beating down emphasis at the end of periods. He is inspired, not angry; yet as even inspiration is not infallible, he sometimes talks rank nonsense.</p><p>The second part of the volume, \u2018Drum-Taps,\u2019 is a series of poetic soliloquies on the war. It is more American and somewhat less mystical than the \u2018Leaves of Grass\u2019; but we have again the old cry of democracy. Here, in proportion to the absence of self-consciousness, and the presence of vivid emotion, we find absolute music, culminating once or twice in poetry. The monody on the death of Lincoln\u2014\u2019when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed\u2019\u2014contains the three essentials of poetic art\u2014perfect vision, supreme emotion, and true music. This, however, is unusual in Walt Whitman. Intellectual self-consciousness generally coerces emotion, insincerities and follies ensue, and instead of rising into poetry, the lines wail monotonously, and the sound drops into the circle of crabbed prose.</p><p>For there is this distinction between Walt Whitman and the poet\u2014that Whitman is content to reiterate his truth over and over again in the same tones, with the same result; while the poet, having found a truth to utter, is coerced by his artistic sympathies into seeking fresh literary forms for its expression. \u2018Bawling out the rights of man,\u2019 wrote Horne Tooke, \u2018is not singing.\u2019 Artistic sympathies Walt Whitman has none; he is that curiously-crying bird\u2014a prophet with no taste. He is careless about beautifying his truth: he is heedless of the new forms\u2014personal, dramatic, lyrical\u2014in which another man would clothe it, and in which his disciples will be certain to clothe it for him. He sees vividly, but he is not always so naturally moved as to sing exquisitely. He has the swagger of the prophet, not the sweetness of the musician. Hence all those crude metaphors and false notes which must shock artists, those needless bestialities which repel prudes, that general want of balance and that mental dizziness which astonish most Europeans.</p><p>But when this has been said, all blame has been said, if, after all, a man is to incur blame for not being quite another sort of being than nature made him. Walt Whitman has arisen on the States to point the way to new literatures. He is the plain pioneer, pickaxe on shoulder, working and \u2018roughing.\u2019 The daintier gentlemen will follow, and build where he is delving.</p><p>Whitman himself would be the first to denounce those loose young gentlemen who admire him vaguely because he is loud and massive, gross and colossal, not for the sake of the truth he is teaching, and the grandeur of the result that may ensue. There are some men who can admire nothing unless it is \u2018strong\u2019; intellectual dram-drinkers, quite as far from the truth as sentimental tea-drinkers. Let it at once and unhesitatingly be admitted that Whitman's want of art, his grossness, his tall talk, his metaphorical word-piling, are faults\u2014prodigious ones; and then let us turn reverently to contemplate these signs which denote his ministry, his command of rude forces, his nationality, his manly earnestness, and, last and greatest, his wondrous sympathy with men as men. In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. He emerges from the mass of unwelded materials\u2014in shape much like the Earth-spirit in Faust. He is loud and coarse, like most prophets, \u2018sounding,\u2019 as he himself phrases it, \u2018his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\u2019 He is the voice of which America stood most in need\u2014a voice at which ladies scream and gigmen titter, but which clearly pertains to a man who means to be heard. He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied, but not perhaps to be beheld till the vast American democracy has subsided a little from its last and grandest struggle. Honour in his generation is of course his due, but he does not seem to solicit honour. He is too thoroughly alive to care about being tickled into activity, too excited already to be much moved by finding himself that most badgered of functionaries, the recognized Sir Oracle.</p><p>Walt Whitman's \u2018Leaves of Grass,\u2019 \u2018Drum-Taps,\u2019 etc New York, 1867. </p></p>Let it be understood, here and elsewhere, that we shall attach our own significance to passages in themselves sufficiently mystical.

His 'unconventionality,' as a critic well said two or three years ago, 'is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them.'

For a moment one wonderingly inquires after the cause of this seeming neglect. The New World, with its new presentations to the senses, its new ideas and passions, its new social tendencies and habits, must surely, one thinks, have given birth to literary and artistic forms corresponding to itself in strange novelty, unlike in a remarkable degree those sprung from our Old-world, and old-world hearts. A moral soil and a moral climate so different from those of Europe must surely have produced a fauna and flora other than the European, a fauna and flora which the writers of literary natural history cannot but be curious to classify, and the peculiarities of which they must endeavour to account for by the special conditions of existence and of the development of species in the new country. It is as much to be expected that poems and pictures requiring new names should be found there as that new living things of any other kind, the hickory and the hemlock, the mocking bird and the katydid, should be found. So one reasons for a moment, and wonders. The fact is, that while the physical conditions, fostering certain forms of life, and repressing others, operated without let or hindrance, and disclosed themselves in their proper results with the simplicity and sureness of nature, the permanent moral powers were met by others of transitory or local, but, for the time, superior authority, which put a hedge around the literature and art of America, enclosing a little paradise of European culture, refinement, and aristocratic delicatesse from the howling wilderness of Yankee democracy, and insulating it from the vital touch and breath of the land, the winds of free, untrodden places, the splendour and vastness of rivers and seas, the strength and tumult of the people. Until of late indigenous growths of the New World showed in American literature like exotics, shy or insolent. We were aware of this, and expected in an American poet some one who would sing for us gently, in a minor key, the pleasant airs we knew. Longfellow's was a sweet and characteristic note, but, except in a heightened enjoyment of the antique\u2014a ruined Rhine castle, a goblet from which dead knights had drunk, a suit of armour, or anything frankly medieval\u2014except in this, Longfellow is one of ourselves\u2014an European. 'Evangeline' is an European idyl of American life, Hermann and Dorothea having emigrated to Acadie. 'Hiawatha' might have been dreamed in Kensington by a London man of letters who possessed a graceful idealizing turn of imagination, and who had studied with clear-minded and gracious sympathy the better side of Indian character and manners. Longfellow could amiably quiz, from a point of view of superior and contented refinement, his countrymen who went about blatant and blustering for a national art and literature which should correspond with the large proportions and freedom of the Republic. 'We want,' cries Mr. Hathaway in 'Kavanagh', 'a national drama, in which scope enough shall be given to our gigantic ideas, and to the unparalleled activity and progress of our people\u2026. We want a national literature, altogether shaggy and unshorn, that shall shake the earth, like a herd of buffaloes, thundering over the prairies!' And Mr. Churchill explains that what is best in literature is not national but universal, and is the fruit of refinement and culture. Longfellow's fellow-countryman, Irving, might have walked arm-in- arm with Addison, and Addison would have run no risk of being discomposed by a trans-Atlantic twang in his companion's accent. Irving, if he betrays his origin at all, betrays it somewhat in the same way as Longfellow, by his tender, satisfied repose in the venerable, chiefly the venerable in English society and manners, by his quiet delight in the implicit tradition of English civility, the scarcely-felt yet everywhere influential presence of a beautiful and grave Past, and the company of unseen beneficent associations. In Bryant, Europe is more in the background; prairie and immemorial forest occupy the broad spaces of his canvas, but he feels pleasure in these mainly because he is not native to their influences. The mountains are not his sponsors; there are not the unconsciousnesses between him and them which indicate kinship, nor the silences which prove entire communion. Moreover, the life of American men and women is almost absolutely unrepresented in the poetry of Bryant. The idealized red man is made use of as picturesque, an interesting and romantic person; but the Yankee is prosaic as his ledger. The American people had evidently not become an object of imaginative interest to itself in the mind of Bryant.</p><p>That the historical school of criticism should not have occupied itself with American literature is then hardly to be wondered at. A chapter upon that literature until recently must have been not a criticism but a prophecy. It was this very fact, the absence of a national literature, which the historical school was called on to explain. And to explain it evident and sufficient causes were producible, and were produced. The strictly Puritan origin of the Americans, the effort imposed upon them of subduing the physical forces of the country, and of yoking them to the service of man, the occupation of the entire community with an absorbing industry, the proximity of Europe, which made it possible for America to neglect the pursuit of the sciences, literature, and the fine arts without relapsing into barbarism\u2014these causes were enumerated by De Tocqueville as having concurred to fix the minds of the Americans upon purely practical objects. 'I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World; whilst the rest of the nation enjoying more leisure, and less harassed by the drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought, and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind.' Besides which, before a nation can become poetical to itself, consciously or unconsciously, it must possess a distinctive character, and the growth of national as of individual character is a process of long duration in every case, of longer duration than ordinary when a larger than ordinary variety of the elements of character wait to be assimilated and brought into harmony.</p><p>In Emerson a genuine product of the soil was perhaps for the first time apparent to us. We tasted in him the flavour of strange sap, and knew the ripening of another sun and other winds. He spoke of what is old and universal, but he spoke in the fashion of a modern man, and of his own nation. His Greek head pivoted restlessly on true Yankee shoulders, and when he talked Plato he did so in a dialectical variety of Attic peculiar to Boston. Lowell, at times altogether feudal and European, has also at times a trans-Atlantic air, in the earnest but somewhat vague spiritualism of his earlier poems, his enthusiasm about certain dear and dim general ideas, and more happily in a conception of the democratic type of manhood which appears in some of the poems of later years, especially in that very noble 'Ode recited at the Harvard Commemoration, July 21, 1865.' But taken as a whole, the works of Lowell do not mirror the life, the thoughts, and passions of the nation. They are works, as it were, of an English poet who has become a naturalized citizen of the United States, who admires the institutions, and has faith in the ideas of America, but who cannot throw off his allegiance to the old country, and its authorities.</p><p>At last steps forward a man unlike any of his predecessors, and announces himself, and is announced with a flourish of critical trumpets, as Bard of America, and Bard of democracy. What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-world clay, not cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timidly from behind his works to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am a solid and not an inconsiderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications. He attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love; or, our extreme repugnance. He does anything except leave us indifferent. However we feel towards him we cannot despise him. He is 'a summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be got rid of. Passed by he cannot be. To English readers Whitman is already known through Mr. Conway's personal reminiscences, published in the 'Fortnightly Review', through the judicious criticism of Mr. Rossetti prefixed to his volume of selections, and through other reviews, favourable and unfavourable. His critics have, for the most part, confined their attention to the personality of the man; they have studied him, for the most part, as a phenomenon isolated from the surrounding society, the environment, the milieu, which has made such a phenomenon possible. In a general way it has been said that Whitman is the representative in art of American democracy, but the meaning of this has not been investigated in detail. It is purposed here to consider some of the characteristics of democratic art, and to inquire in what manner they manifest themselves in Whitman's work.</p><p>A word of explanation is necessary. The representative man of a nation is not always the nation's favourite. Hebrew spiritualism, the deepest instincts, the highest reaches of the moral attainment of the Jewish race, appear in the cryings and communings of its prophets; yet the prophets sometimes cried in the wilderness, and the people went after strange gods. American democracy is as yet but half-formed. The framework of its institutions exists, but the will, the conscience, the mature desires of the democratic society are still in process of formation. If Whitman's writings are spoken of as the poetry of American democracy, it is not implied that his are the volumes most inquired after in the libraries of New York or Boston. What one means is that these are the poems which naturally arise when a man of imaginative genius stands face to face with a great democratic world, as yet but half-fashioned, such as society is in the United States of the present day. Successive editions of his works prove that Whitman has many readers. But whether he had them now, or waited for them in years to come, it would remain true that he is the first representative democrat in art of the American Continent. At the same time he is before all else a living man, and must not be compelled to appear as mere official representative of anything. He will not be comprehended in a formula. No view of him can image the substance, the life and movement of his manhood, which contracts and dilates, and is all over sensitive and vital. Such views are, however, valuable in the study of literature, as hypotheses are in the natural sciences, at least for the collocation of facts. They have a tendency to render criticism rigid and doctrinaire; the critic must therefore ever be ready to escape from his own theory of a man, and come in contact with the man himself. Every one doubtless moves in some regular orbit, and all aberrations are only apparent, but what the precise orbit is we must be slow to pronounce. Meanwhile we may legitimately conjecture, as Kepler conjectured, if only we remain ready as Kepler was to vary our conjectures as the exigencies of the observed phenomena require.</p><p>A glance at the art of an aristocratic period will inform us in the way of contrast of much that we may expect to find under a democracy. And before all else we are impressed by the great regard which the artists of an aristocratic period pay to form. The dignity of letters maintains itself, like the dignity of the court, by a regulated propriety of manners. Ideas and feelings cannot be received unless they wear the courtly costume. Precise canons applicable to the drama, the ode, the epic, to painting, sculpture, architecture, music, are agreed upon, and are strictly enforced. They acquire traditional authority, the precedents of a great period of art (such, for example, as that of Louis XIV.) being final and absolute with succeeding generations. 'Style is deemed of almost as much importance as thought\u2026.The tone of mind is always dignified, seldom very animated, and writers care more to perfect what they produce than to multiply their productions.' The peril to which an aristocratic literature is hereby exposed is of a singular kind; matter or substance may cease to exist, while an empty and elaborately studied form, a variegated surface with nothing below it, may remain. This condition of things was actually realized at different times in the literatures of Italy, of Spain, of France, and of England, when such a variegated surface of literature served for disport and display of the wits of courtiers, of ingenious authors, of noble and gentle persons male and female, and when reflection and imagination had ceased to have any relation with letters.</p><p>Again, the literature of an aristocracy is distinguished by its striving after selectness, by its exclusive spirit, and the number of things it proscribes. This is especially the case with the courtly art which has a great monarchy for its centre of inspiration. There is an ever-present terror of vulgarity. Certain words are ineligible in poetry; they are mean or undignified, and the things denoted by them must be described in an elegant periphrasis. Directness and vividness are sacrificed to propriety. The acquired associations of words are felt to be as important, and claim as much attention as their immediate significance, their spiritual power and personal character. In language as in life there is, so to speak, an aristocracy and a commonalty; words with a heritage of dignity, words which have been ennobled, and a rabble of words which are excluded from positions of honour and of trust. But this striving after selectness in forms of speech is the least important manifestation of the exclusive spirit of aristocratic art. Far the greater number of men and women, classes of society, conditions of life, modes of thought and feeling, are not even conceived as in any way susceptible of representation in art which aspires to be grave and beautiful. The common people do not show themselves en masse except as they may follow in a patient herd, or oppose in impotent and insolent revolt the leadership of their lords. Individually they are never objects of equal interest with persons of elevated worldly station. Even Shakespeare could hardly find in humble life other virtues than a humorous honesty and an affectionate fidelity. Robin Hood, the popular hero, could not be quite heroic were he not of noble extraction, and reputed Earl of Huntingdon. In the decline of an aristocratic period, dramatic studies of individual character and the life of the peasant or artisan may be made from a superior point of view. The literature of benevolence and piety stooping down to view the sad bodies and souls of men tends in this direction. And there are poems and novels, and paintings and sculptures, which flatter the feeling of mild benevolence. Pictures like those of Faed, in which some aged cottager, some strong delver of the earth, or searcher of the sea, some hardworked father of children, says appealingly, 'By virtue of this love I exhibit towards my offspring, by virtue of the correct sense I have of the condescension of my betters, by virtue of this bit of pathos\u2014indubitably human\u2014in my eye, confess now am I not a man and a brother?'\u2014pictures like these are produced, and may be purchased by amiable persons of the upper classes who would honour the admirable qualities which exist in humble life. But when the aristocratic period is in its strength, and especially in courtly art and literature, these condescending studies, not without a certain affection and sincerity in them, are unknown. It is as if the world were made up of none but the gently born and bred. At most rustic life is glanced at for the sake of the suggestions of pretty waywardness it may supply to the fancy of great people tired of greatness. To play at pastoral may be for a while the fashion, if the shepherds and shepherdesses are permitted to choose graceful classical names, if the crooks are dainty, and the duties of the penfold not severe, if Phillis may set off a neat ankle with the latest shoe, and Corydon may complain of the cruel fair in the bitterness of roundel or sonnet. The middle classes, however, the bourgeoisie, figure considerably in one department of poetry\u2014in the comic drama. Moliere indeed, living under a stricter rule of courtliness, suffered disgrace in consequence of the introduction of so low-bred a person as the excellent M. Jourdain. But to the noble mind of our own Caroline period how rich a material of humour, inexhaustibly diverting, if somewhat monotonous in theme, was afforded by the relations of the high-born and the moneyed classes. The bourgeois aping the courtier, the lord making a fool of the merchant, while he makes love to the merchant's wife and daughter\u2014what unextinguishable laughter have variations upon these elementary themes compelled from the occupants of the boxes in our Restoration theatres! There is an innocence quite touching in their openness to impressions from the same comic effects repeated again and again. Harlequin still at the close of the pantomime belabouring Pantaloon is not more sure of his success with the wide-eyed on-lookers in the front row than was the gallant engaged in seducing the draper's or hosier's pretty wife with gold supplied by her husband, in the playhouses favoured by our mirthful monarch and his companions.</p><p>All that is noblest in an aristocratic age embodies itself not in its comedy, but its serious art, and in the persons of heroic men and women. Very high and admirable types of character are realized in the creation of epic and dramatic poetry. All the virtues which a position of hereditary greatness, dignity, and peril calls forth\u2014energy of character, vigour of will, disregard of life, of limb, and of property in comparison with honour, the virtues of generosity, loyalty, courtesy, magnificence\u2014these are glorified and illustrated in man; and in woman all the virtues of dependence, all the graces insensibly acquired upon the surface of an externally beautiful world, and at times the rarer qualities called forth by occasional exigencies of her position, which demand virtues of the masculine kind. It is characteristic and right that our chief chivalric epic, the Faerie Queene, should set before itself as the general end of all the book 'to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline.' The feudal world with Artegall and Calidore, with Britomart and Una, was not wanting in lofty conceptions of human character, male and female.</p><p>Other characteristics of the art of an aristocratic period may be briefly noted. It is not deeply interested in the future, it gazes forward with no eyes of desire. Why should it? when nothing seems better than that things should remain as they are, or at most that things should be ameliorated, not that a new world should be created. The aristocratic society exists by inheritance, and it hopes from to-morrow chiefly a conserving of the good gifts handed down by yesterday and to-day. Its feeling of the continuity of history is in danger of becoming formal and materialistic; it does not always perceive that the abandonment of old things and the acceptance of new may be a necessary piece of continuity in government, in social life, in art, in religion. At the present the artist of the period of aristocracy looks not very often, and then askance upon certain approved parts of the Present. But he loves to celebrate the glories of the Past. He displays a preference accordingly for antique subjects, chosen out of the history of his own land, or the histories of deceased nations. Shelley with his eyes fixed upon the golden age to come may stand as representative of the democratic tendencies in art; Scott, celebrat-ing the glories of feudalism, its heroism and its refinements, will remain our great aristocratic artist of the period subsequent to the first French Revolution. The relation of the art to the religion of an age of aristocracy is peculiarly simple. The religious dogma which constitutes the foundation and formative principle of the existing society must have been fully established, and of supreme power, before the aristocratic form of social and political life can have acquired vigour and stability; the intellectual and moral habits favoured by the aristocratic polity\u2014loyalty, obedience, veneration for authority, pride in the past, a willingness to accept things as they come to us from our fathers, a distrust of new things, all favour a permanence of belief. The art, therefore, will upon the whole (peculiar circumstances may of course produce remarkable exceptions) be little disturbed by the critical or sceptical spirit, and, untroubled by doubts, that art will either concern itself not at all with religion, or, accepting the religious dogma without dispute, will render it into artistic form in sublime allegory and symbol, and as it is found embodied in the venerable history of the Church. We may finally note from De Tocqueville the shrinking in an aristocratic society from whatever, even in pleasure, is too startling, violent, or acute, and the especial approval of choice gratifications, of refined and delicate enjoyments.</p><p>Now in all these particulars the art of a democratic age exhibits characteristics precisely opposite to those of the art of an aristocracy. Form and style modelled on traditional examples are little valued. No canons of composition are agreed upon or observed without formal agreement. No critical dictator enacts laws which are accepted without dispute, and acquire additional authority during many years. Each new generation, with its new heave of life, its multitudinous energies, ideas, passions, is a law to itself. Except public opinion, there is no authority on earth above the authority of a man's own soul, and public opinion being strongly in favour of individualism, a writer is tempted to depreciate unduly the worth of order, propriety, regularity of the academic kind; he is encouraged to make new literary experiments as others make new experiments in religion; he is permitted to be true to his own instincts, whether they are beautiful instincts or the reverse. The appeal which a work of art makes is to the nation, not to a class, and diversities of style are consequently admissible. Every style can be tolerated except the vapid, everything can be accepted but that which fails to stimulate the intellect or the passions.</p><p>Turning to Whitman, we perceive at once that his work corresponds with this state of things. If he had written in England in the period of Queen Anne, if he had written in France in the period of the grand monarque, he must have either acknowledged the supremacy of authority in literature and submitted to it, or on the other hand revolted against it. As it is, he is remote from authority, and neither submits nor revolts. Whether we call what he has written verse or prose, we have no hesitation in saying that it is no copy, that it is something uncontrolled by any model or canon, something which takes whatever shape it possesses directly from the soul of its maker. With the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare familiar to him, Whitman writes in the presence of great models, and some influences from each have doubtless entered into his nature; but that they should possess authority over him any more than that he should possess authority over them, does not occur to him as possible. The relation of democracy to the Past comes out very notably here. Entirely assured of its own right to the Present, it is prepared to acknowledge fully the right of past generations to the Past. It is not hostile to that Past, rather claims kinship with it, but also claims equality, as a full-grown son with a father:\u2014</p><p>'I conn'd old times;<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters <br>might return and study me!<br>In the name of These States, shall I scorn the <br>antique?<br>Why These are the children of the antique, to <br>justify it.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophs, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long <br>since,<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, with- drawn or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit <br>what you have left, wafted hither:<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable (moving <br>awhile among it);<br>Think nothing can ever be greater,\u2014nothing <br>can ever deserve more than it deserves;<br>Regarding it all intently a long while,\u2014then <br>dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.'</p><p>It is the same thought which finds expression in the following enumeration of the benefactors of the soul of man in Whitman's prose essay Democratic Vistas; after which enumeration, they are dismissed, and a summons is sent forth for the appearance of their modern successors:\u2014</p><p>'For us along the great highways of time, those monuments stand\u2014those forms of majesty and beauty. For us those beacons burn through all the nights. Unknown Egyptians, graving hieroglyphs; Hindus with hymn and apothegm and endless epic; Hebrew prophet, with spirituality, as in flashes of lightning, conscience, like red-hot iron, plaintive songs and screams of vengeance for tyrannies and enslavement; Christ, with bent head, brooding love and peace, like a dove; Greek, creating eternal shapes of physical and esthetic proportion; Roman, lord of satire, the sword, and the codex;\u2014of the figures some far-off and veiled, others nearer and visible; Dante, stalking with lean form, nothing but fibre, not a grain of superfluous flesh; Angelo, and the great painters, architects, musicians; rich Shakespeare, luxuriant as the sun, artist and singer of Feudalism in its sunset, with all the gorgeous colours, owner thereof, and using them at will; and so to such as German Kant and Hegel, where they, though near us, leaping over the ages, sit again impassive, imperturbable, like the Egyptian gods. Of these, and the like of these, is it too much, indeed, to return to our favourite figure, and view them as orbs and systems of orbs, moving in free paths in the spaces of that other heaven, the kosmic intellect, the Soul?</p><p>'Ye powerful and resplendent ones! ye were in your atmospheres, grown not for America, but rather for her foes, the Feudal and the old\u2014while our genius is Democratic and modern. Yet could ye, indeed, but breathe your breath of life into our New World's nostrils\u2014not to enslave us, as now, but for our needs, to breed a spirit like your own\u2014perhaps (dare we to say it?) to dominate, even destroy, what you yourselves have left! On your plane, and no less, but even higher and wider, will I mete and measure for our wants to-day and here. I demand races of orbic bards, with unconditional, uncompromising sway. Come forth, sweet democratic despots of the west!'</p><p>As in all else, so with regard to the form of what he writes, Walt Whitman can find no authority superior to himself, or rather to the rights of the subject which engages him. There is, as Mr. Rossetti has observed, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense,' throughout his writings, prose and verse (if we consent to apply the term verse to any of them), and this rhythmical sense, as with every great poet, is original and inborn. His works, it may be, exhibit no perfect crystal of artistic form, but each is a menstruum saturated with form in solution. He fears to lose the instinctive in any process of elaboration, the vital in anything which looks like mechanism. He does not write with a full consciousness of the processes of creation, nor does any true poet. Certain combinations of sound are preconceived, and his imagination excited by them works towards them by a kind of reflex action, automatically. His ars poetica is embodied in the precept that the poet should hold himself passive in presence of the material universe, in presence of society, in presence of his own soul, and become the blind but yet unerringly guided force through which these seek artistic expression. No afterthought, no intrusion of reasoning, no calculating of effects, no stepping back to view his work is tolerated. The artist must create his art with as little hesitation, as little questioning of processes, and as much sureness of result as the beaver builds his house. Very nobly Whitman has spoken on this subject, and let those who, because they do not know him, suppose him insensible to any attractions in art except those of the extravagant, the incoherent, and the lawless, read what follows from the preface to 'Leaves of Grass':\u2014</p><p><em>'The art of art, the glory of expression, and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity\u2014nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse, and pierce intellectual depths, and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods, and grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have looked on him who has achieved it, you have looked on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey-gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art\u2026. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt, or startle, or fascinate, or soothe, I will have purposes as health, or heat, or snow has, and be as regardless of observation.'</em></p><p>Seeing much of deep truth in this, it must be added that, when the poet broods over his half-formed creation, and fashions it with divine ingenuity, and gives it shapeliness and completion of detail, and the lustre of finished workmanship, he does not forsake his instincts, but is obedient to them; he does not remove from nature into a laboratory of art, but is the close companion of nature. The vital spontaneous movement of the faculties, far from ceasing, still goes on like 'the flight of the grey-gull over the bay,' while the poet seeks after order, proportion, comeliness, melody\u2014in a word beauty; or rather, as Whitman himself is fond of saying, does not seek but is sought\u2014the perfect form preconceived but unattained, drawing the artist toward itself with an invincible attraction. An artist who does not yield to the desire for perfect order and beauty of form, instead of coming closer to nature is really forsaking nature, and doing violence to a genuine artistic instinct. Walt Whitman, however, knows this in all probability well enough, and does not need to be taught the mysteries of his craft. We will not say that his poems, as regards their form, do not, after all, come right, or that for the matter which he handles his manner of treatment may not be the best possible. One feels, as it has been well said, that although no counting of syllables will reveal the mechanism of the music, the music is there, and that 'one would not for something change ears with those who cannot hear it.' Whitman himself anticipates a new theory of literary composition for imaginative works, and especially for highest poetry, and desires the recognition of new forces in language, and the creation of a new manner of speech which cares less for what it actually realizes in definite form than 'for impetus and effects, and for what it plants and invigorates to grow.' Nevertheless, when we read not the lyrical portions of Whitman's poetry, but what may be called his poetical statements of thoughts and things, a suspicion arises that if the form be suitable here to the matter, it must be because the matter belongs rather to the chaos than the kosmos of the new-created world of art.</p><p>The principle of equality upon which the democratic form of society is founded, obviously opposes itself to the exclusive spirit of the aristocratical polity. The essential thing which gives one the freedom of the world is not to be born a man of this or that rank, or class, or caste, but simply to be born a man. The literature of an aristocratic period is distinguished by its aim at selectness, and the number of things it proscribes; we should expect the literature of a democracy to be remarkable for its comprehensiveness, its acceptance of the persons of all men, its multiform sympathies. The difference between the President and the Broadway mason or hodman is inconsiderable\u2014an accident of office; what is common to both is the inexpressibly important thing, their inalienable humanity. Rich and poor, high and low, powerful and feeble, healthy and diseased, deformed and beautiful, old and young, man and woman, have this in common, and by possession of this are in the one essential thing equal, and brethren one of another. Even between the virtuous man and the vicious the difference is less than the agreement; they differ by a quality, but agree by the substance of their manhood. The man in all men, however it may be obscured by cruel shocks and wrenches of life which distort, by long unnatural uses which deform, by ignorance, by the well-meaning stupidity of others, or by one's own stupidity, by foul living, or by clean, hard, worldly living, is surely somewhere discoverable. How can any human creature be rejected, any scorned, any mocked? Such satire and such comedy as appear in aristocratic society are discouraged by the genius of democracy. The spirit of exclusiveness will, it is true, never fail to find material for its support, and baser prizes may replace the calm, conservative, but unaggressive pride of hereditary dignity. Nevertheless it remains no less true that the spectacle of a great democracy present to the imagination, and the temper of the democracy accepted by the understanding heart, favour only such prides as are founded on nature\u2014that is, on the possession, acquired or inherited, of personal qualities, personal powers, and virtues, and attainments.</p><p>If this be a true account of some characteristics of the art which rises when a man of imaginative genius stands face to face with a great democracy, Walt Whitman in these particulars is what he claims to be, a representative democrat in art. No human being is rejected by him, no one slighted, nor would he judge any, except as 'the light falling around a helpless thing' judges. No one in his poems comes appealing 'Am I not interesting, am I not deserving, am I not a man and a brother?' We have had, he thinks, 'ducking and deprecating about enough.' The poet studies no one from a superior point of view. He delights in men, and neither approaches deferentially those who are above him, nor condescendingly gazes upon those who are beneath. He is the comrade of every man, high and low. His admiration of a strong, healthy, and beautiful body, or a strong, healthy, and beautiful soul, is great when he sees it in a statesman or a savant; it is precisely as great when he sees it in the ploughman or the smith. Every variety of race and nation, every condition in society, every degree of culture, every season of human life, is accepted by Whitman as admirable and best, each in its own place. Working men of every name\u2014all who engage in fieldwork, all who toil upon the sea, the city artisan, the woodsman and the trapper, fill him with pleasure by their presence; and that they are interesting to him not in a general way of theory or doctrine (a piece of the abstract democratic creed), but in the way of close, vital human sympathy appears from the power he possesses of bringing before us with strange precision, vividness, and nearness in a few decisive strokes the essential characteristics of their respective modes of living. If the strong, full-grown working man wants a lover and comrade, he will think Walt Whitman especially made for him. If the young man wants one, he will think him especially the poet of young men. Yet a rarer and finer spell than that of the lusty vitality of youth, or the trained activity of manhood, is exercised over the poet by the beautiful repose or unsubdued energy of old age. He is 'the caresser of life, wherever moving.' He does not search antiquity for heroic men and beautiful women; his own abundant vitality makes all the life which surrounds him a source of completest joy; 'what is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me\u2026.not asking the sky to come down to my good-will; scattering it freely for ever.' Let a few passages illustrate Whitman's joyous sympathy with men:\u2014</p><p>'I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like <br>is enough,<br>To stop in company with the rest at evening <br>is enough,<br>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breath-<br>ing, laughing flesh is enough,<br>To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest <br>my arm ever so lightly round his or her <br>neck for a moment\u2014what is this, then?<br>I do not ask any more delight. I swim in it, <br>as in a sea.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>'The big doors of the country barn stand open <br>and ready;<br>The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the <br>slow-drawn wagon;<br>The clear light plays on the brown grey and <br>green intertinged;<br>The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.<br>I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the <br>load;<br>I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the<br> other;<br>I jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clo-<br>ver and timothy,<br>And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair<br> full of wisps.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>'The negro holds firmly the reins of his four <br>horses, the block swags underneath on its <br>tied-over chain;<br>The negro that drives the dray of the stone- <br>yard, steady and tall he stands, pois'd on <br>one leg on the string-piece;<br>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and <br>breast, and loosens over his hip-band;<br>His glance is tall and commanding, he tosses <br>the slouch of his hat away from his fore- <br>head;<br>The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache, <br>falls on the black of his polished and per-<br>fect limbs.<br>I behold the picturesque giant, and love him.'</p><p>The following loses much by being removed from its place at the end of the poem of 'Faces,' which it closes with calm melodious chords:\u2014</p><p>'The old face of the mother of many children!<br>Whist! I am fully content.<br>Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day <br>morning,<br>It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fen-<br>ces,<br>It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry,<br> and the cat-brier under them.<br>I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,<br>I heard what the singers were singing so long,<br>Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the <br>white froth and the water-blue.<br>Behold a woman!<br>She looks out from her quaker-cap\u2014her face is <br>clearer and more beautiful than the sky.<br>She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded <br>porch of the farmhouse,<br>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen;<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-<br>daughters spun it with the distaff and the <br>wheel.<br>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, <br>and does not wish to go,<br>The justified mother of men.'</p><p>But it is not those alone who are beautiful and healthy and good who claim the poet's love. To all 'the others are down on' Whitman's hand is outstretched to help, and through him come to us the voices\u2014petitions or demands\u2014of the diseased and despairing, of slaves, of prostitutes, of thieves, of deformed persons, of drunkards. Every man is a divine miracle to him, and he sees a redeemer, whom Christ will not be ashamed to acknowledge a comrade, in every one who performs an act of loving self-sacrifice:\u2014</p><p>'Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row, <br>from three lusty angels with shirts bagged <br>out at their waists;<br>The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeem-<br>ing sins past and to come,<br>Selling all he possesses, travelling on foot to <br>fee lawyers for his brother, and sit by him <br>while he is tried for forgery.'</p><p>Is there no limit to the poet's acceptance of the persons of men? There is one test of his tolerance more severe than can be offered by the vicious or the deformed. Can he tolerate the man of science? Yes, though he were to find him peeping and botanizing upon his mother's grave. Science and democracy appear before Whitman as twin powers which bend over the modern world hand in hand, great and beneficent. Democracy seems to him that form of society which alone is scientifically justifiable; founded upon a recognition of the facts of nature, and a resolute denial of social fables, superstitions, and uninvestigated tradition. Moreover he looks to science for important elements which shall contribute to a new conception of nature and of man, and of their mutual relations, to be itself the ideal basis of a new poetry and art\u2014'after the chemist, geologist, ethnologist, finally shall come the Poet worthy that name; the true Son of God shall come singing his songs.' Lastly, Whitman has a peculiar reason of his own for loving science; he is a mystic, and such a mystic as finds positive science not unacceptable. Whitman's mysticism is not of the Swedenborgian type. He beholds no visions of visible things in heaven or hell unseen to other men. He rather sees with extraordinary precision the realities of our earth, but he sees them, in his mystical mood, as symbols of the impalpable and spiritual. They are hieroglyphs most clear-cut, most brilliantly and definitely coloured to his eyes, but still expressive of something unseen. His own personality as far as he can give it expression or is conscious of it\u2014that identity of himself, which is the hardest of all facts, and the only entrance to all facts, is yet no more than the image projected by another ego, the real Me, which stands 'untouched, untold, altogether unreached:'\u2014</p><p>'Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-con- <br>gratulatory signs and bows,<br>With peals of ironical laughter at every word <br>I have written,</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>Now I perceive I have not understood anything <br>\u2014not a single object; and that no man ever <br>can.<br>I perceive Nature, here in sight of the sea, is <br>taking advantage of me, to dart upon me, and <br>sting me,<br>Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing <br>at all.'</p><p>To such mysticism science cannot succeed in opposing itself: it can but provide the mystic with a new leaf of the sacred writing in which spiritual truths are recorded. Note the pregnant parenthesis in the following:</p><p>'Gentlemen! [men of science] to you the first <br>honours always.<br>Your facts are useful and real, and yet they are <br>not my dwelling;<br>(I but enter by them into an area of my dwell-<br>ing.)'</p><p>If Whitman seems suspicious of any class of men, disposed to be antagonistic to any, it is to those whose lives are spent among books, who are not in contact with external nature, and the stir and movement of human activity, but who receive things already prepared, or, as Whitman expresses it, 'distilled.' He knows that the distillations are delightful, and would intoxicate himself also, but he will not let them. Rather he chooses to 'lean and loafe at his ease, observing a spear of summer grass,' to drink the open air (that is, everything natural and unelaborated); he is 'enamoured of growing outdoors.' At the same time his most ardent aspiration is after a new literature, accordant with scientific conceptions, and the feelings which correspond with democracy. And to the literature of the old world and of feudalism he willingly does justice. 'American students may well derive from all former lands\u2026. from witty and warlike France, and markedly, and in many ways, and at many different periods, from the enterprise and soul of the great Spanish race, bearing ourselves always courteous, always deferential, indebted beyond measure to the mother- world, to all its nations dead, as to all its nations living\u2014the offspring, this America of ours, the daughter not by any means of the British Isles exclusively, but of the Continent, and of all continents.' True culture and learning Whitman venerates; but he suspects men of refinement and polite letters and dainty information, the will-o'-the-wisps of Goethe's 'M\u00e4hrchen,' who 'lose themselves in countless masses of adjustments,' who end by becoming little better than 'supercilious infidels,' whose culture, as Carlyle long since observed, is of a 'sceptical-destructive' kind.</p><p>Men of every class then are interesting to Whitman. But no individual is pre-eminently interesting to him. His sketches of individual men and women, though wonderfully vivid and precise, are none of them longer than a page; each single figure passes rapidly out of sight, and a stream of other figures of men and women succeeds. Even in 'Lincoln's Burial Hymn' he has only a word to say of 'the large sweet soul that has gone;' the chords of his nocturn, with their implicated threefold sweetness, odour and sound and light, having passed into his strain, really speak not of Lincoln but of death. George Peabody is celebrated briefly, because through him, a 'stintless, lavish giver, tallying the gifts of earth,' a multitude of human beings have been blessed, and the true service of riches illustrated. No single person is the subject of Whitman's song, or can be; the individual suggests a group, and the group a multitude, each unit of which is as interesting as every other unit, and possesses equal claims to recognition. Hence the recurring tendency of his poems to become catalogues of persons and things. Selection seems forbidden to him; if he names one race of mankind the names of all other races press into his page; if he mentions one trade or occupation, all other trades and occupations follow. A long procession of living forms passes before him; each several form, keenly inspected for a moment, is then dismissed. Men and women are seen en masse, and the mass is viewed not from a distance, but close at hand, where it is felt to be a concourse of individuals. Whitman will not have the people appear in his poems by representatives or delegates; the people itself, in its undiminished totality, marches through his poems, making its greatness and variety felt. Writing down the headings of a Trades' Directory is not poetry; but this is what Whitman never does. His catalogues are for the poet always, if not always for the reader, visions\u2014they are delighted\u2014not perhaps delightful\u2014enumerations; when his desire for the perception of greatness and variety is satisfied, not when a really complete catalogue is made out, Whitman's enumeration ends; we may murmur, but Whitman has been happy; what has failed to interest our imaginations has deeply interested his; and even for us the impression of multitude, of variety, of equality is produced, as perhaps it could be in no other way. Whether Whitman's habit of cataloguing be justified by what has been said, or is in any way justifiable, such at least is its true interpretation and significance.</p><p>One can perceive at a glance that these characteristics of Whitman's work proceed directly from the democratic tendencies of the world of thought and feeling in which he moves. It is curious to find De Tocqueville, before there existed properly any native American literature, describing in the spirit of philosophical prophecy what we find realized in Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass':\u2014</p><p>'He who inhabits a democratic country sees around him, on every hand, men differing but little from each other; he cannot turn his mind to any one portion of mankind without expanding and dilating his thought till it embraces the whole world\u2026. The poets of democratic ages can never take any man in particular as the subject of a piece, for an object of slender importance, which is distinctly seen on all sides, will never lend itself to an ideal conception\u2026. As all the citizens who compose a democratic community are nearly equal and alike, the poet cannot dwell upon any one of them; but the nation itself invites the exercise of his powers. The general similitude of individuals which renders any one of them, taken separately, an improper subject of poetry, allows poets to include them all in the same imagery, and to take a general survey of the people itself. Democratic nations have a clearer perception than any other of their own aspect; and an aspect so imposing is admirably fitted to the delineation of the ideal.'</p><p>The democratic poet celebrates no individual hero, nor does he celebrate himself. 'I celebrate myself,' sings Whitman, and the longest poem in 'Leaves of Grass' is named by his own name; but the self-celebration throughout is celebration of himself as a man and an American; it is what he possesses in common with all others that he feels to be glorious and worthy of song, not that which differentiates him from others; manhood, and in particular American manhood, is the real subject of the poem 'Walt Whitman;' and although Whitman has a most poignant feeling of personality, which indeed is a note of all he has written, it is to be remembered that in nearly every instance in which he speaks of himself the reference is as much impersonal as personal. In what is common he finds what is most precious. The true hero of the democratic poet is the nation of which he is a member, or the whole race of man to which the nation belongs. The mettlesome, proud, turbulent, brave, self-asserting young Achilles, lover of women and lover of comrades of Whitman's epic, can be no other than the American people; his Ulysses, the prudent, the 'cute, the battler with the forces of nature, the traveller in sea-like prairie, desolate swamp, and dense forest is brother Jonathan. But if the American nation is his hero, let it be observed that it is the American nation as the supposed leader of the human race, as the supposed possessor in ideas, in type of character, and in tendency if not in actual achievement, of all that is most powerful and promising for the progress of mankind.</p><p>To the future Whitman looks to justify his confidence in America and in democracy. The aspect of the present he finds both sad and encouraging. The framework of society exists; the material civilization is rich and fairly organized. Without any transcendentalism or political mysticism about the principle of universal suffrage, not glossing over its 'appalling dangers,' and for his own part content that until its time were come self-government should wait, and the condition of authoritative tutelage continue, he yet approves the principle as 'the only safe and preservative one for coming times,' and sees in America its guardian. He dwells with inexhaustible delight upon certain elements in the yet unformed personal character of the average American man and woman. And his experience, and the experience of the nation during the civil war\u2014proving the faithfulness, obedience, docility, courage, fortitude, religious nature, tenderness, sweet affection of countless numbers of the unnamed, unknown rank and file of North and South\u2014practically justifies democracy in Whitman's eyes 'beyond the proudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts.' But at the same time no one perceives more clearly, or observes with greater anxiety and alarm, the sore diseases of American society; and leaving us to reconcile his apparently contradictory statements, he does not hesitate to declare that the New World democracy, 'however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain highly de-ceptive superficial popular intellectuality, is so far an almost complete failure in its social aspects, in any superb general personal character, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, and \u2018sthetic results.' A vast and more and more thoroughly appointed body Whitman finds in the American world, and little or no soul. His senses are flattered, his imagination roused and delighted by the vast movement of life which surrounds him, its outward glory and gladness, but when he inquires, What is behind all this? the answer is of the saddest and most shameful kind. The following passage is in every way, in substance and in manner, highly characteristic of Whitman; but the reader must remember that in spite of all that he discerns of evil in democratic America, Whitman remains an American proud of his nationality, and a believer who does not waver in his democratic faith:\u2014</p><p>'After an absence, I am now (September, 1870) again in New York City and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bay, sparkling sea-tides, costly and lofty new buildings, the facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich shops, the wharves, the great Central Park, and the Brooklyn Park of Hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)\u2014the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trade, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters\u2014these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my senses of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my \u2018sthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the East and North rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilothouses, or pass an hour in Wall Street, or the gold exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom, and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas\u2014but in the artificial, the work of man too is equally great\u2014in this profusion of teeming humanity, in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships\u2014these seething, hurrying, feverish crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p><p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general effect; coming down to what is of the only real importance, Personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask, Are there, indeed, Men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women, to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Are there arts worthy Freedom, and a rich people? Is there a great moral and religious civilization\u2014the only justification of a great material one?</p><p>Confess that rather to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infidelity\u2014everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe\u2014everywhere an abnormal libidinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignoned, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (considering the advantages enjoyed) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p><p>Such a picture of the outcome of American democracy is ugly enough to satisfy the author of 'Shooting Niagara\u2014and after?' but such a picture only represents the worst side of the life of great cities. Whitman can behold these things, not without grief, not without shame, but without despair. He does not unfairly contrast the early years of confusion and crudity of a vast industrial and democratic era with the last and perfected results of an era of feudalism and aristocracy. He finds much to make him sad; but more to make him hopeful. He takes account of the evil anxiously, accurately; and can still rejoice. Upon the whole his spirit is exulting and prompt in cheerful action; not self-involved, dissatisfied, and fed by indignation. Contrast with the passage given above Whitman's preface to 'Leaves of Grass' prefixed to Mr. Rossetti's volume of Selections, with its joyous confidence and pride in American persons and things, or that very noble poem 'A Carol of Harvest, for 1867,' in which the armies of blue-clad conquering men are seen streaming North, and melt away and disappear, while in the same hour the heroes reappear, toiling in the fields, harvesting the products, glad and secure under the beaming sun, and under the great face of Her, the Mother, the Republic, without whom not a scythe might swing in security, 'not a maize-stalk dangle its silken tassels in peace.' If all enthusiasm about political principles be of the nature of Schw\u00e4rmerei, Whitman's feeling towards the Republic deserves that name; but he would have the principles of democracy sternly tested by results,\u2014results not only present but prospective and logically inevitable, and he has faith in them not because they seem to him to favour freedom any more than because they seem to favour law and self-control, and security, and order. He, as much as Mr. Carlyle, admires 'disciplined men,' and believes that with every disciplined man 'the arena of Anti-Anarchy, of God-appointed Order in this world' is widened; but he does not regard military service as the type of highest discipline, nor the drill-sergeant as highest conceivable official person in the land.</p><p>The principle of political and social equality once clearly conceived and taken to heart as true, works outward through one's body of thought and feeling in various directions. If in the polity of the nation every citizen be entitled by virtue of the fact of his humanity to make himself heard, to manifest his will, and in his place to be respected, then in the polity of the individual man, made up of the faculties of soul and body, every natural instinct, every passion, every appetite, every organ, every power, may claim its share in the government of the man. If a human being is to be honoured as such, then every part of a human being is to be honoured. In asserting one's rights as a man, one asserts the rights of everything which goes to make up manhood. It is the democratic temper to accept realities unless it is compelled to reject them; to disregard artificial distinctions, and refer all things to natural standards, consequently to honour things because they are natural and exist. Thus we find our way to the centre of what has been called the 'materialism' of Whitman\u2014his vindication of the body as it might be more correctly termed. Materialist, in any proper sense of the word, he is not; on the contrary, as Mr. Rossetti has stated, 'he is a most strenuous asserter of the soul,' but 'with the soul, of the body, as its infallible associate and vehicle in the present frame of things.' And as every faculty of the soul seems admirable and sacred to him, so does every organ and function and natural act of the body. But Whitman is a poet; it is not his manner to preach doctrines in an abstract form, by means of a general statement; and the doctrine, which seems to him of vital importance, that a healthy, perfect body\u2014male or female\u2014is altogether worthy of honour, admiration, and desire, is accordingly preached with fulness and plainness of detail. The head of his offending with many who read, and who refuse to read him, lies of course here. That lurking piece of asceticism, not yet cast out of most of us, which hints that there is something peculiarly shameful in the desire of the sexes for one another, of the man for the woman, and of the woman for the man, will certainly find matter enough of offence in one short section of 'Leaves of Grass', that entitled 'Children of Adam.' And one admission must be made to Whitman's disadvantage. If there be any class of subjects which it is more truly natural, more truly human not to speak of than to speak of (such speech producing self-consciousness, whereas part of our nature, it may be maintained, is healthy only while it lives and moves in holy blindness and unconsciousness of self), if there be any sphere of silence, then Whitman has been guilty of invading that sphere of silence. But he has done this by conviction that it is best to do so, and in a spirit as remote from base curiosity as from insolent licence. He deliberately appropriates a portion of his writings to the subject of the feelings of sex, as he appropriates another, 'Calamus,' to that of the love of man for man, 'adhesiveness,' as contrasted with 'amativeness,' in the nomenclature of Whitman, comradeship apart from all feelings of sex. That article of the poet's creed, which declares that man is very good, that there is nothing about him which is naturally vile or dishonourable, prepares him for absolute familiarity, glad, unabashed familiarity with every part and every act of the body. The ascetic teaching of many Medi\u00e6val writers is unfavourable to morality by its essential character: Whitman's may become unfavourable by accident. 'As to thy body, thou art viler than muck. Thou wast gotten of so vile matter, and so great filth, that it is shame for to speak, and abomination for to think. Thou shalt be delivered to toads and adders for to eat.' 'If thou say that thou lovest thy father and thy mother because thou art of their blood and of flesh gotten, so are the worms that come from them day by day. If thou love brethren or sisters or other kindred, because they are of the same flesh of father and mother and of the same blood, by the same reason should thou love a piece of their flesh, if it be shorn away.' 'All other sins [but wedlock] are nothing but sins, but this is a sin, and besides denaturalizes thee, and dishonours thy body. It soileth thy soul, and maketh it guilty before God, and moreover defileth thy flesh.' These were the views of pious persons of the thirteenth century. Here the body and the soul are kept in remote severance, each one the enemy of the other. Such spirituality, condemned alike by the facts of science and by the healthy natural human instincts, is seen by Whitman to be, even in its modern modifications, profoundly immoral. The lethargy of the soul induces it willingly to take up under some form or another with a theory which directs it heavenwards on the swift wings of devotional aspiration, rather than heavenwards for joy, but also earthwards for laborious duty, to animate, to quicken, to glorify all that apart from it is dull and gross. Both directions of the soul are declared necessary to our complete life by Whitman\u2014the one in solitude, the other in society.</p><p>'Only in the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of individuality may the spirituality of religion positively come forth at all. Only here, and on such terms, the meditation, the de-vout ecstasy, the soaring flight. Only here, communion with the mysteries, the eternal problems, whence? whither? Alone, and identity, and the mood,\u2014and the soul emerges, and all statements, churches, sermons, melt away like vapours. Alone, and silent thought, and awe, and aspiration,\u2014and then the interior consciousness, like a hitherto unseen inscription, in magic ink, beams out its wondrous lines, to the sense. Bibles may convey, and priests expound, but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of one's isolated self, to enter the pure ether of veneration, reach the divine levels, and commune with the unutterable.'</p><p>Then the soul can return to the body, and to the world, and possess them, and infuse its own life into them:\u2014</p><p>'I sing the Body electric;<br>The armies of those I love engirth me, and I <br>engirth them;<br>They will not let me off till I go with them,<br> respond to them,<br>And discorrupt them, and charge them full <br>with the charge of the soul.'</p><p>Having acknowledged that Whitman at times forgets that the 'instinct of silence,' as it has been well said, 'is a beautiful, imperishable part of nature,' and consequently that Whitman in a few passages falls below humanity, falls even below the modesty of brutes, everything has been acknowledged, and it ought not to be forgotten that no one asserts more strenuously than does Whitman the beauty, not indeed of asceticism, but of holiness or healthiness, and the shameful ugliness of unclean thought, desire, and deed. If he does not assert holiness as a duty, it is because he asserts it so strongly as a joy and a desire, and because he loves to see all duties transfigured into the glowing forms of joys and of desires. The healthy repose and continence, and the healthy eagerness and gratification of appetite, are equally sources of satisfaction to him. If in some of his lyrical passages there seems entire self-abandonment to passion, it is because he believes there are, to borrow his own phrase, 'native moments,' in which the desires receive permission from the supreme authority, conscience, to satisfy themselves completely:</p><p>'From the master\u2014the pilot I yield the vessel to;<br>The general commanding me, commanding all <br>\u2014from him permission taking.'</p><p>Whitman's most naked physical descriptions and enumerations are those of a robust, vigorous, clean man, enamoured of living, unashamed of body as he is unashamed of soul, absolutely free from pruriency of imagination, absolutely inexperienced in the artificial excitements and enhancements of jaded lusts. 'I feel deeply persuaded,' writes one of Whitman's critics who has received the impression of his mind most completely and faithfully, 'that a perfectly fearless, candid, ennobling treatment of the life of the body (so inextricably intertwined with, so potent in its influence on the life of the soul), will prove of inestimable value to all earnest and aspiring natures, impatient of the folly of the long prevalent belief that it is because of the greatness of the spirit that it has learned to despise the body, and to ignore its influences; knowing well that it is, on the contrary, just because the spirit is not great enough, not healthy and vigorous enough, to transfuse itself into the life of the body, elevating that and making it holy with its own triumphant intensity; knowing too how the body avenges this by dragging the soul down to the level assigned itself. Whereas the spirit must lovingly embrace the body, as the roots of a tree embrace the ground, drawing thence rich nourishment, warmth, impulse. Or rather the body is itself the root of the soul\u2014that whereby it grows and feeds. The great tide of healthful life that carries all before it must surge through the whole man, not beat to and fro in one corner of his brain. 'O the life of my senses and flesh, transcending my senses and flesh.' For the sake of all that is highest, a truthful recognition of this life, and especially of that of it which underlies the fundamental ties of humanity\u2014the love of husband and wife, fatherhood, motherhood\u2014is needed.'</p><p>The body then is not given authority over the soul by Whitman. Precisely as in the life of the nation a great material civilization seems admirable to him and worthy of honour, yet of little value in comparison with or apart from a great spiritual civilization, a noble national character, so in the life of the individual all that is external, material, sensuous, is estimated by the worth of what it can give to the soul. No Hebrew ever maintained the rights of the spiritual more absolutely. But towards certain parts of our nature, although in the poet's creed their rights are dogmatically laid down, he is practically unjust. The tendencies of his own nature lead him in his preaching to sink unduly certain articles of his creed. The logical faculty, in particular, is almost an offence to Whitman. The processes of reasoning appear to him to have elaboration for their characteristic, and nothing elaborated or manufactured seems of equal reality with what is natural and has grown. Truth he feels to be, as Wordsworth has said, 'a motion or a shape instinct with vital functions;' and were Whitman to seek for formal proof of such truth, he, like Wordsworth, would lose all feeling of conviction, and yield up moral questions in despair. 'A slumbering woman and child convince as an university course can never convince:'</p><p>'Logic and sermons never convince,<br>The damp of the night drives deeper into my <br>soul.'</p><p>Whitman becomes lyrical in presence of the imagination attempting for itself an interpretation of the problems of the world; he becomes lyrical in presence of gratified senses and desires; but he remains indifferent in presence of the understanding searching after conclusions. There is something like intolerance or want of comprehensiveness here; one's heart, touched by the injustice, rises to take the part of this patient, serviceable, despised understanding.</p><p>Whitman, as we have seen, accepts the persons of all men, but for a certain make of manhood he manifests a marked preference. The reader can guess pretty correctly from what has gone before what manner of man best satisfies the desires of the poet, and makes him happiest by his presence; and what is the poet's ideal of human character. The man possessed of the largest mass of manhood, manhood of the most natural quality, unelaborated, undistilled, freely displaying itself, is he towards whom Whitman is instinctively attracted. The heroes honoured by the art of an aristocracy are ideal, not naturalistic. Their characters are laboriously formed after a noble model, tempered as steel is tempered, welded together and wrought into permanent shape as their armour is. The qualities which differentiate them from most men are insisted upon. They are as little a growth of nature (in the vulgar sense of the word nature) as is a statue. Corneille's stoical heroes, for example, are the work of a great art applied to human character. Our true nature can indeed only be brought to light by such art processes, but there is an art which works with nature, and another art which endeavours to supersede it. Only through culture, only through the strenuous effort to conceive things at their best, not as they are, but as they may and ought to be, only through the persistent effort to constrain them to their ideal (that is their most real) shapes, can human character and human society and the works of man become truly natural. Such art does not supersede nature, but is rather nature obtaining its most perfect expression through the consciousness of man. So declares Polixenes in A Winter's Tale:\u2014</p><p>'Nature is made better by no mean,<br>But nature makes that mean; so, over that art,<br>Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art<br>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we <br>marry<br>A gentler scion to the wildest stock;<br>And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race: This is an art<br>Which does mend nature\u2014change it rather: but<br>The art itself is nature.'</p><p>Whitman has not failed to perceive this truth, but he fears that it may be abused. Meddling with nature is a dangerous process. Any idea or model, after which we attempt to shape our humanity, must proceed from some view of human nature, and our views are too often formal and contracted, manufactures turned out of the workshop of the intellect, of which the ultimate product cannot but be a formal and contracted character. But human nature itself is large and incalculable; and, if allowed to grow unconstrained and unperverted, it will exhibit the superb vitality and the unimpeachable rectitude of the perfect animal or blossoming tree. Using natural, then, in the vulgar sense, there are some men more than others a part of nature; men not modelled after an idea remote from the instincts of manhood; vigorous children of the earth, of wholesome activity, passionate, gay, defiant, proud, curious, free, hospitable, courageous, friendly, wilful. In such men Whitman sees the stuff of all that is most precious in humanity. 'Powerful uneducated persons' are the comrades he loves to consort with:\u2014</p><p>'I am enamour'd of growing outdoors;<br>Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the <br>ocean, or woods;<br>Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the <br>wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers <br>of horses;<br>I can eat and sleep with them week in and week <br>out.'</p><p>These are certainly not the persons who engage the imagination in the literature of an aristocracy.</p><p>It must not, however, be supposed that Whitman sets himself against culture. He would, on the contrary, studiously promote culture, but a culture which has another ideal of character than that growth of feudal aristocracies, and which, accepting the old perennial elements of noblest manhood, combines them 'into groups, unities appropriate to the modern, the democratic, the West.' No conception of manhood can be appropriate unless it be of a kind which is suitable not to the uses of a single class or caste, but to those of the high average of men. The qualities of character which are judged of most value by the democratic standard are not extraordinary, rare, exceptional qualities; the typical personality, which the culture sets before itself as its ideal, is one attainable by the average man. The most precious is ever in the common. Such a culture, Whitman holds, will be that of 'the manly and courageous instincts, and loving perceptions, and of self-respect.' Central in the character of the ideal man is the simple, unsophisticated Conscience, the primary moral element. 'If I were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread, respecting the America of our hopes, I should have to point to this particular\u2026. Our triumphant, modern Civilizee, with his all-schooling, and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains.' If Whitman appears to be antagonistic to culture, as we commonly understand or misunderstand the term, to refinement, intellectual acquisition, multiform and delicate sympathies, the critical spirit, it is 'not for absolute reasons, but current ones.' In our times, he believes, refinement and delicatesse 'threaten to eat us up like a cancer\u2026. To prune, gather, trim, conform, and ever cram and stuff, is the pressure of our days\u2026. Never, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholstered Exterior Appearance and show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea of caste, and on the sufficiency of mere outside acquisition\u2014never were glibness, verbal intellect more the test, the emulation\u2014more loftily elevated as head and sample,\u2014than they are on the surface of our Republican States this day.' In antagonism to the conception of culture which bears such fruit as this, Whitman desires one which, true child of America, shall bring joy to its mother, 'recruiting myriads of men, able, natural, perceptive, tolerant, devout, real men, alive and full.' In like manner Whitman's portraits of models of womanly Personality\u2014the young American woman who works for herself and others, who dashes out more and more into real hardy life, who holds her own with unvarying coolness and decorum, who will compare, any day, with superior carpenters, farmers, 'and even boatmen and drivers,' not losing all the while the charm, the indescribable perfume of genuine womanhood, or that resplendent person down on Long Island, known as the Peacemaker, well toward eighty years old, of happy and sunny temperament, a sight to draw near and look upon with her large figure, her profuse snow-white hair, dark eyes, clear complexion, sweet breath, and peculiar personal magnetism\u2014these portraits, he admits, are frightfully out of line from the imported Feudal models\u2014'the stock feminine characters of the current novelists, or of the foreign court poems (Ophelias, Enids, Princesses, or Ladies of one thing or another), which fill the envying dreams of so many poor girls, and are accepted by our young men, too, as supreme ideals of female excellence to be sought after. But I present mine just for a change.'</p><p>In the period of chivalry there existed a beautiful relation between man and man, of which no trace remains in existence as an institution\u2014that of knight and squire. The protecting, encouraging, downward glance of the elder, experienced, and superior man was answered by the admiring and aspiring, upward gaze of the younger and inferior. The relation was founded upon inequality; from the inequality of the parties its essential beauty was derived. Is there any possible relation of no less beauty, corresponding to the new condition of things, and founded upon equality? Yes, there is manly comradeship. Here we catch one of the clearest and most often reiterated notes of Whitman's song. The feelings of equality, individualism, pride, self-maintenance, he would not repress; they are to be as great as the soul is great; but they are to be balanced by the feelings of fraternity, sympathy, self-surrender, comradeship. European Radicals have for the most part been divided into two schools, with the respective watchwords of Equality and Fraternity. Whitman expresses the sentiments of both schools, while his position as poet rather than theorist or politician, saves him from self-devotion to any such socialistic or communistic schemes, as the premature interpretation of the feeling of fraternity into political institutions has given birth to in untimely abortion. One division of 'Leaves of Grass', that entitled 'Calamus' (Calamus being the grass with largest and hardiest spears and with fresh pungent bouquet), is appropriated to the theme of comradeship. And to us it seems impossible to read the poems comprised under this head without finding our interest in the poet Walt Whitman fast changing into hearty love of the man, these poems, through their tender reserves and concealments and betrayals, revealing his heart in its weakness and its strength more than any others. The chord of feeling which he strikes may be old\u2014as old as David and Jonathan\u2014but a fulness and peculiarity of tone are brought out, the like of which have not been heard before. For this love of man for man, as Whitman dreams of it, or rather confidently expects it, is to be no rare, no exceptional emotion, making its possessors illustrious by its singular preciousness, but it is to be widespread, common, unnoticeable.</p><p>'I hear it was charged against me that I <br>sought to destroy institutions;<br>But really I am neither for nor against insti-<br>tutions:<br>(What indeed have I in common with them? <br>Or what with the destruction of them?)<br>Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and <br>in every city of These States, inland and <br>seaboard,<br>And in the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large, that dents the water,<br>Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any <br>argument,<br>The institution of the dear love of comrades.'</p><p>In this growth of America, comradeship, which Whitman looks upon as a sure growth from seed already lying in the soil, he believes the most substantial hope and safety of the States will be found. In it he sees a power capable of counterbalancing the materialism, the selfishness, the vulgarity of American democracy\u2014a power capable of spiritualizing the lives of American men. Many, Whitman is aware, will regard this assurance of his as a dream; but such loving comradeship seems to him implied in the very existence of a democracy, 'without which it will be incomplete, in vain, and incapable of perpetuating itself.' In the following poem the tenderness and ardour of this love of man for man finds expression, but not its glad activity, its joyous fronting the stress and tumultuous agitation of life:\u2014</p><p>'When I heard at the close of the day how my <br>name had been receiv'd with plaudits in <br>the capitol, still it was not a happy <br>night for me that follow'd;<br>And else, when I carous'd, or when my plans<br> were accomplished, still I was not happy;<br>But the day when I rose at dawn from the <br>bed of perfect health, refresh'd, singing, <br>inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,<br>When I saw the full moon in the west grow<br>pale and disappear in the morning light,<br>When I wander'd alone over the beach, and <br>undressing, bathed, laughing with the <br>cool waters, and saw the sun rise,<br>And when I thought how my dear friend, my <br>lover, was on his way coming, O then I <br>was happy;<br>O then each breath tasted sweeter\u2014and all <br>that day my food nourish'd me more\u2014 <br>and the beautiful day pass'd well,<br>And the next came with equal joy\u2014and with <br>the next at evening, came my friend;<br>And that night, while all was still, I heard <br>the waters roll slowly continually up the <br>shores,<br>I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and <br>sands, as directed to me, whispering, to <br>congratulate me,<br>For the one I love most lay sleeping by me <br>under the same cover in the cool night,<br>In the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, <br>his face was inclined toward me,<br>And his arm lay lightly around my breast\u2014 <br>and that night I was happy.'</p><p>Various workings in the poems of Whitman of the influence of the principle of equality as realized in the society which surrounds him have now been traced. No portion of the poet's body of thought and emotion escapes its pervading power, and in a direct and indirect manner it has contributed to determine the character of his feeling with respect to external nature. In the way of crude mysticism Whitman takes pleasure in asserting the equality of all natural objects, and forces, and processes, each being as mysterious and wonderful, each as admirable and beautiful as every other; and as the multitude of men and women, so, on occasions, does the multitude of animals, and trees, and flowers press into his poems with the same absence of selection, the same assertion of equal rights, the same unsearchableness, and sanctity, and beauty, apparent or concealed in all. By another working of the same democratic influence (each man finding in the world what he cares to find) Whitman discovers everywhere in nature the same qualities, or types of the same qualities which he admires most in men. For his imagination the powers of the earth do not incarnate themselves in the forms of god and demi-god, faun and satyr, oread, dryad, and nymph of river and sea\u2014meet associates, allies or antagonists of the heroes of an age, when the chiefs and shepherds of the people were themselves almost demi- gods. But the great Mother\u2014the Earth\u2014is one in character with her children of the democracy, who, at last, as the poet holds, have learned to live and work in her great style. She is tolerant, includes diversity, refuses nothing, shuts no one out; she is powerful, full of vitality, generous, proud, perfect in natural rectitude, does not discuss her duty to God, never apologizes, does not argue, is incomprehensible, silent, coarse, productive, charitable, rich in the organs and instincts of sex, and at the same time continent and chaste. The grass Whitman loves as much as did Chaucer himself; but his love has a certain spiritual significance which Chaucer's had not. It is not the 'soft, swete, smale grass,' embroidered with flowers, a fitting carpet for the feet of glad knights and sportive ladies, for which he cares. In the grass he beholds the democracy of the fields, earthborn, with close and copious companionship of blades, each blade like every other, and equal to every other, spreading in all directions with lusty life, blown upon by the open air, 'coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious.' The peculiar title of his most important volume, 'Leaves of Grass', as Mr. Rossetti has finely observed, 'seems to express with some aptness the simplicity, universality, and spontaneity of the poems to which it is applied.'</p><p>The character of Whitman's feeling with respect to external nature bears witness to the joyous bodily health of the man. His communication with the earth, and sea, and skies, is carried on through senses that are never torpid, and never overwrought beyond the measure of health. He presses close to nature, and will not be satisfied with shy glances or a distant greeting. He enjoys the strong sensations of a vigorous nervous system, and the rest and recuperation which follow. His self-projections into external objects are never morbid; when he employs the 'pathetic fallacy' the world shares in his joyousness; he does not hear in the voices of the waters or of the winds echoes of a miserable egotism, the moan of wounded vanity, or the crying of insatiable lust. He is sane and vigorous. But his relation with nature is not one in which the senses and perceptive faculty have a predominant share. He passes through the visible and sensible things, and pursues an invisible somewhat\u2014</p><p>'A motion and a spirit that impels<br>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br>And rolls through all things;'</p><p>and of this he can never quite possess himself. 'There is [in his poems] a singular interchange of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While he sees men with even abnormal exactness as men, he sees them also 'as trees walking,' and admits us to perceive that the whole show is in a measure spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and profounder reality beneath it, of which it is giving perpetual intimations and auguries.'</p><p>In the direction of religion and philosophy there is in the democratic state of society a strong tendency, as De Tocqueville has shown, towards a pantheistic form of belief, and a strong tendency towards the spirit of optimism. The equality existing between citizens, and the habit of mind which refuses to observe the ancient artificial social distinctions, give the general intellect a turn for reducing things to unity, a passion for comprehending under one formula many objects, and reducing to one cause many and various consequences. Where castes or classes of society exist, one caste or class seems to object singularly little to the perdition of the inferior breeds of the human race\u2014'this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.' The Hind\u00fa could contemplate the fate of a Mlechha, the Jew, that of a Gentile, the Mahommedan, that of a Giaur, without overwhelming concern. But when the vision of a common life of the whole human race has filled the imagination, when a real feeling of solidarity is established between all the members of the great human community, the mind seems to shrink in horror from the suspicion that the final purposes of God or nature, with respect to man, can be other than beneficent. Society, in the democratic condition, is not fixed and desirous of conservation, but perpetually moving, and men's desires (apart from the results of scientific observation) induce them to hope, to conjecture, to believe that this movement is progressive. Biology and natural history with their doctrine of development and evolution, the science of origins with its surveys of the earliest history of our race seems to confirm the conviction, so flattering to men's desires, that nature and man harmoniously work under laws which tend towards a great and fortunate result. The events of the past are interpreted in the light of this conviction. Faith in the future becomes passionate, exists in the atmosphere, and obtaining nutriment from every wind, appears to sustain itself apart from all evidence\u2014that miracle which belongs to every popular faith. The past progress of the race, the great future of the race to match the greatness of its past, the broad dealings of Providence or of natural law with mankind\u2014when the thoughts of these, and feelings corresponding to such thoughts, have occupied the mind and heart, there appears something not only horrible, but something artificial, inconsequent, non-natural, in the notion of endless and fruitless penal suffering. And it is a noteworthy fact\u2014the more remarkable when we bear in mind the Puritanical basis of American religion\u2014that in the many new forms of religion which America has put forth as a tree puts forth leaves, in the many attempts towards the realization of a new conception of our relation to God and to one another, an almost constant element is the belief in the final happiness of all men.</p><p>The religious faith of Whitman, as far as it has definite form, reminds one of that taught in the Pedagogic Institution of Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre, in which from the Three Reverences inculcated, reverence for what is above us, reverence for what is around us, reverence for what is beneath us, springs the highest reverence, reverence for oneself. And with Whitman as with the Pedagogic company perfect reverence casts out fear. But he is not anxious to give his creed a precise form; he is so little interested in the exclusion of heretics that he does not require very accurate symbols and definitions.</p><p>'And I say to mankind, Be not curious about <br>God,<br>For I, who am curious about each, am not curi-<br>ous about God,<br>(No array of terms can say how much I am at <br>peace about God, and about death).'</p><p>Finding the present great and beautiful, contented with the past, but not driven into the past to seek for ideals of human character, and a lost golden age, Whitman has entire confidence in what the future will bring forth. He knows not what the purposes of life are for us, but he knows that they are good. Nowhere in nature can he find announcements of despair, or fixity of evil condition. He is sure that in the end all will be well with the whole family of men, and with every individual of it. The deformed person, the mean man, the infant who died at birth, the 'sacred idiot,' will certainly be brought up with the advancing company of men from whose ranks they have dropped:\u2014</p><p>'The Lord advances, and yet advances;<br>Always the shadow in front\u2014always the reach'd <br>hand, bringing up the laggards.'</p><p>At times this optimism leads Whitman to the entire denial of evil; 'he contemplates evil as, in some sense, not existing, or, if existing, then as being of as much importance as anything else;' in some transcendental way, he believes, the opposition of God and Satan cannot really exist. Practically, however, he is not led astray by any such transcendental reducing of all things to the Divine. Any tendency of a mystical kind to ignore the distinction between good and evil, is checked by his strong democratic sense of the supreme importance of personal qualities, and the inevitable perception of the superiority of virtuous over vicious personal qualities. By one who feels profoundly that the differences between men are determined, not by rank, or birth, or hereditary name or title, but simply by the different powers belonging to the bodies and souls of men, there is small danger of the meaning of bad and good being forgotten. And Whitman never really forgets this. The formation of a noble national character, to be itself the source of all literature, art, statesmanship, is that which above all else he desires. In that character the element of religion must, according to Whitman's ideal, occupy an important place, only inferior to that assigned to moral soundness, to conscience. 'We want, for These States, for the general character, a cheerful, religious fervour, imbued with the ever- present modifications of the human emotions, friendship, benevolence, with a fair field for scientific inquiry [to check fanaticism], the right of individual judgment, and always the cooling influences of material Nature.' These are not the words of one who moves the landmarks of right and wrong, and obscures their boundaries. For Whitman the worth of any man is simply the worth of his body and soul; each gift of nature, product of industry, and creation of art, is valuable in his eyes exactly in proportion to what it can afford for the benefit of body and soul. Only what belongs to these, and becomes a part of them, properly belongs to us\u2014the rest is mere 'material.' This mode of estimating values is very revolutionary, but to us it seems essentially just and moral. The rich man is not he who has accumulated unappropriated matter around him, but he who possesses much of what 'adheres, and goes forward, and is not dropped by death.'</p><p>Personality, character, is that which death cannot affect. Here again Whitman's democratic feeling for personality over-masters his democratic tendency towards pantheism. He clings to his identity and his consciousness of it, and will not be tempted to surrender that consciousness in imagination by the attractions of any form of nirvana. Death, which is a name to him full of delicious tenderness and mystery not without some element of sensuousness curiously blended with it\u2014('O the beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments, for reasons'), is but a solemn and immortal birth:\u2014</p><p>'Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft <br>feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest <br>welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee\u2014I glorify thee above <br>all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must in-<br>deed come, come unfalteringly.'</p><p>From such indications as these, and others that have gone before, the reader must gather, as best he can, the nature of Whitman's religious faith. But the chief thing to bear in mind is that Whitman cares far less to establish propositions than to arouse energy and supply a stimulus. His pupil must part from him as soon as possible, and go upon his own way.</p><p>'I tramp a perpetual journey\u2014(come listen all!)<br>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and <br>a staff cut from the woods;<br>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair;<br>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy;<br>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, or ex-<br>change;<br>But each man and each woman of you I lead <br>upon a knoll,<br>My left hand hooking you round the waist,<br>My right hand pointing to landscapes of conti-<br>nents, and a plain public road.'</p><p>That plain public road each man must travel for himself.</p><p>Here we must end. We have not argued the question which many persons are most desirous to put about Walt Whitman\u2014'Is he a poet at all?' It is not easy to argue such a question in a profitable way. One thing only need here be said,\u2014no adequate impression of Whitman's poetical power can be obtained from this article. A single side of his mind and of his work has been studied, but we have written with an abiding remembrance of the truth expressed by Vauvenargues:\u2014'Lorsque nous croyons tenir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201a par un endroit, elle nous \u00e9chappe par mille autres.'</p>", "date": "July 1871", "year": 1871, "creator": "Edward Dowden", "publication": "The Westminster Review", "citation": "Dowden, Edward [unsigned in original]. \"The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman.\" July 1871.

A man, however, has lately sprung up among them whom his admirers exalt as the greatest poet that ever lived, and his opponents denounce as a literary lunatic, writing, under pretence of verse, neither rhyme, rhythm, nor good sober prose. As in most fierce discussions, so in this concerning the true place of Walt Whitman, both sides are extravagantly wrong. Whitman is neither the greatest poet that ever lived, nor is he a raving madman.</p><p>Walt Whitman is peculiarly an American production. His poems may be said to be essentially filled with an American spirit, to breathe the American air, and to assert the fullest American freedom.</p><p>It is for this reason that many people on this side of the Atlantic will not take the trouble to study him as he deserves to be studied. His ideas, and his manner of expression, jar at the first reading on our old formal notions of what poetry should be, and how it should be expressed.</p><p>Browning is rugged enough, in all conscience; and he pays a heavy penalty of unpopularity for his peculiar style. While Tennyson, and others of the smooth, voluptuous, sensuous school, hold temporary sway over the ears of society, the strong singers of more Spartan mould must bide their time.</p><p>Imagine the feelings of any idle reader who, after having just read the Laureate's \u2018Miller's Daughter,\u2019 or \u2018Oriana,\u2019 carelessly opens Walt Whitman to the following tune, from his \u2018Crossing Brooklyn Ferry\u2019:\u2014</p><p>I.<br>\u2018Flood-tide below me! I watch you face to face; <br>Clouds of the west! sun there half an hour high! <br>I see you also face to face. </p><p>II. <br>\u2018Crowds of men and women attired in the usual <br>costumes! how curious you are to me! <br>On the ferry-boats, the hundreds and hundreds <br>that cross, returning home, are more curious to <br>me than you suppose; <br>And you that shall from years hence, are <br>more to me, and more in my meditations, than <br>you might suppose.</p><p>III. <br>\u2018The impalpable sustenance of me from all things, <br>at all hours of the day; <br>The simple, compact, well-joined scheme\u2014my-<br>self disintegrated, every one disintegrated, yet<br> part of the scheme; <br>The similitudes of the past, and those of the <br>future; <br>The glories strung like beads on my smallest <br>sights and hearings\u2014on the walk in the street, <br>and the passage over the river; <br>The current rushing so swiftly, and swimming <br>with me far away; <br>The others that are to follow me, the ties between <br>me and them; <br>The certainty of others\u2014the life, love, sight, <br>hearing of others.\u2019</p><p>But this is not enough to give an idea of what a shock would happen to the nerves of any ordinary dilletante reader of poetry, and we candidly confess there would be some excuse for immediate dislike of the new poet. The contrast is too startling between the smooth, old-fashioned couplets of our orthodox English verse, and this wild, free, reckless voice of the fields, and the rivers, and the backwoods of far Massachusetts.</p><p>Hence, it may safely be said that it is upon these first openings of his works by inquiring lovers or mere pleasant, mellifluous verse that Walt Whitman has been condemned. The first taste was enough; and it remained for men of broader and more philosophic ideas, who look upon true poetry as something more than fine words, to discover that there really was something, after all, in this wild poet of the prairies.</p><p>The first man of any note to appreciate this novus homo was Ralph Waldo Emerson. The account of the affair by an American writer is curious:\u2014</p><p>\u2018It was about ten years ago that literary circles in and around Boston were startled by the tidings that Emerson\u2014whose incredulity concerning American books was known to be as profound as that of Sydney Smith\u2014had discovered an American poet. Emerson had been for many years our literary banker: paper that he had inspected, coin that he had rung on his counter, would pass safely anywhere.</p><p>\u2018On his table had been laid one day a queerly shaped book, entitled 'Leaves of Grass. By Walt Whitman.' There was also in the front the portrait of a middle-aged man, in the garb of a working man.</p><p>\u2018The Concord philosopher's feelings on perusing this book were expressed in a private letter to its author, which i quote from memory:\u2014</p><p>\u2018'At first, I rubbed my eyes, to find if this new sunbeam might not be an illusion. . . . I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a start.'\u2018</p><p>Praise such as this from the veteran of American literature is no mean recommendation. To no one of his own countrymen\u2014and no one before living, except Carlyle\u2014had Emerson previously written so forcibly. But Emerson's feeling may well be understood by any one who will carefully read\u2014as they assuredly will some day be read\u2014Whitman's poems. Emerson had long lamented, in his own nervous, vigorous fashon, that the American freeman was becoming \u2018timid, imitative, tame,\u2019 from listening too long to \u2018the courtly muses of Europe.\u2019</p><p>And here, in this new man, unlike any man who had ever before written or sung, whichever you like to call it, he fancied he saw a pioneer, as it were, to the Promised Land of a new and distinctive American song. \u2018It is,\u2019 said Emerson of \u2018Leaves of Grass,\u2019 \u2018the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.\u2019</p><p>An able critic has written forcibly on the genius of this first important work of Whitman.</p><p>\u2018The plainness of speech in 'Leaves of Grass' is indeed biblical. From its first sentence\u2014'I celebrate myself'\u2014there starts forth an endless procession of the forms and symbols of life: now funeral, now carnival; or, again, a masquerade of nations, cities, epochs; or the elements, natural and human, fascinating the eye with wonder or dread. To these terrible eyes Maya surrenders\u2014faces, forms, skeletons are unsheathed. Here are the autographs of New York, and of the prairies, savannahs, Ohio, Mississippi, and all powers, good and evil. There is much that is repulsive to the ordinary mind in these things, and in the poems that really express them; but, as huge reptiles help to fashion the pedestal of man\u2014as artists find in griffins and crouching animal forms the fundamental vitality upon which the statue or pillar may repose\u2014one might not unreasonably find in the wild, grotesque forms of Walt Whitman's chants, so instinct with life, the true basis of any shaft, not the duplicate of any raised elsewhere, that American thought is to raise.\u2019</p><p>The aim, purpose, and leading principle of Whitman's productions are best explained in a letter of his own to a friend, in which he says:\u2014</p><p>\u2018I assume that poetry in America needs to be entirely recreated. On examining, with anything like deep analysis, what now prevails in the United States, the whole mass of poetical works, long and short, consist either of the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, or more or less musical verbiage, arising out of a life of depression and enervation, as their result; or else that class of poetry, plays, &c., of which the foundation is feudalism, with its ideas of lords and ladies, its imported standard of gentility, and the manners of European high life below stairs in every line and verse. . . . Instead of mighty and vital breezes, proportionate to our continent, with its powerful races of men, its tremendous historic events, its great oceans, its mountains, and its illimitable prairies, I find a few little silly fans languidly moved by shrunken fingers.\u2019 His ambition is, he continues int he same letter, \u2018to give something to our literature which will be our own; with neither foreign spirit, nor imagery, nor form, but adapted to our case, grown out of our associations, boldly portraying the West, strengthening and intensifying the national soul, and finding the entire fountains of its birth and growth in our own country.\u2019</p><p>How far he will succeed in his purpose time alone can decide. But as a sort of encouragement to our readers to make a further acquaintance for themselves with the oracular expressions of this original genius, we will give a few specimens of what he himself, at least, calls his poems.</p><p>As a rule, Whitman eschews the old style of giving set title to poems. Most of them are merely headed with the opening words of the poems themselves\u2014as, \u2018I was looking a long while,\u2019 \u2018To get betimes in Boston town,\u2019 \u2018When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,\u2019 and so on.</p><p>Mr. Rossetti, however, in his English selection of Whitman's poems, has appended titles of his own, which, for the sake of convenience, we will here adopt.</p><p>The following, entitled \u2018The Past\u2014Present,\u2019 is Walt Whitman in his glory:\u2014</p><p>\u2018I was looking a long while for a clue to the history of the <br>past for myself, and for these chants\u2014and now <br>I have found it. <br>It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, <br>(them I neither accept nor reject); <br>It is no more in the legends than in all else: <br>It is in the present\u2014it is this earth to-day; <br>It is in Democracy\u2014in this America\u2014the Old <br>World also; <br>It is the life of one man or one woman to-day, the <br>average man of to-day; <br>It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts; <br>It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, ma-<br>chinery, politics, creeds, modern improvements, <br>and the interchange of nations: <br>All for the average man of to-day.\u2019</p><p>The following opening of \u2018Years of the Unperformed,\u2019 if not poetry in the hackneyed sense of the term, is the voice of the true prophet:\u2014</p><p>\u2018Years of the unperformed! Your horizon rises. <br>I see it part away for more august dramas: <br>I see not America only\u2014I see not only liberty\u2019s <br>nation, but other nations embattling. <br>I see tremendous entrances and exits, I see new <br>combinations, I see the solidarity of races; <br>I see that force advancing with irresistible power, <br>on the world\u2019s stage. <br>Have the old forces played their parts? Are the <br>acts suitable to them closed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Old Ireland,\u2019 of which we have not space for more than the first stanza, is, we think, very beautiful:\u2014</p><p>\u2018Far hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty, <br>crouching over a grave, an ancient sorrowful <br>mother, <br>Once a queen, now lean and tattered, seated on <br>the ground; <br>Her old white hair drooping dishevelled round <br>her shoulders; <br>At her feet fallen an unused royal harp, <br>Long silent. She, too, long silent\u2014mourning her <br>shrouded hope and heir; <br>Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, be-<br>cause most full of love.\u2019</p><p>Of the political idea conveyed in this we say nothing; but as a picture, it is intensely human.</p><p>There is little rhyme throughout Whitman's \u2018poems,\u2019 and perhaps, some people may be inclined to say, little rhythm either; but that this arises more from Walt's disdain for the mechanical resources of other poets than from any want of a good musical ear may be seen from the following dirge for Abraham Lincoln, which is very touching:\u2014</p><p>\u2018O captain\u2014O captain! our fearful trip is done\u2014<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we <br>sought is won; <br>The port is near, the bells I hear\u2014the people all <br>exulting, <br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim <br>and daring. <br>But heart, heart, heart! <br>Leave you not the little spot<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies, <br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O captain, my captain, rise up and hear the bells; <br>Rise up, for you the flag is flung, for you the <br>bugle trills, <br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you <br>the shores a-crowding, <br>For you they call\u2014the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning. <br>O Captain, dear father! <br>This arm I push beneath you. <br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and <br>still, <br>My father does not feel my arm\u2014he has no pulse <br>nor will; <br>But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage <br>closed and done; <br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won. <br>Exult, O shore, and ring O bells! <br>But I, with silent tread<br>Walk the spot my captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>We have quoted enough, we think, even in these brief extracts, to show that Walt Whitman is more of a poet than his adverse critics will allow. The only excuse for their opposition is, perhaps, that they have not yet learnt to understand the man.</p><p>We confess to sharing the weakness of many who, in studying the genius and intellect of a teacher of men, are anxious also to know all they can of his personal life. A preacher may charm an admiring congregation with the most saintlike of sermons; but it does not follow of necessity that he is not as erring a sinner as any among his flock. The philosopher, like Bacon, may utter the noblest and loftiest sentiments, yet be at the same time the \u2018meanest of mankind.\u2019 So the poet may wake the pulses of men with the purest and most God-like of truths, yet be by no means the most admired and respected personally by those who have the privilege of an acquaintance more intimate than the mere knowledge of his genius. For this reason, after our remarks on the poetry of Walt Whitman, we give a sketch of his personnel by one of his own countrymen, who, while an enthusiastic admirer of the poet, yet seems to speak from his heart:\u2014</p><p>\u2018For years past,\u2019 says Dr. Douglas O'Connor, of Massachusetts, in a pamphlet called the \u2018Good Gray Poet,\u2019 \u2018thousands of people in New York, in Brooklyn, in Boston, in New Orleans, and latterly in Washington, have seen, even as I saw two hours ago, tallying, one might say, with the streets of our American cities, and fit to have for his background and accessories their streaming populations and ample and rich fa\u00e7ades, a man of striking masculine beauty\u2014a poet: powerful and venerable in appearance; large, calm, superbly formed; oftenest clad in the careless, rough, and always picturesque costume of the common people; resembling, and generally taken by strangers for, some great mechanic, or stevedore, or seaman, or grand labourer of one kind or another; and passing slowly in this guise, with nonchalant and haughty steps, along the pavement, with the light and shadows falling around him. The dark sombrero he usually wears was, when I saw him just now\u2014the day being warm\u2014held for the moment in his hands. Righ light, an artist would have chosen, lay upon his uncovered head\u2014majestic, large, Homeric, and set upon his strong shoulders with the grandeur of ancient sculpture. I marked the countenance\u2014serence, proud, cheerful, florid, grave; the brow, seamed with noble wrinkles; the features, massive and handsome, with firm blue eyes; the eyebrows and eyelids especially showing that fulness of arch seldom seen save in the antique busts; the flowing hair and fleecy beard, both very gray, and tempering with a look of age the youthful aspect of one who is but forty-five; the simplicity and purity of his dress, cheap and plain, but spotless, from snowy falling collar to burnished boot, and exhaling faint fragrance; the whole form surrounded with manliness as with a nimbus, and breathing, in its perfect health and vigour, the august charm of the strong. We who have looked upon this figure, or listened to that clear, cheerful, vibrating voice, might smile to think, could we but transcend our age, that we had been thus near to one of the greatest of men.\u2019</p><p>This is warm praise; but the Doctor's own tribute of admiration for the stalwart poet was well seconded by one who was, as friends and enemies alike own, himself a man, in the most honourable sense of the term.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln, seeing him for the first time, from the East Room of the White House, as he passed slowly by, and gazing at him long with that deep eye which read men, said in the quaint, sweet tone which those who have spoken with him will remember, and with a significant emphasis which the type can hardly convey\u2014\u2019Well, he looks like a Man!\u2019</p><p>With a few details of Walt Whitman's life, we will conclude our brief notice of this remarkable man.</p><p>Walt\u2014an abbreviation by himself of Walter, which latter is, we presume, his baptismal name\u2014was born at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, on the 31st of May, 1819. By his father's side he is of English descent; but his mother, whose maiden name was Louisa Van Velsor, was of Dutch extraction.</p><p>The father was a farmer, and afterwards a carpenter and builder, and both the father and mother were strict followers of the great Quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks.  </p><p>Like many other of his countrymen, Whitman has turned his hand, as occasion required, to different trades and occupations. At the age of thirteen he began life as a printer. He was next a teacher in a country school, then a miscellaneous writer on the New York press. Then we find him a newspaper editor in New Orleans; next a printer again; and then, by one of those curious transformations so common to active American life, taking to his father's trade of carpenter and builder. On the breaking out of the civil war, Whitman joined in the dangers of the conflict, but solely with the noble purpose of rendering assistance to the sick and wounded of either side, both in the battle-field and the hospitals. It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded.</p><p>A man of this sort cannot but be entitled to the love and respect of every humane and right-thinking person, apart from his intellectual merits altogether.</p><p>Mr. Whitman holds, we believe, at the present time, a pretty lucrative post at one of the American consulates.</p>", "date": "June 1 1872", "year": 1872, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "Once a Week.

His poems have suffered the usual fate of such abnormal productions; it has been considered that admiration of them must be a kind of voluntary eccentricity, a gratuitous flourish in the face of respectability and orthodoxy. And it cannot be denied that he has not altogether escaped that worst of all calamities to a literary man, the admiration of the incompetent. It is true that he has been praised, with discrimination as well as with emphasis, by Mr. Swinburne; but unfortunately Mr. Swinburne's praise is mainly a passport to the favour of those who would be likely to appreciate Whitman without any passport at all. The testimony of his other panegyrists has not been a little weakened: in some by supposed national or political prejudices; in others, as already mentioned, by notorious literary incompetence. </p><p>It is very much to be hoped that the publication of this new edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' may be the occasion of a deeper and wider study of the American poet, a study which may be carried on purely as a matter of literature and not with any lurking intention to illustrate preconceived ideas as to the merits or demerits of Walt Whitman's principles, practice, or mode of expression.</p><p>The volume now before us is very different in outward appearance from the edition of fourteen years ago, which has so long caught the eye by its dissimilarity to its brother occupants of the bookshelf. The old cloth boards, deeply and mystically stamped with strange emblems, have given way to an outer coat of sober and decent green suitable to any modern English poem. Thick paper and bold type have yielded to the exigencies of increased matter. The very titles of some of the poems have made concessions to conventionality. \u2018Enfants d'Adam\u2019 have transplanted themselves into plain English; \u2018Proto-Leaf\u2019 has disappeared from the contents; and \u2018A Boston Ballard the 78th year T.S.,\u2019 which used to excite vague and uncomfortable chronological uncertainties, has become, to the great solace of the reader, \u2018A Boston Ballard, 1854.\u2019 Altogether the book might seem to a too-fanciful critic to have abandoned, at least in externals, its former air of youthful and exuberant provocation, and to demand, more soberly if not less confidently, the maturer consideration of the student of letters.</p><p>But it is still as ever far more easy to argue for or against the book than to convey a clear account of it to persons not acquainted with it. Although the contents are divided and subdivided by the headings which the author has prefixed, yet these headings convey but little idea of what comes under them, sometimes indeed have very little reference to it. Nor is the connection of the different divisions of the work and their interdependence more obvious. It may be easy to explain the meaning of \u2018Children of Adam,\u2019 or \u2018Passage to India,\u2019 and some others; but what shall we make of \u2018Calamus,\u2019 or of 'Leaves of Grass' itself? For the answers we must refer the reader to the book that it may give its own reply.</p><p>Moreover, the poet has in this edition availed himself of the incorporation of \u2018Drumtaps\u2019 and other recently published matter, to dispose the whole contents of the volume into a new order, and to make many additions, alterations, and transpositions in individual poems. These changes are for the most part, as it appears to us, decided improvements, and the whole work posses at present a unity and a completeness which are no small advantage. There are few poets who require to be studied as a whole so much as Walt Whitman\u2014quotations and even tolerably extensive selections will not do\u2014and it is a great gain to be directed by the author himself as to the order in which he would have us conduct the study.</p><p>It is not difficult to point out the central thesis of Walt Whitman's poetical gospel. It is briefly this: the necessity of the establishment of a universal republic, or rather brotherhood of men. And to this is closely joined another, or rather a series of others, indicating the type of man of which this universal republic is to consist, or perhaps which it is to produce. The poet's language in treating the former of these two positions is not entirely uniform; sometimes he speaks as a federation of nations, sometimes as if mankind at large were to gravitate towards the United States, and to find in them the desired Utopia. But the constitution of the United States, at least that constitution as it ought to be, is always and uniformly represented as a sufficient and the only sufficient political means of attaining this Utopia, nay, as having to some extent already presented Utopia as a fact. Moreover, passing to the second point, the ideal man is imaged as the ideal Yankee, understanding that word of course as it is understood in America, not in Europe. He is to be a rather magnificent animal, almost entirely uncultured (this is not an unfair representation, although there are to be found certain vague panegyrics on art, and especially on music), possessing a perfect physique, well nourished and clothed, affectionate towards his kind, and above all things firmly resolved to admit no superior. As is the ideal man, so is the ideal woman to be. Now it may be admitted frankly and at once, that this is neither the creed nor the man likely to prove attractive to many persons east of the Atlantic. If it be said that the creed is a vague creed, and the man a detestable man, there will be very little answer attempted. Many wonderful things will doubtless happen \u2018when,\u2019 as the poet says, \u2018through these States walk a hundred million of superb persons;\u2019 but it must be allowed that there is small prospect of any such procession. One is inclined for very many sound reasons, and after discarding all prejudices, to opine that whatever salvation may await the world may possibly come from quarters other than from America. Fortunately, however, admiration for a creed is easily separable from admiration for the utterances and expression of that creed, and Walt Whitman as a poet is not difficult to disengage from Walt Whitman as an evangelist and politician. The keyword of all his ideas and of all his writings is universality. His Utopia is one which shall be open to everybody; his ideal of man and woman one which shall be attainable by everybody; his favourite scenes, ideas, subjects, those which everybody, at least to some extent, can enjoy and appreciate. He cares not that by this limitation he may exclude thoughts and feelings, at any rate phases of thoughts and feeling, infinitely choicer and higher than any which he admits. To express this striving after universality he has recourse to methods both unusual and (to most readers) unwelcome. The extraordinary jumbles and strings of names, places, employments, which deface his pages, and which have encouraged the profane to liken them to auctioneers' catalogues or indexes of encyclopaedias, have no other object than to express this universal sympathy, reaching to the highest and penetrating to the lowest forms of life. The exclusion of culture, philosophy, manners, is owing also to this desire to admit nothing but what is open to every human being of ordinary faculty and opportunities. Moreover it is to this that we may fairly trace the prominence in Whitman's writings of the sexual passion, a prominence which has given rise, and probably will yet give rise, to much unphilosophical hubbub. This passion, as the poet has no doubt observed, is almost the only one which is peculiar to man as man, the presence of which denotes virility if not humanity, the absence of which is a sign of abnormal temperament. Hence he elevates it to almost the principal place, and treats of it in a manner somewhat shocking to those who are accustomed to speak of such subjects (we owe the word to Southey) enfarinhadamente. As a matter of fact, however, the treatment, though outspoken, is eminently \u2018clean,\u2019 to use the poet's own word; there is not a vestige of prurient thought, not a syllable of prurient language. Yet it would be a great mistake to suppose that sexual passion occupies the chief place in Whitman's estimation. There is according to him something above it, something which in any ecstasies he fails not to realize, something which seems more intimately connected in his mind with the welfare of mankind, and the promotion of his ideal republic. This is what he calls \u2018robust American love.\u2019 He is never tired of repeating \u2018I am the poet of comrades\u2019\u2014Socrates himself seems renascent in his apostle of friendship. In the ears of a world (at least on this side the Atlantic) incredulous of such things, he reiterates the expressions of Plato to Aster, of Socrates respecting Charmides, and in this respect fully justifies (making allowance for altered manners) Mr. Symonds' assertion of his essentially Greek character, an assertion which most students of Whitman will heartily endorse. But we must again repeat that it is not so much in the matter as in the manner of his Evangel that the strength of Whitman lies. It is impossible not to notice his exquisite descriptive faculty, and his singular felicity in its use. Forced as he is, both by natural inclination and in the carrying out of his main idea, to take note of the \u2018actual earth's equalities,\u2019 he has literally filled his pages with the song of birds, the hushed murmur of waves, the quiet and multiform life of the forest and meadow. And in these descriptions he succeeds in doing what is most difficult, in giving us the actual sense or circumstance as it impressed him and not merely the impression itself. This is what none but the greatest poets have ever save by accident done, and what Whitman does constantly and with a sure hand. \u2018You shall,\u2019 he says at the beginning of his book: </p><p>\u2018You shall no longer take things at second or third <br>hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed<br>on the spectres in books: <br>\u2018You shall not look through my eyes either, nor<br>take things from me: <br>\u2018You shall listen to all sides, and filter them from<br>yourself.\u2019 </p><p>But affluent as his descriptions are, there are two subjects on which he is especially eloquent, which seem indeed to intoxicate and inspire him the moment he approaches them. These are Death and the sea. In the latter respect he is not, indeed, peculiar, but accords with all poets of all times, and especially of this time. But in his connection of the two ideas (for the one always seems to suggest the other to him), and in his special devotion to Death, he is more singular. The combined influence of the two has produced what is certainly the most perfect specimen of his work, the \u2018Word out of the Sea\u2019 (in this edition, it has, we are sorry to see, lost its special title and become the first merely of \u2018Sea-Shore Memories\u2019) Unfortunately it is indivisible, and its length precludes the possibility of quotation. But there is another poem almost equally beautiful, which forms part of \u2018President Lincoln's Burial Hymn,\u2019 and for this space may perhaps be found:\u2014</p><p><em>\u2018DEATH-CAROL.</em> <br>Come, lovely and soothing Death, <br>Undulate round the world serenely arriving, arriving, <br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each, <br>Sooner or later, delicate Death. </p><p>Prais'd be the fathomless universe, <br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge <br>curious; <br>And for love, sweet love. But praise! praise! praise! <br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death. </p><p>Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet, <br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest wel-<br>come? <br>Then I chant it for thee\u2014I glorify thee above all: <br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, <br>come unfalteringly. </p><p>Approach, strong Deliveress! <br>When it is so\u2014when thou hast taken them, I joyously <br>sing the dead, <br>Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee, <br>Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death. </p><p> From me to thee glad serenades, <br>Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee\u2014adornments <br>and feastings for thee; <br>And the sights of the open landscape and the high <br>spread sky are fitting, <br>And life and the fields and the huge and thoughtful <br>night. </p><p>The night, in silence under many a star; <br>The ocean-shore, and the husky whispering wave <br>whose voice I know; <br>And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veiled <br>death, <br>And the body gratefully nestling closer to thee. </p><p>Over the tree-tops I float thee a song! <br>Over the rising and sinking waves\u2014over the myriad <br>fields and the prairies wide; <br>Over the dense-packed cities all and the teeming <br>wharves and ways, <br>I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death!\u2019 </p><p>It is easy enough to connect this cultus of Death and the pantheism which necessarily accompanies it, with the main articles of Whitman's creed. Death is viewed as the one event of great solemnity and importance which is common to all\u2014the one inevitable yet not commonplace incident in every life, however commonplace; and further, it must not be overlooked that Death is pre-eminently valuable in such a system as this, in the capacity of reconciler, ready to sweep away all rubbish. The cheeriest of optimists with the lowest of standards cannot pretend to assert or expect that everyone will live the ideal life\u2014but Death pays all scores and obliterates all mistakes.</p><p>There remains, however, still to be considered a point not least in importance\u2014the vehicle which Whitman has chosen for the conveyance of these thoughts. He employs, as most people who know anything at all about him, neither rhyme nor even regular metre; the exceptions to this rule occurring among his more recent poems are few and insignificant. A page of his work has little or no look of poetry about it; it is not, indeed, printed continuously, but it consists of versicles, often less in extent than a line, sometimes extending to many lines. Only after reading these for some time does it become apparent that, though rhyme and metre have been abandoned, rhythm has not; and moreover, that certain figures and tricks of language occur which are generally considered more appropriate to poetry than to prose. The total effect produced is dissimilar to any of the previous attempts which have been made to evade the shackles of the metre and rhyme, while retaining the other advantages of poetical form and diction. Whitman's style differs very much from that of such efforts as Baudelaire's 'Petits Po\u00e8ms en Prose,\u2019 for from these all rhythm, diction, and so forth not strictly appropriate to prose is conscientiously excluded. It is more like the polymetres of the poet's namesake Walt in Richter's 'Flegeljahre,' except that these latter being limited to the expression of a single thought are not divided into separate limbs or verses. Perhaps the likeness which is presented to the mind most strongly is that which exists between our author and the verse divisions of the English Bible, especially in the poetical books, and it is not unlikely that the latter did actually exercise some influence in moulding the poet's work. It is hard to give a fair specimen of it in the way of quotation\u2014that already given is not representative, being too avowedly lyrical\u2014and the rhythm is as a rule too varying, complex, and subtle to be readily seized except from a comparison of many instances. Perhaps, however, the following stanza from \u2018Children of Adam\u2019 may convey some idea of it:\u2014</p><p>\u2018I have perceived that to be with those I like is <br>enough; <br>To stop in company with the rest at evening is <br>enough; <br>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, <br>laughing flesh is enough; <br>To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my <br>arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a <br>moment\u2014what is this then? <br>I do not ask any more delight\u2014I swim in it as in <br>a sea. <br>There is something in staying close to men and women, <br>and looking on them, and in the contact and <br>odour of them, that pleases the soul well; <br>All things please the soul\u2014but these please the <br>soul well.\u2019 </p><p>It will be observed that the rhythm is many-centered, that it takes fresh departures as it goes on. The poet uses freely alliteration, chiasmus, antithesis, and especially the retention of the same word or words to begin and end successive lines, but none of these so freely as to render it characteristic. The result, though perhaps uncouth at first sight and hearing, is a medium of expression by no means wanting in excellence, and certainly well-adapted for Whitman's purposes. Strange as it appears to a reader familiarised with the exquisite versification of modern England or France, it is by no means in disagreeable contrast therewith, being at least in its earlier forms (for in some of the later poems reminiscences of the English heroic, of Longfellow's hexameters, and even of Poe's stanzas occur) singularly fresh, light, and vigorous. Nor should the language pass unmentioned\u2014for though of course somewhat Transatlantic in construction and vocabulary, it is not offensively American. The chief blemish in the eyes of a sensitive critic is an ugly trick of using foreign words such as \u2018Libertad\u2019 for liberty, \u2018habitan of the Alleghanies,\u2019 \u2018to become \u00e9l\u00e8ve of mine,\u2019 \u2018with references to ensemble,\u2019 and so forth; but even this does not occur very frequently. Few books abound more in \u2018jewels five words long;\u2019 it is hardly possible to open a page without lighting upon some happy and memorable conceit, expression, thought, such as this of the grass:</p><p>\u2018Itit is the handkerchief of the Lord; <br>A scented gift and remembranceremembrancer designedly dropt, <br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, <br>that we may see and remark, and say Whose?\u2019 </p><P>Or this of children's love to a father: </p><p>\u2018They did not love him by allowance,they loved him <br>with personal love.\u2019 </p><p>Or again of the grass: </p><p>\u2018And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of <br>graves.\u2019 </p><p>Such in matter and in manner are Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass,' and there only remains to be added one recommendation to their study. The book, aggressive and vain-glorious as it seems, is in reality remarkably free from vituperativeness of tone. Hardly to some \u2018eunuchs, consumptive and genteel persons\u2019 is strong language used, and after all it rests with every reader to class himself with these. Amid all the ecstatic praise of America there is no abuse of England; amid all the excitement of the poems on the War there is little personal abuse of the Secessionists. No Englishman, no one indeed, whether American or Englishman, need be deterred from reading this book, a book the most unquestionable in originality, if not the most unquestioned in excellence, that the United States have yet sent us. </p><P> GEORGE SAINTSBURY. </p>", "date": "October 10 1874", "year": 1874, "creator": "George Saintsbury", "publication": "The Academy", "citation": "Saintsbury, George. \"Leaves of Grass.\" 10 October 1874.

If I ever saw anything in print that deserved to be characterized as atrociously bad, it is the poetry of Walt Whitman; and the three critics of repute, Dr. Dowden, Mr. W. Rossetti, and Mr. Buchanan, who have praised his performances, appear to me to be playing off on the public a well-intentioned, probably good-humoured, but really cruel hoax. I shall state briefly what I found the so-called poetry to be, presenting a few samples of Whitman's work: if these are such as the English public will regard with any other feelings but scorn and disgust, I for one have mistaken the character of my countrymen.</p><p>The \u2018Leaves of Grass,\u2019 under which designation Whitman includes all his poems, are unlike anything else that has passed among men as poetry. They are neither in rhyme nor in any measure known as blank verse; and they are emitted in spurts or gushes of unequal length, which can only by courtesy be called lines. Neither in form nor in substance are they poetry; they are inflated, wordy, foolish prose; and it is only because he and his eulogists call them poems, and because I do not care to dispute about words, that I give them the name. Whitman's admirers maintain that their originality is their superlative merit. I undertake to show that it is a mere knack, a \u2018trick of singularity,\u2019 which sound critics ought to expose and denounce, not to commend.</p><p>The secret of Whitman's surprising newness\u2014the principle of his conjuring trick\u2014is on the surface. It can be indicated by the single word, extravagance. In all cases he virtually, or consciously, puts the question, What is the most extravagant thing which is here in my power to say? What is there so paradoxical, so hyperbolical, so nonsensical, so indecent, so insane that no man ever said it before, that no man would say it now, and that therefore it may be reckoned on to create a sensation? He announced himself as poet with a contemptuous allusion\u2014we shall see its terms farther on\u2014to those poets whose fame has shed lustre on America, and he expressly declares war against all regulated and reasonable things.</p><p>\u2018I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them,<br>I am more resolute because all have denied me, than I could ever have been had all <br>accepted me; <br>I heed not, and have never heeded either experience, cautions, majorities, nor <br>ridicule. <br>And the threat of what is called hell is little or nothing to me; <br>And the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me;\u2019</p><p>Goethe said that the assent of even one man confirmed him infinitely in his opinion; Whitman is only the more peremptory in his egotism when he finds that people of sense disagree with him. In spite, however, of his Fakir-like gesticulations, his extravagance generally continues dull.</p><p>\u2018Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from; <br>The scent of these armpits aroma finer than prayer; <br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds. <br>If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body or <br>any part of it.\u2019</p><p>Mr. Ruskin insists that there are errors and blemishes of such exceeding and immedicable vileness that, if you find a single instance of their occurrence in the work of an artist, you may, with assured heart, turn once and for ever from his pictures, confident that, since the tree is corrupt, its fruit will always be noxious. Whether Mr. Ruskin is absolutely right as to the fact I shall not undertake to decide; but I challenge Professor Dowden, Mr. W. Rossetti, and Mr. Buchanan, to produce, from any poet of acknowledged excellence, a single passage so offensively silly as the preceding. I beg readers to force themselves to look well at the lines. It is a man who talks of himself as divine inside and out, and drivels nauseously about the scent of his armpits, whom we are called upon to welcome as a great poet. Whitman, as Professor Dowden will by-and-by attest for us, prints incomparably more indecent things than this, but the words are thoroughly characteristic. They have exactly the originality of Whitman, and we cannot refuse to admit that they are unique.</p><p>One of the most favourite extravagances of Whitman is extravagant conceit, and he occasionally indulges it in forms which in England would simply be regarded as evidence of idiocy.</p><p>\u2018I conned old times; <br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters: <br>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might return and study me!\u2019</p><p>Much good would it do them. Equally silly, but more pompous in its silliness, is what follows:\u2014</p><p>\u2018The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place; <br>The suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, are in their place; <br>The palpable is in its place, and the impalpable is in its place.\u2019</p><p>Do men of talent mumble truisms like this? And is there any excuse for such pretentious twaddle after the doctrine that everything is right in its own place and time has been stated, with a pith and quaint humour not likely to be surpassed, by the author of the Proverbs of Solomon?</p><p>Whitman's writings abound with reproductions of the thoughts of other men, spoiled by obtuseness or exaggeration. He can in no case give the finely correct application of a principle, or indicate the reserves and exceptions whose appreciation distinguishes the thinker from the dogmatist: intense black and glaring white are his only colours. The mysterious shadings of good into evil and evil into good, the strange mingling of pain with pleasure, and of pleasure with pain, in the web of human affairs, have furnished a theme for musing to the deepest minds of our species. But problems that were felt to be insoluble by Shakespeare and Goethe have no difficulty for this bard of the West. Extravagant optimism and extravagant pessimism, both wrong and shallow, conduct him to the \u2018entire denial of evil\u2019 (the words are Professor Dowden's), to the assertion that \u2018there is no imperfection in the present and can be none in the future,\u2019 and to the vociferous announcement that success and failure are pretty much the same. </p><p>\u2018Have you heard that it was good to gain the day? <br>I say also it is good to fall-battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won. <br>I beat and pound for the dead; <br>I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them. <br>Vivas to those who have fail'd! <br>And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea! <br>And to those themselves who sank in the sea! <br>And to all generals that lost engagements! and all overcome heroes! <br>And the numberless unknown heroes, equal to the greatest heroes known.\u2019</p><p>Mr. Carlyle's lifelong effort to show that the success of the hero is, on the whole, a proof that he deserves to succeed, has, it seems, been a waste of power. \u2018Vivas to those who have failed!\u2019 \u2018Hurrah for the gallows!\u2019 I do not know that a better illustration could be found of the evil effect of Whitman's obliterating extravagance than these lines. They contain the blurred and distorted lineaments of a mysterious and melancholy truth. Noble innocence and courage have been indeed laid low; beauty and virtue have in every age been seen \u2018walking hand in hand the downward slope to death;\u2019 and all hearts thrill at the thought of murdered Naboth and his sons, and of Lear hanging over the white lips of Cordelia. But the soul of the pathos in all these instances lies in their exceptional nature. It is because we feel that they violate the law of justice, the fundamental ordinances of human society, that they move us. It is because, whether from a veracious instinct, or from a blissful illusion, we believe success to be the natural reward of merit, and happiness the natural guerdon of virtue, that we are agonized by the death-shrieks of Desdemona or the slow torture of Joan of Arc. If human affairs were a mad welter of causeless failure and unmerited success, as they are represented in this passage of Whitman's, there could be no such thing as pathos either in life or in art.</p><p>Whitman is never more audaciously extravagant than when he takes some well-known poetical idea, and inflates it into bombast.</p><p>\u2018Dazzling and tremendous, how quick the sunrise would kill me, <br>If I could not now and always send sunrise out of me.\u2019</p><p>It is a beautiful and touching thought that our joy brightens the summer flowers, and that our sorrow lends mournfulness to winter's snow; but it is mere extravagant nonsense to say that sunrise would kill a man unless he sent sunrise out of him. The sun has been the prey of poetical charlatans time out of mind, and Whitman cruelly bedrivels the long-suffering luminary:\u2014</p><p>\u2018I depart in air\u2014I shake my white locks at the runaway sun; <br>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\u2019</p><p>It would be interesting to know what meaning Whitman's admirers attach to the second of these lines; to my thinking it is not one whit more rational, and infinitely less amusing, than the talk of the walrus and the carpenter in \u2018Alice through the Looking-Glass.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! What is that you <br>express in your eyes? <br>It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\u2019</p><p>Whitman's eulogists tell us that he reads Shakspeare, Homer, and the Bible. Can they pretend to believe it to be anything but fantastic affectation to say that there is more in the eyes of oxen than in these? Whitman must have been consciously affected when he wrote the words: they are stupid as affectation, incredible as anything else. But the brutes are rather a favourite theme with our poet.</p><p>\u2018I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contained; <br>I stand and look at them long and long. <br>They do not sweat and whine about their condition; <br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins; <br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God; <br>Not one is dissatisfied\u2014not one is demented with the mania of owning things; <br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago; <br>Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.\u2019</p><p>Wise men have long been, and are likely to be, content to learn from the bee and the ant; but neither the sage of the past nor the scientific man of the present can have anything to say for such teaching as this of Whitman's. His statements are neither accurate nor sagacious; they are a confused echo, extravagantly absurd, of teachings which he has not understood. Patiently and closely observant of the animals, Mr. Darwin and his followers have shown that they are much more like men than used to be thought; that they have, in germ, almost all human passions, as well as the institutions of marriage and property; that they exhibit in a pronounced form the human failings of jealousy, hatred, revenge, and cunning, and some faint adumbration of the human virtues of tenderness, faithfulness, and self-sacrifice. But it is a wild caricature of Darwin's teaching to panegyrize the animals for those qualities in which they are markedly below humanity; and there is curious infelicity in combining with this vague panegyric the particular libel of charging them with lack of industry, a virtue, which, on pain of death, they are bound to exhibit. \u2018In beetledom are no poor laws,\u2019 and the beast that will not seek its livelihood perishes out of hand. \u2018Loafing and making poems,\u2019 which Whitman describes as his favourite modes of existence, are privileges or perversities peculiar to human nature. Nor would Whitman have learned from Darwin the pitiful extravagance of despising, or affecting to despise, human qualities for no reason, suggested or implied, but because they are human. There is no apparent reason why it should be more contemptible for men to build temples than for crows to build nests; and since it has been in all ages and generations a habit with mankind to discuss their duty to God, it would have been less inhumanly insolent in Whitman to evince some respect for the practice than to say that it turns him sick. The sneer about weeping in the dark for sins might have been expressly directed against one of the best known verses of Goethe, a man not given to sentimental brooding or self-questioning, but who knew that tears shed at midnight on solitary beds are not unpleasing to \u2018the heavenly powers.\u2019</p><p>Let it not be thought, however, that because Whitman speaks scornfully of duty to God and of sin, he never praises religion. Self-contradiction is one of the commonest freaks of affectation, and Whitman never hesitates to contradict himself. He oscillates, in fact, from extreme to extreme, and parades now this extravagance, now that, consistent only in avoidance of the golden mean. We have seen that it makes him sick to hear men discussing their duty to God. His extravagance in its pious tune is almost equally offensive.</p><p>\u2018I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these states must be their religion; <br>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur: <br>(Nor character, nor life worthy the name, without religion; <br>Nor land, nor man, nor woman, without Religion.)\u2019</p><p>This is just as silly as to praise pigs and foxes for not worshipping God. Here is another illustration of Whitman's habit of exaggerating truth or half-truth into falsehood.</p><p>\u2018I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,<br>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, <br>And the tree-toad is a chef-d'\u0153uvre for the highest, <br>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, <br>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery, <br>And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue, <br>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\u2019</p><p>This is exceptionally good for Whitman. Several of the lines have a picturesque felicity. So recently as a quarter of a century ago they might have passed for true science and sound theology; but progress in understanding the constitution of nature has within the specified period been unprecedentedly rapid; truths which, five-and-twenty years ago, were but as streaks of pale crimson on the horizon, have flashed into general recognition; and the natural theology which revelled in talk like this, about the miracles of nature and the impotence of man, is irrevocably superseded. Those who have read with any carefulness in modern science know that throughout nature there is no perfection discoverable by man; everything is in perpetual change, perpetual movement; and the \u2018type of perfect,\u2019 of which Plato dreamed and Tennyson has sung, can be found neither in mouse nor in mountain. It has been recognized that man invents, and that nature, with her task set her at every point by mechanical necessity, does not invent. The hinge in the hand does not put machinery to scorn; and Helmholtz, without incurring the charge of arrogance from any scientific man, pronounces the eye an instrument \u2018full of defects.\u2019 The line about the mouse convincing sextillions of infidels is a mere platitude of the kind for which Paley used to stand sponsor; and we have to recollect that if the sextillions of infidels, when convinced by the miraculous mouse, began to discuss their duty to God, they would immediately make Mr. Whitman sick.</p><p>It must be confessed that this last would be a frame of mind or of body much more customary with him than that in which he points out the unreasonableness of infidels in declining to be \u2018staggered\u2019 by mice. Fierce disdain for faith in God, except as a phase of human fancying, is one of his recurrent moods, and though he may not express it in words, there is no maxim which he more energetically enforces than this\u2014\u2019Reverence nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Magnifying and applying come I,<br>Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, <br>Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah; <br>Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson; <br>Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha; <br>In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved, <br>With Odin, and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and every idol and image; <br>Taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent more.\u2019</p><p>With a flourish of his pen, he accounts for and effaces all gods.</p><p>\u2018What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but that man or <br>woman is as good as God,<br>And that there is no God any more divine than yourself?\u2019</p><p>It is possible to hold with candid intelligence, and to teach without irreverence, the doctrine of man's divinity. The higher self of Mr. Matthew Arnold, the heroic in man of Carlyle, the rightly and perfectly developed humanity of Goethe, may, without much practical mischief, be an object of admiration to the pitch of worship. But theoretically the insanest, and practically the most pernicious of all faiths or no-faiths, is the crude self-worship, the deification of the profanum vulgus [vulgar crowd], which, in so far as it admits of definition, is the creed of Whitman. Until I examined his book, I did not know that the most venomously malignant of all political and social fallacies\u2014that \u2018one man is as good as another\u2019\u2014had been deliberately taught in print. \u2018The messages of great poets,\u2019 says Whitman, in his preface, \u2018to each man and woman are, Come to us on equal terms\u2014only then can you understand us. We are no better than you; what we enclose you enclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy. Did you suppose there could be only one Supreme? We affirm there can be unnumbered supremes, and that one does not countervail another, any more than one eyesight countervails another; and that men can be good or grand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them.\u2019 Neither in Goethe nor in Carlyle will Whitman find anything but detestation for the sentiment of these words. Those men might teach hero-worship; he teaches self-worship, and fool-worship. Goethe said that poets raised men to the gods, and brought down the gods to men; but that every man was himself as good as either god or poet, Goethe would have denied with keenest brilliancy of scorn. Carlyle bade men reverence the hero, discern the heroic in man as constituting his true majesty, detect and honour it under all disguises, refuse to accept any sham heroism, however dignified, in its place; but so disgusted was he to find that his unmasking of sham kings and nobles was being mistaken for a doctrine of anarchic levelling and the kingship of blockheads and scamps, that in too violent recoil, he has latterly insisted that the rule of one despot is better than that of multitudinous fools, each fool proclaiming his own \u2018supremacy.\u2019 It is because of their subtle and pervasive flattery of the mob that Whitman's writings are not harmless as they are worthless, but poisonously immoral and pestilent.</p><p>Whitman is an intrepid destroyer of other people's thoughts, but he sometimes speaks a language wholly his own. No other human being would have said this about \u2018touch:\u2019\u2014</p><p>\u2018Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch! <br>Did it make you ache so, leaving me? <br>Parting track'd by arriving\u2014perpetual payment of perpetual loan, <br>Rich, showering rain, and recompense richer afterward: <br>Sprouts take and accumulate\u2014stand by the curb prolific and vital: <br>Landscapes projected, masculine, full-sized and golden.\u2019</p><p>Thoughts quite his own being rare with him, he hugs them accordingly. No one, I suppose, will dispute his paternity of the thought, or rather the conceit, that grass is \u2018the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\u2019 In my opinion it is a far-fetched and stupid conceit, but it might have passed without blame in half a line, if the reader's imagination had been left to make the best of it. Whitman wire-draws it thus:\u2014</p><p>\u2018Tenderly will I use you, curling grass<br>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men, <br>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them; <br>It may be you are from old people, and from women, or from offspring taken out of <br>their mother's laps, <br>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers, <br>Darker than the colourless beards of old men; <br>Dark to come from under the faint-red roofs of mouths. <br>O, I perceive after all so many uttering tongues! <br>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\u2019</p><p>If this is not mawkish there is no passage known to me in literature deserving to be so characterized.</p><p>Whitman's \u2018poetry\u2019 contains a vast deal about himself. \u2018I celebrate myself,\u2019 he frankly remarks. He professes to \u2018inaugurate\u2019 a religion, of which the one duty, the sole worship, is to be the \u2018dear love of comrades,\u2019 and he speaks with the authority of a founder of a new church.</p><p>\u2018No dainty dolce affettuoso I; <br>Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived, <br>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the universe; <br>For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.\u2019 </p><p>The two last lines either mean nothing at all, or announce that Whitman is a god. Whichever alternative is chosen, the man is a demonstrated quack.</p><p>Take another piece of self-portraiture.</p><p>\u2018Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the <br>beams, <br>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, <br>I and this mystery, here we stand.\u2019</p><p>Are these the words of a sane man? Is there common sense in saying that you stand plumb in the uprights, well entretied, strong as a horse, electrical, and side by side with a mystery?</p><p>If there is anything in Whitman decidedly better than mere extravagant affectation, anything that may claim the dignity of legitimate mannerism, it is a certain feeling for magnitude, and amplitude of mental vision and descriptive grasp. America he discerns to be a very large place, the United States a republic of federated nations, the Mississippi an immense river; and he is impressed with the idea that a specially redundant and sonorous style is appropriate to these conditions. This feeling for magnitude might be of value if associated with consummate power, if dominated by a fine sense of proportion, grace, and order. But an itch of hugeness has much more frequently aped than evidenced the strength of genius. Every one familiar with the history of art is aware that a multitude of bad painters have betrayed their badness by spasmodic aspiration after bigness, vapouring about their capacity to rival Angelo and Tintoret, if they had only walls large enough to display their conceptions. When they were permitted to work on their chosen scale, they did nothing but smear acres of canvas. It would be an insult to the memory of Barry or Haydon to compare them with Walt Whitman; but the long lists of names, the auctioneer catalogues, the accumulation of words out of all proportion to ideas, which made up the body of Whitman's poems, recall their vain attempt to prove themselves great painters by using very large brushes and filling very large frames. Whitman, however, must speak for himself. Here is part of a birds-eye view with which he favours us of sailors and their doings throughout the world:\u2014</p><p>\u2018I behold the mariners of the world; <br>Some are in storms\u2014some in the night, with the watch on the look-out; <br>Some drifting helplessly\u2014some with contagious diseases. <br>I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in clusters in port, some on their <br>voyages; <br>Some double the Cape of Storms\u2014some Cape Verde, others Cape Guardafui, Bon, or <br>Bajadore; <br>Others Dondra Head-others pass the Straits of Sundra\u2014others Cape Lopatka\u2014 <br>others Behring's Straits; <br>Others Cape Horn\u2014others sail the Gulf of Mexico, or along Cuba, or Hayti\u2014others <br>Hudson's Bay, or Baffin Bay; <br>Others pass the Straits of Dover\u2014others enter the Wash-others the Frith of Solway <br>\u2014others round Cape Clear\u2014others the Land's End; <br>Others traverse the Zuyder Zee, or the Scheldt; <br>Others add to the exits and entrances at Sandy Hook; <br>Others to the comers and goers at Gibraltar, or the Dardanelles; <br>Others sternly push their way through the northern winter-packs; <br>Others descend or ascend the Obi or the Lena; <br>Others the Niger, or the Congo-others the Indus, the Burampooter and Cambodia; <br>Others wait at the wharves of Manhattan, steam'd up, ready to start; <br>Wait, swift and swarthy, in the ports of Australia; <br>Wait at Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin, Marseilles, Lisbon, Naples, <br>Hamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, the Hague, Copenhagen; <br>Wait at Valparaiso, Rio Janeiro, Panama; <br>Wait at their moorings at Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, <br>Charleston, New Orleans, Galveston, San Francisco.\u2019</p><p>In ages when the science of geography was in its earliest dawn\u2014when not one man in ten thousand had heard of towns or rivers beyond the frontiers of his own province\u2014a catalogue of names and countries might be what only a pre-eminently well-informed poet could give, and what every intelligent listener would appreciate and admire. Many interests, besides those of geographical curiosity, interests of a patriotic and clannish nature, enhanced the eager fascination with which the old Greeks heard the names of the nations that sent ships to Troy, or of the ports at which Jason or Ulysses touched. But any boy or girl of twelve, who can spell names of places on a map and write them down on a page, could fill a volume with such descriptive lines as these of Whitman's. Observe, there is no concatenation, no ordered sequence, no quickening or illuminating thought, in the list. The conception of a coherent and reasoned account of the water-ways of the world, on the principle either of their historical development or their commercial or political importance, is beyond him. Nothing could be more void of significance than his throwing together the Wash and the Frith of Solway instead of the Thames, the Severn, the Mersey, or the Clyde, by way of indicating the marine activity of Britain. There is no cause why Bristol and London should not be named as well as Glasgow and Liverpool. The thing, in fact, could not be done more brainlessly. A poor piece of mannerism at best, it is here wretchedly worked, and though Whitman sometimes executes it with less dulness, this is a fair average sample of his success. When we consider that nine-tenths of Whitman's poetry consists of these catalogues\u2014that they, in fact, constitute, in respect both of manner and of matter, one of the differentiating elements in his work\u2014it will be seen that no small importance attaches to the facility of the artifice. It is, in fact, the most childishly easy of all artifices. Think of the materials afforded for such compilation in these days. Every town contains a library in which there are dictionaries of classical antiquity, translations from foreign languages, travellers' volumes on every country under the sun. Every daily newspaper contains correspondence filled with the most picturesque and exciting details the correspondent can rake together. There is absolutely nothing in Whitman's lists that you could not match after a few hours' turning over of the leaves of Lemprierre, Livingstone, Du Chaillu, Figuier, or a few volumes of any one of fifty encyclop\u00e6dias. The world could, on these terms, be filled with poetry, if it were not an absurdity to apply the name to rant and rubbish. Having got at his secret, you soon learn to take stock of the American bard. Almost anything will do to start him off in his jingle, as all roads will suit if you don't want to go anywhere in particular, but merely to raise a dust. Take, for example, the glorious burst of noise which breaks from the minstrel when he mentions the broad-axe.</p><p>\u2018The axe leaps! <br>The solid forest gives fluid utterances; <br>They tumble forth, they rise and form, <br>Hut, tent, landing, survey, <br>Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade, <br>Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, jamb, lath, panel, gable, <br>Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibition-house, library, <br>Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, turret, porch, <br>Hoe, rake, pitchfork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw, jack-plane, mallet, wedge, rounce, <br>Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor, <br>Work-box, chest, string'd instrument, boat, frame, and what not.\u2019 </p><p>What not, indeed? There is no assignable reason why everything else that ever was made of wood might not be added. But why, it is relevant to ask, give these? Ought expression to have no relation to sense? Ought words to have no proportion to ideas? Is there any definition of linguistic silliness, of verbiage, of hopelessly bad writing, more just than that which turns upon extension of sound through corresponding extension of meaning? And this is what Mr. W. Rossetti publishes in England with eulogistic preface! This is the kind of thing which we are commanded to receive as the rhythmic utterance of Western democracy, the voice of America! It is pleasing to reflect that, if people like such poetry, they may have plenty of it. Every auctioneer's clerk will be a poet of the new era. Suppose the subject to be \u2018Occupations\u2019-a poetical subject enough. Who does not see how the bard of democracy would begin setting it to music? Here goes:\u2014</p><p>\u2018Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead works, the sugar-house, steam-saws, the grist-mills, <br>and factories; <br>Stone-cutting, shapely trimmings for fa\u00e7ades or window or door-lintels, the mallet, <br>the tooth-chisel, the jib to protect the thumb.\u2019</p><p>Is this not up to Whitman's mark? Is it not the genuine gurgle of the democratic Castalia? Listen:\u2014</p><p>\u2018Leather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting, <br>Distilling, sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking, <br>Electro-plating, electrotyping, stereotyping.\u2019</p><p>The enlightened reader doubtless asks for more; and it is easy to oblige him:\u2014</p><p>\u2018The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-hook, <br>The scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's maul, <br>And the plenteous winter-work of pork-packing.\u2019</p><p>Am I outrageously caricaturing the favourite of Dr. Dowden, Mr. Rossetti, and Mr. Buchanan? Every line, or rather every amorphous agglomeration of broken clauses, is Whitman's own, Page after page of the like will be found flung together in what he calls a \u2018Carol of Occupations.\u2019 Mr. Rossetti expresses majestical pity for us if we have no ear for such music. Time was when Englishmen knew quackery when they saw it.</p><p>It must be evident that, on the terms and by the methods of which we are now able to form some idea, there would be no difficulty in multiplying the number, or expanding the dimensions, of Whitman's works. They are the most flagrant and offensive example ever met with by me of big badness trying to palm itself off as great excellence. Quantity of production is without question one index of power; and it is true not only that the poet who produces a hundred immortal poems is greater than the poet who produces one, but that the hand of the great artist has a sweep and freedom, corresponding to the largeness of scale on which he likes to work. No artist whose characteristic pictures cannot be appreciated without a lens\u2014though he paint, fold for fold, on the limbs of Titania, the woven air of Cashmere\u2014is a great artist. But it is equally true, and it is much more apt to be forgotten, that, throughout nature as known to man, the transition from inorganic to organic, and from ruder forms to finer forms, is from largeness to smallness. A bird is a more exquisite piece of nature's workmanship than a megalosaurus. And if amount of work is one measure of greatness, there is perhaps no test of the quality of genius so sure as capacity to excel within narrow limits. A weak artist may mask his weakness by showing us enormous limbs a-sprawl on ceilings, but only a consummate artist will conceive and execute a faultless vignette. You might suspect sham work, random smudging and brush-fighting, in Turner's great storms, or billowy plains, or crowding hills, or scarlet and golden sunsets; but you learn to trust them when the same hand traces for you the shadows, and touches for you the rose-buds, in that garden arbour which forms one of the minor illustrations to Roger's poems, or when it works into a few square inches, with tiny flower-pots in fairy-like rows, and gem-like burnishing of flower-petals, a perfect picture of the conservatory at Farnley. All art which is great in quality as well in quantity presupposes such work as we have in Turner's drawing of Farnley conservatory. Turner could not have given the misty curve of his horizons, the perspective of his rivers winding in the distance, unless he had gone through such work as is attested in the minute drawing; and if you take any ten pages in Carlyle's greatest books, in his \u2018French Revolution,\u2019 or his \u2018Cromwell,\u2019 and examine them by reference to the sources, you will find that, broad and bold as is his touch, magnificently free as is his sweep of hand, he has been as strenuously careful in the preliminary mastery of details as was Turner in conning the grammar of his art. Magnitude without worth, breadth of scale without fineness of execution, is the refuge of aspiring and immodest incompetence both in painting and in literature. </p><p>But we must devote more particular attention to what Whitman's admirers have to say in his favour. We are met at the outset by the circumstance that they make admissions for a disparaging nature, such as no critical advocates ever made on behalf of their client. They enable me, to my extreme satisfaction, to refer judge and jury to them on certain points which it would otherwise have been impossible for me to make an English artist understand. Quotation of much that is most characteristic in Whitman's writings is out of the question, and I am not equal to the task of making description do the work of sample. \u2018If there be any class of subjects,\u2019 says Professor Dowden, \u2018which it is more truly natural, more truly human not to speak of, than to speak of (such speech producing self-consciousness, whereas part of our nature, it may be maintained, is healthy only while it lives and moves in holy blindness and unconsciousness of self), if there be any sphere of silence, then Whitman has been guilty of invading that sphere of silence.\u2019 This is a felicitously correct account of what Whitman has done; and most readers will, I think, agree with me that it is a grave offence, an abominable blunder. The man who does not know what to speak of, and what not to speak of, is unfit for society; and if he puts into his books what even he would not dare to say in society, his books cannot be fit for circulation. As Dr. Dowden has defined for us the nature, he will also kindly tell us the extent, of Whitman's offence against civilized manners. \u2018Whitman,\u2019 says Dr. Dowden, \u2018in a few passages falls below humanity\u2014falls even below the modest of brutes.\u2019 This is strictly true; and would, I submit, be enough to sink a ship-load of poems with ten times the merits of Whitman's; and although I shall not say that he often falls below the modesty of brutes, I do say that, not in a few but in many passages, he is senselessly foul. But \u2018it ought not,\u2019 pleads Professor Dowden, \u2018to be forgotten that no one asserts more strenuously than does Whitman the beauty, not indeed of asceticism, but of holiness and healthiness, and the shameful ugliness of unclean thought, desire, and deed.\u2019 If such was his theory, the less pardonable would be his practice; but the truth\u2014to which the critic's generosity seems to blind him\u2014is that Whitman has no fixed theory or settled practice in this or in any other case, but confounds good and bad, delightful and disgusting, decent and indecent, in his chaotic extravaganza. He may be foul on one page and condemn himself for being so on another, just as he may say on one page that there can be no man or woman without religion, and on another that it makes him sick to hear people discussing their duty to God. Mr. Rossetti puts in the plea that eminent writers of all ages have sinned in this matter as well as Whitman. He cites no passages, names no authors, and I content myself with affirming generally that his plea cannot be sustained. There is no author of reputation of whom Dr. Dowden could say that he sinks in immodesty below the brutes. And there is no author whatever who, like Whitman, is indecent from mere extravagance and affectation. They all gives us something to redeem what, nevertheless are blots on their work. Chaucer is gross, but he has humour; Fielding, but he has wit; Whitman has no fun in him. Homer is never gross: he has a vehement sympathy with all natural joy, and there is no monastic coldness in his description of the embrace of Jupiter and Juno, or of the ivory bed of Ulysses; but he is the gentleman always, less than the gentleman never; and his heroes, though they may kill mutton, never infringe that first law of good manners which we have heard Dr. Dowden define. Had Whitman ventured upon the hundredth part of his grossness in the camp of the Greeks, he would have been cudgeled more cordially than Thersites. </p><p>On the intellectual side, Whitman's critics make admissions which are almost as strange as that which certifies his occasional descent, in moral respects, below the level of the brutes. Dr. Dowden speaks of the \u2018recurring tendency of his poems to become catalogues of persons and things.\u2019 It is curious, by the way, that our bard's panegyrists cannot speak of him without using language that sounds like irony. \u2018Selection,\u2019 says Professor Dowden, \u2018seems forbidden to him; if he names one race of mankind, the names of all the other races press into his page; if he mentions one trade or occupation, all other trades or occupations follow.\u2019 Exactly; but it used to be understood that the poet was bound not only to apply the process of selection, but of selection so searching and so keen that, like dross and slag from metal placed in a furnace heated sevenfold, every imperfection was purged away from it, and only the fine stream of liquid gold flowed out. \u2018Writing down the headings of a trades directory,\u2019 says Dr. Dowden again, \u2018is not poetry.\u2019 No. \u2018But this,\u2019 he adds, \u2018is what Whitman never does.\u2019 I respectfully insist that it is a literal description of what Whitman, on Dr. Dowden's own showing, frequently does; but Professor Dowden must admit, at least, that there are no other compositions passing current as poetry of which he would have thought it necessary to make the remark. He states that \u2018the logical faculty is almost an offence to Whitman,\u2019 and owns to suspecting that his matter belongs at times rather to chaos than to cosmos, and that his form corresponds to his matter. But of all the concessions made by Whitman's eulogists, one tendered by Mr. Rossetti pleases me most. \u2018Each of Whitman's poems is,\u2019 he says, \u2018a menstruum saturated with form in solution.\u2019 To this I explicitly subscribe; when the solution crystallizes, it will be time to inquire whether the crystals are poetry. A marble statue in a state of solution is mud. </p><p> We find, then, that the gentlemen who propose to assign Whitman's writings a place of honour in the literature of the world admit that logic is an offence to him, that his matter is occasionally chaotic, that the form of his poems is \u2018form in solution,\u2019 and that his immodesty passes the immodesty of brutes. Having reached this point, might we not expect to be told that the right thing to do with his productions is to cast them away, accepting, with philosophical resignation, the implied suggestion as to their treatment made by the poet himself, in the most reasonable of all his prophecies?\u2014 </p><p>\u2018I bequeath myself to the dirt . . . . . . <br>If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.\u2019</p><p>But Whitman's admirers, of course, refuse to take the hint, and we are bound to give them audience when they attempt to prove that the unparalleled concessions they have made as to his defects are more than balanced by his merits. The main ground on which they commend Whitman is, that he has at last founded a distinctively American school of poetry. The new world, argues Dr. Dowden, may be expected to give birth to \u2018literary and artistic forms corresponding to itself in strange novelty,\u2019 to \u2018a fauna and flora other than the European,\u2019 requiring a new nomenclature, like other American things\u2014\u2019hickory,\u2019 for example, and \u2018mocking-bird.\u2019 American democracy being a great, new, unexampled thing, with faults enough, but yet deserving recognition and respect, the poet of American democracy may, in like manner, though his works are surprising and questionable, deserve applause. Whitman himself sets out, as was mentioned, with a determination to write differently from his contemporaries and predecessors. The American poetry which he found existing was, he intimated, \u2018either the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism\u2014at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, or more or less musical verbiage, arising out of a life of depression and enervation as their result\u2014or else that class of poetry, plays, c., of which the foundation is feudalism, with its ideas of lords and ladies, its imported standards of gentility, and the manners of European high-life-below-stairs in every line and verse.\u2019 \u2018I am the poet of America,\u2019 virtually says the modest Whitman; and our English critics bow assent.</p><p>When we reflect that, among the American poets thus slightingly waived aside, were, to mention no others, Longfellow, Bryant, Emerson, Lowell, and Edgar Poe, the justice of the remark that Whitman shows effrontery will be apparent. But his feeling, as affected by the abundance, apart from all question as to the excellence, of existing poetry, when he first thought of becoming himself a poet, was not unreasonable. It arose from a more or less vague but substantially just perception of the fact that literature is old, that the libraries of the world are well stocked, that subjects, motives, images, incidents, plots, which were novel some thousands of years ago, have become stale. The first broad aspects, the salient facts and features, of that nature which man seeks to present again\u2014represent\u2014in his art, have long since been seized. The interest of dart-throwing and of heroic skull-cleaving was pretty well exhausted by Homer. Goethe says that if Shakespeare had written in German, he (Goethe) would have, at the outset of his literary career, have been oppressed with something like despair; and the years which have passed since Goethe experienced this feeling, with their Scott poetry, their Bryon poetry, their Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Campbell, Tennyson poetry, not to mention half a dozen American poets whose names are known throughout Europe, have incalculably enhanced the difficulty and hazard that face one who, using the English language, aspires to the fame of a poet. Under such circumstances, the temptation to false originality, to one or other forms of affectation, is almost irresistible. I am deliberately of opinion that no young poet or painter,\u2014for what has been said applies mutatis mutandis, to pictorial as well as to literary art,\u2014be his powers what they may, wholly escapes its influence. It causes men of undoubted genius to say things with a queerness, a quaintness, which I, at least, cannot conceive to be natural to them. Mr. Morris, for example, thus describes an occurrence which, though interesting and delightful, has for many ages been a poetical commonplace:\u2014</p><p>\u2018In that garden fair<br>Came Lancelot walking; this is true, the kiss<br>Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day, <br>I scarce dare talk of the remembered bliss, <br>When both our mouths went wandering in one way; <br>And, aching sorely, met among the leaves, <br>Our hands being left behind strained far away.\u2019 </p><p>To say that Lancelot and Guinevere kissed each other would have certainly been ordinary, and Mr. Morris's way of stating the fact is original; but since it is not possible that the kiss could have been performed as he describes it\u2014for although the lovers might have restrained their natural impulse to embrace as well as to kiss, and might have kept their hands before them or at their sides, it is inconceivable that they should have poked their hands out behind them while craning their necks forward to bring their lips together\u2014we must conclude that Mr. Morris considered it a less evil to be fantastic than to be commonplace. Mr. D.G. Rossetti has written several poems which seem to me imperishably great; but he also has suffered from the tyrannical necessity of being original, after nature has been laid under contribution by poets for thousands of years. It would have been as commonplace for Mr. Rossetti to say that he sat musing on the grass, as for Mr. Morris to say that Lancelot took Guinevere into his arms and kissed her. Accordingly Mr. Rossetti writes thus:\u2014</p><p>\u2018The wind flapped loose, the wind was still, <br>Shaken out dead from tree and hill: <br>I had walked on at the wind's will,\u2014 <br>I sat now, for the wind was still.</p><p>\u2018Between my knees my forehead was,\u2014 <br>My lips, drawn in, said not, Alas! <br>My hair was over in the grass, <br>My naked ears heard the day pass.\u2019 </p><p>Original, no doubt, but is it not somewhat odd? The posture described is grotesque, and in a room, when attempted by persons making no claim to the character of poet, cannot be achieved; but even on a peculiarly formed bank in the country, it would be uncomfortable. The feat performed by Mr. Rossetti might be recommended to professors of gymnastics, and, perhaps, if one sat with his head between his knees and his hair in the grass for an hour, the acoustic nerve would become so sensitive through torture that he could \u2018hear the day pass;\u2019 but it is not easy to believe that the lines would have been as they are, [if] Mr. Rossetti had felt it admissible to say so commonplace a thing as that he sat on a green bank and meditated. From the works of Mr. Browning, and even from those of Mr. Tennyson, illustration might be derived of the shuddering horror with which modern poets avoid commonplace; and the oddities and eccentricities of painters during the present century have been equally conspicuous. I recollect seeing a picture of St. George and the Dragon, by an artist admired by many eloquent young ladies, in which the dragon looked like a large green lizard, and St. George like a medical gentleman administering to it, by means of a long glass bottle which he poked into its mouth, a dose of castor-oil. I was given to understand the piece had a profound spiritual significance, but I had not soul enough to comprehend it. </p><p>If the necessity of being original lies hard upon poets in these days, is it not all the more, on that account, the duty of critics to press upon them the equally inexorable necessity of resisting the fascinations of false and affected originality? Novelty is essential to art; every genuine art-product, in sculpture, in painting, in poetry, is unique: but it is intensely untrue that everything that is novel and unparalleled is art; and so easy is it to ape or to travesty right newness, that Whitman's conscious and trumpeted purpose to produce something original ought to have been, in the eyes of critics so acute as Dr. Dowden and so accomplished as Mr. W. Rossetti, a presumption that the originality forthcoming would be spurious. Every art-product is new, but every art-product is also old; and the operation of producing a true poem or picture\u2014an operation too subtle to be described in words or executed by rule\u2014consists essentially in combining newness of form and colour and musical harmony with oldness of principle and law. An illustration of this union, applicable, to my thinking, with scientific accuracy to the case in hand, is afforded by nature every spring. When the brown hill-side breaks, as Goethe finely says, into a wave of green, every hollow of blue shade, every curve of tuft, and plume, and tendril, every broken sun-gleam on spray of young leaves, is new. No spring is a repetition of any former spring. And yet the laws of chemistry and of vegetable life are unchanging. The novelty that the poet must give us is the novelty of spring; and the transcendent but inevitable difficulty of poetical originality lies in this, that the limits of variation within which he is permitted to work are narrow. His poetry must be as different from that of any other poet as one spring is different from another; but it must not be more so. It is a fundamental principle, laid down by that ancient nation which was inspired to write the bible of art, that all gigantesque, eccentric, distorted, extravagant art is barbarous. By working in the spirit of the lesson taught it once and for ever by Greece, Europe has gone beyond Greece; but as far as Europe, in Shakespeare, has transcended Greece, so far will America fall behind and below not Europe only, but Egypt, Babylon, and Assyria, if she casts the lesson of Greece to the winds and consent to the identification of democracy with lawless extravagance. It would, I believe, be unfair to the Americans to speak of them as pledged to admiration of Whitman. They are not afraid to give everyone a hearing, and in this they are bravely right; but they have a way, also, of getting, sooner or later, at the true value of a man, and I rather think they have found Whitman out. I have produced abundant evidence to prove that he exceeds all the bounds fixed to sound poetical originality, and is merely grotesque, and surprising. </p><p> It is instructive to note that, whenever Whitman is, comparatively speaking, rational and felicitous, his writing becomes proportionally like that of other people. Of really good poetical work there is, indeed, in those of his poems known to me\u2014and I have read, with desperate resolution, a great deal both of his prose and his verse, including productions which his eulogists specifically extol\u2014very little. Even his best passages have this characteristic of inferior writing, that they deal with sensational subjects and fierce excitements. His lack of delicate and deep sensibility is proved by his producing horror when he aims at pathos. The true masters of pathos obtain their greatest effects by means that seem slight. A Shakespeare, a Goethe, will make all generations mourn over the sorrows of an Italian girl, of a German grisette; a daisy, a mouse, a wounded hare, evoke touches of immortal pathos from Burns. Whitman must have his scores massacred, his butcherly apparatus of blood and mangled flesh, his extremity of peril in storm, his melodramatic exaggeration of courage in battle. But it is in the few sketches of such scenes, occurring in the poem called \u2018Walt Whitman,\u2019 that he is most successful; and then his affectations fall, to a refreshing extent, from his loins, and he makes some approach to the perspicuity, compression, vividness, and force of good writing in general. If his English critics had contented themselves with discriminating between what is passably good and what is insufferably bad in his work, commending the former and condemning the latter, not a word would have been written by me upon the subject. Dr. Dowden, Mr. Rossetti, Mr. Buchanan, and, most vociferously of all, Mr. Swinburne, accept him at his own valuation as \u2018the greatest of American voices,\u2019\u2020 and the poet of democracy. To do so is to wrong the true poets which America has produced, and to strike a pang as of despair into the hearts of those who, amid all shortcomings and delinquencies, amid Fiske tragedies and Tammany Rings, refuse to believe that democracy means dissolution, and that the consummation of freedom must be an exchange of the genial bonds and decent amenities of civilization for infra-bestial license. Originality, true and clear, characterizes the real poets of America. There is in them a fragrance and flavour native to the American soil, a something that gives them a character as distinctive as marks off the Elizabethans from Milton, or distinguishes Pope and his school from recent English poets. More than this was not to be looked for or desired; the strong presumption was that more than this would indicate monstrosity, debility, or affectation; and this presumption has been verified by Whitman. Nature in America is different from nature in Europe, but we do not, in crossing the Atlantic, pass from cosmos into chaos; and Mr. Carlyle's expression, \u2018winnowings of chaos,\u2019 would be a candidly scientific description of Whitman's poetry if only it were possible to associate with it the idea of any winnowing process whatever. Street-sweepings of lumber-land\u2014disjointed fragments of truth, tossed in wild whirl with disjointed fragments of falsehood\u2014gleams of beauty that have lost their way in a waste of ugliness\u2014such are the contents of what he calls his poems. If here and there we have tints of healthful beauty, and tones of right and manly feeling, they but suffice to prove that he can write sanely and sufferably when he pleases, that his monstrosities and solecisms are sheer affectation, that he is not mad, but only counterfeits madness. He is in no sense a superlatively able man, and it was beyond his powers to make for himself a legitimate poetical reputation. No man of high capacity could be so tumid and tautological as he\u2014could talk, for instance, of the \u2018fluid wet\u2019 of the sea; or speak of the aroma of his armpits, or make the crass and vile mistake of bringing into light what nature veils, and confounding liberty with dissolute anarchy. The poet of democracy he is not; but his books may serve to buoy, for the democracy of America, those shallows and sunken rocks on which, if it is cast, it must inevitably, amid the hootings of mankind, be wrecked. Always, unless he chooses to contradict himself for the sake of paradox, his political doctrine is the consecration of mutinous independence and rabid egotism and impudent conceit. In his ideal city \u2018the men and women think lightly of the laws.\u2019 His advice is to resist much and to obey little. This is the political philosophy of Bedlam, unchained in these ages chiefly through the influence of Rousseau, which has blasted the hopes of freedom wherever it has had the chance, and which must be chained up again with ineffable contempt if the self-government of nations is to mean anything else than the death and putrescence of civilization. Incapable of true poetical originality, Whitman had the cleverness to invent a literary trick and the shrewdness to stick to it. As a Yankee phenomenon, to be good-humouredly laughed at, and to receive that moderate pecuniary remuneration which nature allows to vivacious quacks, he would have been in his place; but when influential critics introduce him to the English public as a great poet, the thing becomes too serious for a joke. While reading Whitman, in the recollection of what had been said about him by those gentlemen, I realized with bitter painfulness how deadly is the peril that our literature may pass into conditions of horrible disease, the raging flame of fever taking the place of natural heat, the ravings of delirium superseding the enthusiasm of poetical imagination, the distortions of tetanic spasm caricaturing the movements, dance-like and music-measured, of harmonious strength. Therefore I suspended more congenial work to pen this little counterblast to literary extravagance and affectation. </p><p> PETER BAYNE. </p>", "date": "December 1875", "year": 1875, "creator": "Peter Bayne", "publication": "The Contemporary Review", "citation": "Bayne, Peter. \"Walt Whitman's Poems.\" December 1875.

When Walt Whitman was welcomed to Olympus a quarter of a century ago, his greatness was as secure as it is today, when he is acknowledged by the people whose greatness inspires his verse. In all quarters of the Union, North, South, East and West, Walt Whitman has the warmest personal friends who, if they have not met him face to face, have felt the grasp of his hand in his words. No other man has expressed his personality so strongly in his poems. One of the best characterizations of 'Leaves of Grass' is that of a lady, who said: 'It does not read like a book; it seems like a man.' The publication of the complete poems of Walt Whitman by one of the leading publishers of the United States is a literary event, for through it the greatest American poet has come to the birthright denied him so long. It has, indeed, mattered little to him, for he has bided his time patiently and serenely, and when such captains of the mind as Emerson and Tennyson reached out their hands in friendly recognition, he could rest satisfied that the multitude would some day acknowledge the prophet hailed by those leaders. The date of the following lines seem remote enough:</p><p>CONCORD, Mass., July. 1855.</p><p>Dear Sir: I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of the 'Leaves of Grass.' I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork or too much lymph in the temperament were making our western wits fat and mean. I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a stint. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion, but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging. I did not know, until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper, that I could trust the name as real and available for the postoffice. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.</p><p>R. W. Emerson.</p><p>Though these words were afterward somewhat taken back\u2014a little Galileo-like, through fear of the New England pope called prudery\u2014it was the true Emerson who spoke his heart then. 'Leaves of Grass' have been harvested several times and bound in sheaves of various form, from the quaint first edition, which was both body and soul, the work of Walt Whitman, to that of the New York Publisher who was so frightened at what he had done that he</p><p><em>BACKED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE;</em></p><p>that of the Boston publisher, which has been the standard for many years because of the implied demand; the personal edition published by the poet himself; one or more of the English editions, and now at last the edition just published by James R. Osgood & Co., a compact volume of 382 pages, with all the elements of attractive typography, binding form and price needed for the great popular success which the work is sure to achieve. That beside its assured hearty reception the book will be much maligned and ridiculed is a matter of course, for as it is read more so will there be more opposition to its lessons. But it is a test of greatness that ridicule it as much as you will, the ridicule will not stick. Walt Whitman has survived the great storms that have assailed him and his fame is secure from the pattering of little showers.</p><p>The new edition contains all his poems; the only changes that have been made are in the way of condensation of utterance. There are, also, something like 20 new poems printed direct from the manuscript. There is more of a rounding and completeness of the work; the all embracing patriotism which forms one of the poet's grandest characteristics is more comprehensive than ever before manifested. Walt Whitman did yeoman service for the Union in the hospitals of the field during the war, and he loves the whole Union. He has a warm place in his heart for the South, and it is manifested on many pages of this new edition. He writes:</p><p>'I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the <br>wise,<br>Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br>Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<br>Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with <br>stuff that is fine.<br>One of the nation of many nations, the smallest the same <br>and the largest the same,<br>A southerner soon as a northerner.'</p><p>The titles of a number of poems have been changed, notably that of the great poem of the work, that which strikes the key note of the volume, 'Walt Whitman,' being now known as 'Song of Myself.' At the beginning of this song is a portrait of the poet as he was when 'Leaves of Grass' was gestating, a steel engraving from an old daguerreotype taken in 1856 when Walt Whitman was 37 years old. He was then a carpenter, building and selling cottage houses in Brooklyn, and the picture was taken impromptu one warm June afternoon by Gabriel Harrison. The picture is well described by the lines:</p><p>'Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I <br>am,<br>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, <br>unitary,<br>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpa-<br>ble certain rest.<br>Looking with side-curved head curious what will come <br>next.<br>Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering <br>at it.'</p><p><em>THE OLD OBJECTIONS</em></p><p>will, of course, be brought up. Many will say they agree with the ideas, but what is the use of printing them in the shape of poetry? Because it reads better that way, and it is poetry of the noblest kind, may be answered. Why is it that so many still insist that conventional form is necessary to poetry? Do they admire flowers most, or the vase? In Milton's day many maintained that 'Paradise Lost' was not a poem because it was not in rhyme. In the 'Leaves of Grass' the blades are of unequal length, but they are ever fresh and beautiful, and full of sweet nutriment. Thought, and truth, and strength, and nobility, and grand proportions, whose symmetry belittles inequalities of metre, are all there, and rhythmic swing is there. Is anything more needed for poetry?</p><p>One of the great features of Walt Whitman is that he does not seek his ideals in far away times, which stripped of their glamour of, remoteness, are but as the times of today; or, in supreme moments, he idealizes the commonplace, and has the clearness of vision that discerns the gleam of gold through all the accumulated dross.</p><p>The large and the magnificent tolerance that includes all and allows for all, and finds a place for all, is a sublime characteristic of the man. There is so much in these lines that they cannot be packed into layers of equal length. The book teems with the ecstasy of being. The statement of details into which the poet now and then drops has been criticised as 'cataloging.' But viewed with the poet's intention, what a mosaic picture of the people, of the nation and its races, is thus constituted! One sees the stir and hears the hum of the entire land; feels the pulse of the multitude. What is the use of attempting to depict such a thing\u2014it can't be all shown. But the effect is like a gleam of sunshine in the depths of a forest; it reveals many things with vivid distinctness; there is a vast reserve of hidden things which might be seen, but enough is shown to tell what is there\u2014to give the character of the place. Do not these fragments, picked from different parts of the country, at random, give an idea of what the life of that country is:</p><p>'The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the <br>wharf or levee,<br>As the wooly-pates hoe in the sugar field, the over-<br>seer views them from his saddle.<br>The bugle calls in the bedroom, the gentlemen run for <br>their partners, the dancers bow to each other.<br>The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and <br>harks to the musical rain,<br>The wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill <br>the Huron.<br>The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth, is offer-<br>ing mocassin and bead bars for sale,<br>The connoisseur peers along the exhibition gallery, <br>with half-shut eyes bent sideways.'</p><p><em>THE WANT OF ARTISTIC GRACE</em></p><p>in form is compensated for by the artistic picturesqueness of form; in a measure, the poet makes pictures of his poems, and thus strengthens their individuality. For instance, the frequent use of italics and parentheses and the choice of odd words now and then\u2014a bit of Spanish or French. Camerado and Libertad are favorites. These foreign words and phrases seem to depict unassimilated fragments floating on the life-current of the nation.</p><p>Many intelligent people fail to comprehend; they can't see what the poet is driving at\u2014it is all so strange and unwanted, or unlike previous models. They get too close to the canvass; they see nothing but paint and brush marks; they do not take it all in\u2014they do not see the picture. What a daring use of color! Only a strong man could wield such a brush. Should a weaker man attempt such bold figures; he would make himself ridiculous; it would seem like affectation, as it would should he wear unconventional dress. But Walt Whitman can carry it off. He looks exceeding well in his broad hat, wide collar and suit of modest gray. We all want more freedom of movement, but he can afford to take it and is not afraid. Read this vivid description of a sunrise:</p><p>'To behold the day-break!<br>The little light fades the immense and diaphanous <br>shadows.<br>The air tastes good to my palate.<br>Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently <br>rising freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.<br>Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous <br>prongs,<br>Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.'</p><p>And this from one of the many pictures of death:</p><p>'And as to you, corpse, I think you are good manure, <br>but that does not offend me.<br>I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing.<br>I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts<br> of melons.'</p><p>There is much that will not be understood by many, much to which many will object, but as willing guests who approach a beautifully spread table, upon which are dishes which some like and dislike, and others again can learn to like\u2014there is enough of grandeur and beauty and truth, so that every body can</p><p><em>TAKE AWAY SOMETHING TO HIS TASTE.</em></p><p>The poems are not to be accepted too literally, and the poet understood to be doing or wishing to do everything which is spoken of under the cover of the first person\u2014he simply expresses his capacity to feel universally; he impersonates all humanity in himself, puts himself in its place, and surveys the universe from his standpoint\u2014as everyone is to himself the central point of the world.</p><p>'I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the <br>time while I wait for a boat,<br>(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the <br>tongue of you,<br>Tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosen'd).'</p><p>Walt Whitman is the poet of evolution\u2014modern science finds its prophet in him. He conjoins materialism with ideality. He is religious in the largest sense.</p><p>'Each is not for its own sake,<br>I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are <br>for religion's sake.</p><p>I say no man has ever been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, <br>and how certain the future is.'</p><p>The course of the 'Song of Myself' is like that of a noble drama, and it has the sublimest moments in its culmination. How sound physical health asserts itself here:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they are<br>so placid and self-contain'd,<br>I stand and look at them long and long.</p><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their <br>sins.<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to <br>God,<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the <br>mania of owning things.<br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived <br>thousands of years ago.<br>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole <br>earth.'</p><p>What an omnisciently inspired and sustained note in the passages beginning with the following:</p><p>'I heard what was said of the universe,<br>I heard it and heard it of several thousand years;<br>It is middling well as far as it goes\u2014but is that all!</p><p>Magnifying and applying come I,<br>Outbidding at the start the old cautions hucksters,<br>Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,<br>Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his <br>grandson.<br>Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,<br>In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf,<br> the crucifix engraved.<br>With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every <br>idol and image,<br>Taking them all for what they are worth and not a <br>cent more.'</p><p>'I do not despise you priest, all time, the world over,<br>My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of <br>faiths.<br>Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between <br>ancient and modern.'</p><p>'Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like <br>cheerful boatmen.<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings.<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.<br>Before I was born out of my mother generations <br>guided me.<br>My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could <br>overlay it.<br>For it the nebula cohered to an orb,<br>The long, slow strata piled to rest it on.<br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance.<br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and <br>deposited it with care.</p><p>All forces have been steadily employed to complete <br>and delight me,<br>Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.'</p><p><em>WAS EVER THE COURSE OF CREATION</em></p><p>more concisely and grandly stated? Does it not make old fables turn pale? It is a lofty height from which all this is said down to the world. Taking the national side of the poet, were the local names ever more truthfully or poetically expressed than in the following:</p><p>'The red aborigines,<br>Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, <br>calls as of birds and animals in the woods, syllabled to us <br>for names.<br>Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez,<br> Chattahoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,<br>Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla- <br>Walla.<br>Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, <br>charging the water and the land with names.'</p><p>It is interesting to note some of the favorite passages of the poet's most eminent admirers. The lines previously quoted, 'I heard what was said of the universe,' are especially admired by J. T. Trowbridge, who knows them by heart. The favorite passage of the late Prof. Clifford, the Englishman, who was one of the first to introduce the poet to transatlantic audiences were the glowing lines to night:</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing<br> night,<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.<br>Press close bare-bosom'd night\u2014press close magnetic <br>nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds\u2014night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night\u2014mad naked summer night.</p><p>Smile, O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset\u2014earth of the mountains<br>misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer <br>for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbow'd earth\u2014rich apple-blossom'd <br>earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.</p><p>Prodigal you have given me love\u2014therefore, I to you <br>give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love.'</p><p>The favorite poem of Charles Sumner was the first one under the head of 'Sea Drift,' the idyl of sunny loveliness, called 'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.' The poem is too long to quote here, but here is one of its lyrics, the song of two mated birds, 'Two Feathered Guests from Alabama':</p><p>Shine! shine! shine!<br>Pour down your warmth great sun!<br>While we bask, we two together.</p><p>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north.<br>Day come white, or night come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,<br>Singing all time, minding all time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Of the poems here collected for the first time that written in Platte canon, Colorado, amid its awful ruggedness and grandeur, is a magnificent justification of the poet's methods:</p><p>Spirit that form'd this scene,<br>These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked <br>freshness.<br>These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,<br>I know thee, savage spirit\u2014we have communed to-<br>gether.<br>Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own.<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten <br>art?<br>To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delica <br>tesse?<br>The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's <br>grace\u2014column and polish'd arch forgot?<br>But thou that revelest here\u2014spirit that form'd this <br>scene,<br>They have remember'd thee.</p><p><em>IN 'ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA'</em></p><p>a charming picture is given of the effect of music on a quiet evening at a solitary frontier post.

Grant, returned from his world's tour, he says that what best he sees in him is not the tribute paid to him, but that in his walks with kings the prairie sovereigns of the West, 'Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world's promenade, were all so justified.' Others of these new poems, full of beauty, are 'Thou orb aloft full dazzling' (which was rejected by a leading editor last summer, on the ground that his readers would not understand it), 'To the Man-of-War Bird,' 'Patrolling Barnegat,' 'My Picture Gallery,' 'The Prairie States,' a tribute to Custer's memory called 'From far Dakota's canons,' 'A Riddle Song,' inspired by the mystery of life, and the following tender, reverential lines to his mother's memory:</p><p><em>AS AT THY PORTALS ALSO, DEATH.</em></p><p>As at thy portals also, death.<br>Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds.<br>To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, <br>maternity,<br>To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from <br>me,<br>(I see again the calm benignant face, fresh and <br>beautiful still,<br>I sit by the form in the coffin.<br>I kiss, and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips,<br> the cheeks, the closed eyes in the coffin).<br>To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of<br> earth, life, love, to me the best,<br>I grave a monumental line before I go, amid these songs,<br>And set a tombstone here.</p><p>Face to face with lines which approach the grave with such classic nobility of step, who can say that Walt Whitman is not a poet? A thoughtful writer of German birth and education, but living today in America, has said that some of the main features and themes of 'Leaves of Grass' may be designated as individuality, inevitable law, physical health, modernness, open air nature, democracy, comradeship, the indissoluble union, good will to other lands, respect to the past, grandeur of labor, perfect state equality, with modernness like a canopy over all, and a resumption of the old Greek ideas of nudity and the divinity of the body, with the Hebrew sacredness of paternity, while the war, the sea, the night, the south and poems of death are also frequently recurring themes. His treatment of the last mentioned theme is specially notable in the 'Memories of President Lincoln.' In the stately elegy which begins these memories, 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed,' the threading of the theme shows a high dramatic instinct. As the singer walks the night with the knowledge of death and the thought of death as companions, the warble of the gray-brown bird singing in the swamp the song of death pervades it all. The notes recur like the motive of a symphony, and at last</p><p><em>THE SONG BREAKS FORTH:</em></p><p>Come lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriv-<br>ing,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate death.<br>Prais'd be the fathomless universe.<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curi-<br>ous,<br>And for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.<br>Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, <br>come unfalteringly.</p><p>The foregoing lines are but a part of the bird song. Another song on the death of Lincoln, 'Oh Captain! My Captain!' is already established as a popular American classic.</p><p>The poet Stedman, in a recent article, used the unfortunate expression that his appreciative criticism on 'Walt Whitman,' printed in Scribner's some months ago, was churlishly received. The writer chances to know that Mr. Stedman has somehow sadly misapprehended the state of the case. Mr. Whitman has the warmest personal regard for Mr. Stedman, of whom he speaks with a genuine liking, and he felt the real worth of Mr. Stedman's article, but he also felt that Mr. Stedman had failed to grasp the wholeness of the work, though no finer characterization of the parts could be found. 'Leaves of Grass' is a kosmos, and the leaving out of that which Mr. Stedman, in common with many, finds objectionable, would make it like an imperfect body. One of the greatest of living authors, in speaking with the writer about that passage in Mr. Stedman's article, where it was stated that nature always covered up her bare and ugly spots, and that, therefore, such did not belong in the field of poetry, said that there were times when nature was bare and ugly, that it was the province of art to be truthful to nature, and that genius could treat these themes without offence. In all Walt Whitman there is no more evil thought than in the sprouting of a bud or the wafting of pollen on the wings of springtime. Fortunately it is based upon a law more stable than the fickle suffrages of the multitude, or the wishes of those who would have had him write differently, and, therefore, but partially true.</p>", "date": "October 30 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "Walt Whitman and Sylvester Baxter", "publication": "The Sunday Herald", "citation": "Whitman, Walt, and Sylvester Baxter [unsigned in original]. \"Leaves of Grass.\" 30 October 1881.

Osgood & Co. of this city. Mr. Whitman, though now nearly 68 years of age, is still hale and vigorous, both in body and mind. The shock of paralysis which he sometime ago experienced still causes him some inconvenience, but does not prevent his moving about, and his striking face and imposing figure, in its somewhat odd dress, has become quite familiar to people of the West End, where he has resided. All who came in contact with the venerable poet were charmed by his cheery kindness, his wit and humor and his intelligent conversation. He has by no means ceased to write, and during the last two or three weeks of his stay in Boston produced several new pieces, which will appear for the first time in the new edition of his poems. Mr. Whitman is eminently the poet of passing events. He does not seek for a grand subject for his muse, but being of a poetic nature he sees the poetry that exists in events almost commonplace. They suggest a poetic thought, and he gives it expression in his own peculiar style. In fact, the most of his short poems are but the expression of a single thought. As an illustration of Mr. Whitman's grasping an idea, may be instanced his poem, entitled, 'The Sobbing of the Bells,' first published in the POST. Mr. Whitman was awakened by the tolling of the bells announcing the death of President Garfield. He appreciated the pathos of the event, and rising, wrote the few lines which so beautifully expressed the sentiment, and which have already become famous. Mr. Whitman's poems have been severely criticized, but much of the criticism is due to a failure to understand. Whether his peculiar style of expression is to be commended or not may be a question, but the beauty of the thoughts expressed cannot be denied. Among the new poems to appear in the volume we take the privilege of quoting a few. The following lines, suggested by hearing a regimental band in the wilds of the far west, is another illustration of Mr. Whitman's ability to see the poetry of ordinary events:</p><p><em>ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA.</em></p><p>['The Seventeenth\u2014the finest Regimental band I<br> ever heard.']<br>Through the soft evening air enwinding all,<br>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless <br>wilds,<br>In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,<br>Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,<br>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meaning unknown <br>before.<br>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here,<br>related here,<br>Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience<br>of the opera house.<br>Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at<br>home,<br>Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's an-<br>guish,<br>And thy ecstatic chorus Pelinto;)<br>Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br>Music, Italian music in Dakota.</p><p>While nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,<br>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br>Acknowledging rapport however far remove'd,<br>(As some old root or soul of earth its last-born <br>flower or fruit),<br>Listens well pleas'd.</p><p>Another, a bit of description, is in a style well adapted to the grand scene described.</p><p><em>SPIRIT THAT FORM'D THIS SCENE.</em></p><p>[Written in Platte Canon, Colorado.]<br>Spirit that form'd this scene,<br>These tumbled rock piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent clear streams, this naked<br>freshness.<br>These tormices wild arrays, for reasons of their own,<br>I know thee, savage spirit\u2014we have communed to-<br>gether,<br>Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten <br>art?<br>To fuse within themselves its rules precise and deli-<br>catesse?<br>The lyrist's measure'd beat, the wrought out temple's <br>grace\u2014columns and plish'd arch forgot?<br>but thou that revelest here\u2014spirit that form'd this<br>scene,<br>They have remember'd thee.</p><p>In four lines Mr. Whitman catches a thought that embalms philosophy in poetry. It is this:</p><p><em>ROAMING IN THOUGHT.</em></p><p>[After reading Hegel.]<br>Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the <br>little that is good steadily hastening towards <br>immortality,<br>And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening <br>to merge itself and become lost and dead.</p><p>Two other poems of exceptional merit and both new, we quote: The first is:</p><p><em>THE DALLIANCE OF THE EAGLES.</em></p><p>Skirting the river road, (my forenoon walk, my <br>rest,)<br>Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance <br>of the eagles,<br>The rushing amorous contact high in space together,<br>The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, <br>gyrating wheel,<br>Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass <br>tight grappling,<br>In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight down-<br>ward falling,<br>Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a mo-<br>ment's lull,<br>A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, <br>talons loosening,<br>Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their <br>separate diverse flight,<br>She hers, he his, pursuing.</p><p>The second like the one previously quoted is inspired by bird life, and its force is apparent:</p><p><em>TO THE MAN-OF-WAR BIRD.</em></p><p>Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm,<br>Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions.<br>(Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,<br>And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee),<br>Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating.<br>As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,<br>(Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating <br>vast)</p><p>Far, far at sea,<br>After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shore <br>with wrecks,<br>With reappearing day as now so happy and serene,<br>The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,<br>The limpid spread of air cerulean,<br>Thou also reappearest.<br>Thou born to match the gale (thou art all wings)<br>To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurri-<br>cane,<br>Thou ship of air that never furl's thy sails,<br>Days, even weeks untired and onward, through <br>spaces, realms gyrating.<br>At dusk that look'st on Senegal, at morn America,<br>That sport'st amid the lightning flash and thunder <br>cloud,<br>In them, in thy experiences, had'st thou my soul,<br>What joys! what joys were thine!</p><p>Mr. Whitman still braves the criticism adverse to certain passages of his poems which has been made.

The two volumes called Leaves of Grass and the Two Rivulets, which he had printed and himself sold at Camden, N. J., are now issued in one, under the former title, without special accretions of new work, but not without a good deal of re-arrangement in the sequence of the poems. Pieces that were evidently written later, and intended to be eventually put under Leaves of Grass now find their place; some that apparently did well enough where they were have been shifted to other departments. On the whole, however, the changes have been in the direction of greater clearness as regards their relation to the sub-titles. It is not apparent, however, that the new book is greatly superior to the old in typography, although undeniably the fault of the privately printed volumes, a variation in types used, is no longer met with. The margins are narrower, and the look of the page more commonplace. The famous poem called 'Walt Whitman' is now the 'Song of Myself.' It still maintains:</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>It still has the portrait of Whitman when younger, standing in a loose flannel shirt and slouched hat, with one hand on his hip, the other in his pocket. 'Eidolons' has been taken from the second volume and placed, for good reasons that the reader may not be ready to understand, among the first pieces gathered under the sub-title 'Inscriptions.' It ends with the 'Songs of Parting,' under which the last is 'So Long,' a title that a foreigner and perhaps many an American might easily consider quite as untranslatable as Mr. Whitman proclaims himself to be. The motive for the publication seems to be to take advantage of that wider popularity which is coming somewhat late in life to him whom his admirers like to call 'the good gray poet.'</p><p>One great anomaly of Whitman's case has been that while he is an aggressive champion of democracy and of the working-man, in a broad sense of the term working-man, his admirers have been almost exclusively of a class the farthest possibly removed from that which labors for daily bread by manual work. Whitman has always been truly caviare to the multitude. It was only those that knew much of poetry and loved it greatly who penetrated the singular shell of his verses and rejoiced in the rich, pulpy kernel. Even with connoisseurs, Whitman has been somewhat of an acquired taste, and it has always been amusing to note the readiness with which persons who would not or could not read him, raised a cry of affectation against those who did. This phenomenon is too well known in other departments of taste to need further remark; but it may be added that Mr. Whitman has both gained by it and lost. He has gained a vigorousness of support on the part of his admirers that probably more than outbalances the acrid attacks of those who consider his work synonymous with all that is vicious in poetical technique, and wicked from the point of morals. As to the latter, it must be confessed that, according to present standards of social relations, the doctrines taught by Whitman might readily be construed, by the overhasty or unscrupulous, into excuses for foul living: for such persons do not look below the surface, nor can they grasp the whole idea of Whitman's treatment of love. However fervid his expressions may be, and however scornful he is of the miserable hypocrisies that fetter but also protect the evilly disposed, it is plain that the idea he has at heart is that universal love which leaves no room for wickedness because it leaves no room for doing or saying unkind, uncharitable, unjust things to his fellow-man. With an exuberance of thought that would supply the mental outfit of ten ordinary poets, and with a rush of words that is by no means reckless, but intensely and grandly labored, Whitman hurls his view of the world at the heads of his readers with a vigor and boldness that takes away one's breath.</p><p>This century is getting noted among centuries for singular departures in art and literature. Among them all, there is none bolder or more original than that of Whitman. Perhaps Poe in his own line might be cited as an equal. It is strange, and yet it is not strange, that he should have waited so long for recognition, and that by many thousands of people of no little culture his claims to being a poet at all are either frankly scouted or else held in abeyance. Literature here has remarkably held aloof from the vital thoughts and hopes of the country. It seems as if the very crudity of the struggle here drove people into a petty dilettante atmosphere of prettiness in art and literature as an escape from the dust and cinders of daily life. Hence our national love for 'slicked up' pictures, for instance, by which it is often claimed in Europe that promising geniuses in painting, there, have been ruined for higher work. Hence our patronage of poets that have all the polish of a cymbal, but all a cymbal's dry note and hollowness. Hence, at one time, our admiration for orators that were ornate to the verge of inanity. Into this hot-house air of literature Walt Whitman bounded, with the vigor and suppleness of a clown at a funeral. Dire were the grimaces of the mourners in high places, and dire are their grimaces still.</p><p>There were plenty of criticisms to make, even after one had finished crying Oh! at the frank sensuality, the unbelievable nakedness of Walt. Everything that decent folk covered up, Walt exhibited, and boasted of exhibiting! He was proud of his nakedness and sensuality. He cried, Look here, you pampered rogues of literature, what are you squirming about, when you know, and everybody knows, that things are just like this, always have been, always will be? But it must be remembered that this was what he wrote, and that he did with a plan, and by order from his genius. It has never been heard of him that he was disgusting in talk or vile in private life, while it has been known that poets celebrated for the lofty tone of their morality, for the strictness of their Christianity, the purity of their cabinet hymns, can condescend in private life to wallow in all that is base. That is the other great anomaly of Whitman. He rhapsodizes of things seldom seen in print with the enthusiasm of a surgeon enamoured of the wonderful mechanism of the body. But he does not soil his conversation with lewdness. If evil is in him, it is in his book.</p><p>Whitman's strength and Whitman's weakness lie in his lack of taste. As a mere external sign, look at his privately printed volumes. For a printer and typesetter, reporter and editor, they do not show taste in the selection and arrangement of the type. A cardinal sin in the eyes of most critics is the use of French, Spanish, and American-Spanish words which are scattered here and there, as if Whitman had picked them up, sometimes slightly incorrectly, from wandering minstrels, Cubans, or fugitives from one of Walker's raids. He shows crudely the American way of incorporating into the language a handy or a high-sounding word without elaborate examination of its original meaning, just as we absorb the different nationalities that crowd over from Europe. His thought and his mode of expression is immense, often flat, very often monotonous, like our great sprawling cities with their endless scattering of suburbs. Yet when one gets the 'hang' of it, there is a colossal grandeur in conception and execution that must finally convince whoever will be patient enough to look for it. His rhythm, so much burlesqued, is all of a part with the man and his ideas. It is apparently confused; really most carefully schemed; certainly to a high degree original. It has what to the present writer is the finest thing in the music of Wagner - a great booming movement or undertone, like the noise of heavy surf. His crowded adjectives are like the medival writers of Irish, those extraordinary poets who sang the old Irish heroes and their own contemporaries, the chiefs of their clans. No Irishman of to-day has written a nobler lament for Ireland, or a more hopeful, or a more truthful, than has Walt Whitman. Yet it is not said that he has Irish blood. Nor is there to be found in our literature another original piece of prose so valuable to future historians as his notes on the war. Nor is there a poet of the war-time extant who has so struck the note of that day of conflict as Whitman has in 'Drum Taps.' He makes the flesh creep. His verses are like the march of the long lines of volunteers, and then again like the bugles of distant cavalry. But these are parts of him. As he stands complete in Leaves of Grass, in spite of all the things that regard for the decencies of drawing-rooms and families may wish away, he certainly represents, as no other writer in the world, the struggling, blundering, sound-hearted, somewhat coarse, but still magnificent vanguard of Western civilization that is encamped in the United States of America. He avoids the cultured few. He wants to represent, and does in his own strange way represent, the lower middle stratum of humanity. But, so far, it is not evident that his chosen constituency cares for, or has even recognized him. Wide readers are beginning to guess his proportions.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Leaves of Grass By Walt Whitman. Boston: James R.

So I view the three men, in the mass of their character,\u2014not considering the loose and trivial details which to many eyes have seemed to be the whole character. It if were possible to see the genius of a great people throwing itself now into this form, now into that,\u2014as the prairie wheat-field takes the quick shape of the passing wind-it would be just to say that we had seen this mystery in the 'plain heroic magnitude of mind' with which [John] Brown met death,\u2014in the broad and patient wisdom of Lincoln,\u2014and in the immense landscape of Whitman's teeming and unharvested imagination. His 'Leaves of Grass,' as he has now published them at Osgood's in Boston, complete the vast picture of his mind and bring out not merely the confusion of details, which we could only see at first, by the light of poetic flashes\u2014but the broad unity of the piece. It is as if the ancient seamen had found their ocean-god slumbering along his shores, and upon near view could only see a hand here, an eyebrow there, a floating mass of beard elsewhere,\u2014but when they stood back from the strand, or best if they climbed a hill of prospect, the symmetry and articulation of the mighty frame plainly appeared, and they knew by sight their unconscious divinity, Neptune. There is in Whitman's verse, more than in any other modern poet's, what Keats called 'that large utterance of the early gods,'-an indistinct grandeur of expression not yet molded to the melody of Shakespeare, Lucretius and \u00c6schylus, but like what Keats again calls 'the overwhelming voice of huge Enceladus':\u2014</p><p>'Whose ponderous syllables, like sullen waves<br>In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rock<br>Came booming thus,'\u2014</p><p>'I announce natural persons to arise,<br>I announce justice triumphant,<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,<br>I announce the justification of candor and the justifi- <br>cation of pride.<br>I announce that the identity of those states is a sin-<br> gle identity only,<br>I announce the Union more and more compact, indis-<br> soluble,<br>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the <br>previous polities of the earth insignificant.'</p><p>It is when he speaks of Lincoln and the civil war that Whitman is least indistinct, and no other of our poets-no nor all of them together-has so well caught and rendered the spirit of that struggle as he has done it. As has been remarked by others no doubt, and more than once, Whitman gives the whole episode of slavery in its relation to the war, in the strange fragment called</p><p><em>ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLORS.</em></p><p>Who are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,With your woolly-white and turbaned head, and bare bony feet?Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?</p><p>'Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,<br>Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to <br>me,<br>As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.</p><p><em>Me, master, years a hundred since from my parents <br>sundered.<br>A little child they caught me as the savage beast <br>is caught,<br>Then hither me across the sea, the cruel slaver <br>brought.</em></p><p>No further does she say, but lingering all day,<br>Her high borne turbaned head she wags, and rolls <br>her darkling eye,<br>And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving <br>by.</p><p>What is it, fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?<br>Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red <br>and green?<br>Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or <br>have seen?</p><p>This new volume of Whitman's contains philosophy, antiquities and history all in one, and is the book of the year in Boston which will bear the most reading and study. The only one to compare with it is another of Osgood's publications, Mr Cooke's 'Ralph Waldo Emerson,'-and the two are curiously related to each other. But for Emerson, Whitman might never have written, or written in another form, and what can be further from the Emersonian mode of writing than these unformed and almost lawless numbers, this broad range over the most prosaic elements of life, as well as those regions of ideal beauty in which the genius of Emerson delights?</p>", "date": "November 10 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Springfield Daily Republican", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman's New Book.\" 10 November 1881.

Osgood & Co. of Boston, in a handsome 382 page volume, price $2. There are about three hundred pieces all composed in the free and capricious measure so peculiar to Whitman (entirely unlike poetry as generally written), and which few people will like at first sight, whatever they may do after studying it well out.</p><p>Mr. Whitman was here in Huntington last summer and it is said intends coming again next season. He is crippled from paralysis, is now in his 63d year; he still writes, lectures, gives readings from his works and travels moderately. The Boston Herald says of his poems: </p><p>'One of the great features of Walt Whitman is that he does not seek his ideals in faraway times, which, stripped of their glamor of remoteness, are but as the times of to-day; for in supreme moments, he idealizes the common-place, and has the clearness of vision that discerns the gleam of gold through all the accumulated dross.</p><p>The large and magnificent tolerance that includes all and allows all, and finds a place for all, is a sublime characteristic of the man. There is much in these lines that cannot be packed into layers of equal length. The book teems with the ecstacy of being. The statement of details into which the poet now and then drops has been criticised as 'cataloguing.' But viewed with the poet\u2019s intention, what a mosaic picture of the people, of the nation and its races, is thus constituted! One sees the stir and hears the hum of the entire land; feels the pulse of the multitude. What is the use of attempting to depict such a thing\u2014it can't all be shown. But the effect is like a gleam of sunshine in the depths of a forest; it reveals many things with vivid distinctness; there is a vast reserve of hidden things which might be seen, but enough is shown to tell what is there\u2014to give the character of the place.</p><p>The new edition contains all his poems; the only changes that have been made are in the way of condensation of utterance. There are, also, something like 20 new poems printed direct from the manuscript. There is more of a rounding and completeness of the work; the all-embracing patriotism which forms one of the poet\u2019s grandest characteristic is more comprehensive than ever before manifested.'</p><p><em>FROM WALT WHITMAN'S NEW BOOK. </em><br><p><em>PATROLING BARNEGAT.</em></p><p>Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,<br>Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant under-tone muttering,<br>Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,<br>Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,<br>Out in the shadows there, milk-white combs careering,<br>On beachy slush and sand, spirts of snow fierce slanting,<br>Where, through the murk, the easterly death-wind breasting,<br>Through cutting swirl and spray, watchful and firm advancing,<br>(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)<br>Slush and sand of the beach, tireless till daylight wending,<br>Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,<br>Along the midnight edge, by those milk-white combs careering,<br>A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,<br>That savage trinity warily watching.</p>", "date": "November 11 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "Charles E.

The answer must be, 'No.' The book is too radical, too free, too independent and far too true to make its conquest of a popular verdict an easy matter. To the question, 'Will the book and the man ever be popular?' the answer, in the opinion of the present writer, must be a qualified 'Yes.' Walt Whitman is, par excellence, the poet and priest of democracy\u2014the American type of democracy; the democracy based upon individuality, though not, perhaps, the ultimate democracy; the democracy based upon I, the individual; not the democracy based upon we, the sum of all individuals. In 'Leaves of Grass' Walt Whitman has personified\u2014or rather, idealized\u2014the genius of American democracy. The work cannot be separated into any number of complete and independent poems: it is one complete and all-embracing poem, the subject of which is the Kosmos. It is the Kosmos as viewed from the standpoint of the American idea of democracy\u2014the sovereignty of each and every individual. Walt Whitman is an individualist of the most pronounced type. So, while admitting that his grand psalms of the Universe will attain a gradual and limited popularity, attaining such popularity only as fast as they become popularly understood, their influence may diminish should ever the American idea of democracy\u2014individual sovereignty\u2014lose its hold on popular opinion.</p><p>Walt Whitman has written the drama\u2014it may be almost called the history\u2014of the first century of American civilization. It may be doubted whether it will fit the second century as well; indeed, how could that be expected, for is it possible to write</p><p><strong>The Drama of the Future!</strong></p><p>All that we can know of the future we have learned from the past and from what we can understand of the tendencies of this present time; but what poet or seer, let him be ever so wise, can forecast the future development\u2014even for one brief century\u2014of the wonderful, creative, multitudinous human mind? But let us take a survey of the book. Let us see how far it fits the foregoing remarks. First, as to the title\u2014why 'Leaves of Grass?' The author himself evidently loves the title, as is evinced by the ornamentation not only of the latest but of previous editions. His very signature on the cover reminds one of grass\u2014and it has a meaning. Let us read the opening in his own words:</p><p>'A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with <br>full hands;<br>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it <br>is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of <br>hopeful green-stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord.<br>A scented gift and rememberance designedly dropt.<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, <br>that we may see and remark, and say whose?</p><p>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced <br>babe of the vegetation.</p><p>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike is broad zones and <br>narrow zones.<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I gave them <br>the same, I receive the same.</p><p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of <br>graves.<br>. . . . . . . . <br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death.<br>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not <br>wait at the end to arrest it,<br>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.</p><p>All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,<br>And to die is different from what any one supposed, <br>and luckier.'</p><p>'Leaves of Grass,' then, are not only symbolical of all the great alchemy of nature, of all creation, all production, all evolution, but symbolical of immortality as well\u2014the permanence and indestructability of all things. And so the title is good.</p><p>What of the man? What of Walt Whitman himself? This brings us to one of the most interesting features of the book; indeed, the key to its entire plan-its marked personality. It was not by mere whim or caprice\u2014much less by accident or any publisher's device\u2014that the unique portrait of the author (the only illustration of the volume) is not in the usual place, fronting the title-page, but incorporated in the verse, and accompanied by his account of his own relation to his work and to the reader. This is introduced as a</p><p><strong>Song of Myself.</strong></p><p>and is carried through fifty-two stanzas, occupying fifty pages. The portrait, copied from a daguerreotype taken in 1856, when he was a working carpenter, as well as an unhatched poet\u2014represents him in the loose shirt, open at the neck and lapping over the waist of the unbraced pants of an ordinary mechanic; his flannel undershirt revealed; a broad-brimmed, soft felt hat carelessly thrown back sideways on his head, which is inclined in the same way.

what has been written and quoted serve to give some idea of the spirit and meaning of this wonderful poem of humanity and the universe? It has been written with the hope that it may, but with no expectation of doing anything like justice to the vast range of observation, profundity and minuteness of analysis, philosophic and religious interpretation, intimate knowledge and deep and earnest sympathy, not only with all humanity but with all nature, that</p><p><strong>Place this Book in the Front Rank</strong></p><p>of the highest branches of American literature. One might as well try to epitomize Shakespeare in a newspaper article as to try to do so with 'Leaves of Grass.' That all who read this imperfect review will be induced thereby to read and study the volume for themselves, and become greater, nobler and happier by the experience, is the earnest hope of the writer.</p><p>The following appreciative opinion of, that other faithful student of nature\u2014Thoreau\u2014written in 1856, and therefore at a time when even a man of his independence could hardly be expected to be very outspoken in the face of social prudery, will be read with interest, and will be a fitting appendix to what has been already said:</p><p>'He (Whitman) is apparently the greatest democrat the world has seen; a remarkably strong, though coarse nature, of a sweet disposition, and much prized by his friends. Though peculiar and rough in his exterior, his skin, all over, red, he is essentially a gentleman. I am still in some quandary about him\u2014feel that he is essentially strange to me, at any rate; but am surprised by the sight of him. He is very broad, but not fine . . . . He has long been an editor and writer for the newspapers\u2014was editor for the N.O. Crescent once . . . . Since I have seen him, I am not disturbed by any brag or egoism in his book. He is a great fellow. There are two or three pieces in the book which are disagreeable, at least, simply sensual. He does not celebrate love at all. It is as if the beasts spoke. I think men have not been ashamed of themselves without reason. No doubt there have always been dens where such deeds were unblushingly recited, and it is no merit to compete with such. But even on this side he has spoken more truth than any modern I know. [What of Shakespeare, Byron and Burns?] I have found his poem exhilarating, encouraging. [Emerson uses a similar expression.] As for its sensuality\u2014and it may be less so than it seems\u2014I do not so much wish those parts unwritten, as that men were so pure that they could read them without harm, that is without understanding them (?) . . . . On the whole it is to me very brave and American. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He occasionally suggests something a little more than human. How people must shudder as they read him? He is awfully good. To be sure I sometimes feel a little imposed on. By his heartiness and broad generalities he puts me into a liberal frame of mind prepared to see wonders\u2014as it were sets me upon a hill or in the midst of a plain\u2014stirs me well up and then\u2014throws in a thousand of brick. Though rude and sometimes ineffectual, it is a good primitive poem\u2014an alarum or trumpet-note ringing through the American camp. Wonderfully like the Orientals, too, considering that when I asked if he had read them he answered, 'No; tell me about them.''</p><p>Thoreau has evidently written just what he felt when the surprise and what may be called the shock of an unprecedented revelation was fresh upon him. His candor and his good judgment, under the circumstances, is worthy of all commendation, but he might write differently today were he alive.</p>", "date": "November 13 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Boston Globe", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"'Leaves of Grass'.\" 13 November 1881.

This Whitman has done, and something more than this. When in 1855 he printed with his own hands his odd and sprawling lines of his 'Leaves of Grass' (a few copies, long since out of print, though hardly any one bought them), he announced himself to the world as a poet, and he has never since taken down his sign. He still carries on business at the own stand; still 'sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' But now instead of six readers he has six thousand, or perhaps six hundred thousand and the back countries have not all been heard from yet. That they understand him we would not guarantee\u2014he does not understand himself always; still less did he understand himself when he began to write. He put to sea on a raft and his only compass was a looking-glass, but he has made as good a voyage on the whole as if he had sailed in the Great Eastern with all the compasses and chronometers and astronomers on board.</p><p>'Were it the will of heaven an osier bough<br>Were vessel strong enough the seas to plow.'</p><p>So said Pindar, only more shortly,\u2014and Whitman has verified the oracle. Courage and trust are the best outfit for a poet, it seems; they are worth all the colleges and libraries in the world. The world itself is the poet's library, and Whitman has had a card to that collection; he has even attempted a catalogue; but like all library catalogues it grows beyond his power to list and index. </p><p>There is a lawless saying, fit only for the wise, but full of meaning for poets and great captains,\u2014</p><p>'Oft have I heard, and deem the witness true,<br>Whom man delights in, God delights in too.'</p><p>But the career of pleasure and admiration which is only possible to power soon finds its limits in human experience, and must be corrected by the sharp lessons of sorrow and mortification,\u2014must be continued, if at all, by the completest self-renunciation and trust in the unseen powers. This discipline Whitman has had, it would seem, and has profited by it. His later poems are not quite in the key of his earlier; they have a more serious and religious tone; and their light is thrown back on the dangerous utterances of his youth. He has not rejected these utterances,\u2014has indeed preserved most of them in this new volume,-but has softened them, changed their connection and brought them into a better accord with a life of service to mankind, such as the poet's must be if he would live beyond his own age. Consequently this book will be received, we fancy, as none of Whitman's former books have been. It will no longer be a work prohibited, but, in spite of many passages which must always keep it from a familiar place on the table, and from the perfect liberty of unformed judgments,\u2014it will find its way into all good libraries and into many homes. For the civil war made Whitman a domestic poet, which he had hardly been before. The clear recognition and pathetic portrayal of the home affection in the Americans, not less than their patriotism and devotion to democracy, gives 'Drum Taps' an affectionate place in the hearts of his readers. The philosophy of 'Leaves of Grass' was oriental,\u2014grand, but peculiar, and to the multitude either irreligious or suspicious,\u2014but this was changed in the war-poems into a spirit which the multitude could understand, because they shared it,\u2014which, indeed, was born of the multitude and possessed Whitman as one of the many, not as among the few. Another change noticeable in him at that time and since affected his meter and the melody of his verse. The measure of the old chapters in 'Leaves of Grass' can hardly be called a meter at all: what rhythm it had was rather like the rhythm of Hebrew poetry, in the antithesis or repetition of ideas, not in the harmonious arrangement of words. But it would seem as if the music of the regiments:\u2014</p><p>'Sonorous metal blowing martial sound,'</p><p>had suggested to Whitman a new movement for his lines.3 They soon became measured and choral in their character,\u2014not a set measure, like the tweedle-de-dum, tweedle-de-dee of the mediocre poets, but a dithyrambic orchestral movement, responding to chords struck at irregular intervals, and leaving the mind free to catch up the next strain, wherever it might come in. This in part is the secret of the Greek chorus-poetry, to which (though the Greek measures are more balanced and mutually responsive) the war pieces of Whitman, and much of his later poetry, bears a strong resemblance. The book deserves study even as a metrical anomaly, were it not entitled to consideration upon much higher regards.</p><p>Lofty as any sound estimate of Whitman's book must be, it has faults enough to have long ago destroyed the reputation of any writer who had not something better than singularity to commend him. Concerning these, as well as for a larger consideration of his work and place, we shall take another time to speak. Here we say only that the book is a noble one, and must be so adjudged before any proper discount upon its merits can be made.</p>", "date": "November 13 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Springfield Sunday Republican", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman, a Kosmos.\" 13 November 1881.

James H. Osgood & Co. </p><p>After the dilettante indelicacies of William H. Malleck and Oscar Wilde, we are presented with the slop-bucket of Walt Whitman. The celebrity of this phenomenal poet bears a curious disproportion to the circulation of his writings. Until now, it cannot be said that his verses have ever been published at all. They have been printed irregularly and read behind the door. They have been vaunted extravagantly by a band of extravagant disciples; and the possessors of the books have kept them locked up from the family. Some have valued them for the 'barbaric yawp,' which seems to them the note of a new, vigorous, democratic, American school of literature; some for the fragments of real poetry floating in the turbid mass; some for the nastiness and animal insensibility to shame which entitle a great many of the poems to a dubious reputation as curiosities. Now that they are thrust into our faces at the book stalls there must be a reexamination of the myth of the Good Gray Poet. It seems to me that there is no need at this late day to consider Mr. Whitman's claims to the immortality of genius. That he is a poet most of us frankly admit. His merits have been set forth many times, and at great length, and if the world has erred materially in its judgment of them the error has been a lazy and unquestioning acquiescence in some of the extreme demands of his vociferous partisans. The chief question raised by this publication is whether anybody\u2014even a poet\u2014ought to take off his trousers in the market place. Of late years we believe that Mr. Whitman has not chosen to be so shocking as he was when he had his notoriety to make, and many of his admirers\u2014the rational ones\u2014hoped that the 'Leaves of Grass' would be weeded out before he set them out again. But this has not been done; and indeed Mr. Whitman could hardly do it without falsifying the first principle of his philosophy, which is a belief in his own perfection, and the second principle, which is a belief in the preciousness of filth. 'Divine am I,' he cries. 'Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from. The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer. This head more than churches, Bibles and all the creeds.' He knows that he is 'august.' He does not care for anybody's opinion. He is </p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos of Manhattan the son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no slander above men and women or apart from them.<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>There is nothing in the universe better than Walt Whitman. That is the burden of the 'Song of Myself' which fills fifty pages of the present volume: </p><p>I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious.</p><p>Nothing is obscene or indecent to him. It is his mission to shout the forbidden voices, to tear the veil off everything, to clarify and transfigure all that is dirty and vile, to proclaim that garbage is just as good as nectar if you are only lusty enough to think so. His immodesty is free from glamour of every sort. Neither amatory sentiment nor susceptibility to physical beauty appears to have anything to do with it. It is entirely bestial; and in this respect we know of nothing in literature which can be compared with it. Walt Whitman, despising what he calls conventionalism, and vaunting the athletic democracy, asks to be accepted as the master of a new poetical school, fresh, free, stalwart, 'immense in passion, pulse and power,' the embodiment of the spirit of vigorous America. But the gross materialism of his verses represents art in its last degradation rather than its rude infancy.</p>", "date": "November 19 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "New-York Tribune", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"New Publications.\" 19 November 1881.

It will be noticed that at last he has found a publisher other than himself. What this nation may become it might not be wise to prophesy; but we may at the start humbly entertain the hope, at least, that at this present writing our nationality, in root and fiber, is something else than what Mr. Whitman sings. His book is one of courage, most downright in its dogmatics, and says its say apparently without the slightest consideration for the fact that much it says must cross and shock the deepest ethical instincts of a great multitude\u2014we should certainly hope the vast majority of those American men and women who by any misfortune are led to read him. For these poems are of that breed that they force the honest critic into a corner where he must either speak plain words, or step down and out from his judgment-seat. This is a book which makes not only war upon nearly all traditional theories of true poetry, but in many places a very brutal assault upon our fixed ideas of human decency and purity. For instance, it has long been held that poetry is not merely the prose of any philosophy, history, geography, anthropology, or, we might add, anatomy or sexual physiology; but must have some sort of inherent rhythm and melody\u2014the heartbeats and spiritual pulsations of the poet. This, for want of a better term, we call the form of poetry. Tennyson, for example, is a master of poetic form. The poems under review, as to form, run to a chaos of monotonies. It is not the chaotic diversity of the wild woods, or the sea waves, or the autumn leaves, or the sand grains in a gravel-pit, in all which there is the articulated beauty and inbred virtue of nature obedient to the Great Craftsman. The chaos of Mr. Whitman's verse, to compare great with small, reminds us of the gray clay bluffs of Truro Beach. Would it were as clean! In form he reminds us of Martin Farquhar Tupper.</p><p>There is vastly more to be said as to his substance. First of all, and gladly, this: that he has, in his nigh four hundred pages, spurts and flashes of some things which say: 'This could and should have been a noble creature.' He has a quick, sharp sight for the surfaces of natural scenery, as when he speaks of the 'heart-shaped' leaf of the lilac; but somehow he seems incapable of grasping the inner spiritual lessons of field and flood, or a spiritual analogy. The best instance of the opposite we have found on a careful search is this:</p><p>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of <br>the stars (p. 53).</p><p>His grasp of the detail of an event, but not of its ethical quality, is shown in his description of a sea-fight [pp. 62-63]. Somehow he never shows us the soul of anything. We may ask even, 'Does he believe there is any such thing as a soul?' American he is, of the ruder and more barbaric type, a prairie cow boy in a buffalo robe, with a voice of the east wind, shouting prophecies and incantations about what he thinks he sees and knows. But from civilized speech or melody he seems strangely remote. Egotism, if a virtue, is certainly an unfragrant one, and Walt Whitman's egotism, grotesque as it is, is perhaps less grotesque than gigantic. He describes himself well enough in the lines,</p><p>I am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable\u2014 <br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p> <p>Mr. Whitman's religion is no doubt to him a serious matter, and it is a somewhat serious matter to discover what in the world it is. He often discourses eloquently of God, as when (p. 76) he says:</p><p>I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is <br>signed by God's name,<br>And I leave them where they are for I know that whereso-<br>ever I go<br>Others will punctually come forever and ever.</p><p>Yet the prevalent tone of his verses is curiously Asiatic, as though he were an incarnation of Brahma, and a pantheist. He says (p. 31):</p><p>Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that <br>is not my soul.</p><p>(A cess-pool, for instance).</p><p>In fact, he declares himself to be all that the universe is, even to being at the same moment each of two exactly opposite things, as though a man at any given instant were and were not. Indeed, it is this rapt but noisy mysticism which makes it rather hard to finger Mr. Whitman and touch his quality. Not that true poetry does not allow mysticism, or that mystics are not often poets. Indeed, high poetry is often a blessed hint, and only a hint, of a vaster world within the veil of the unreachable and the non- measurable.</p><p>Uhland's ballad, 'The Two Locks of Hair,' for instance, hints at the draped and veiled world of sorrow, whose mysteries are only revealed to the mourners after here. Mr. Whitman's mysticism is a fog-bank that cloaks all, even the possible hint itself. Add to this his all-pervading oracularity of speech, and he is certainly a man hard to be 'understanded' of common folk. And yet there are gleams in his book, not only of great things, but of possibly magnificent ones. His tribute to Abraham Lincoln (p. 262), beginning 'O Captain! my Captain!' is a weird and rare performance. 'The Singer in the Prison' (p. 292) beginning</p><p>O sight of pity, shame and dole <br>O fearful thought\u2014a convict soul,</p><p>is full of tenderness and pathos.</p><p>The ethical quality of Mr. Whitman's poems remains to be examined. Here, in all honesty, it is hard to know what to say or what to leave unsaid. Gray hairs have their rights, and ought to be a shield against taunt and bitterness; but woman's purity and human society have their rights also, and there are little children growing up into the arena of the world's toil and trial who have their rights as well. We go now upon the assumption that there are certain elements of decency which pervade all human society, heathen and otherwise, and that the world is not too old to blush. We say that there are passages in this book that never ought to have been written, much less published; passages which sound like a lecture on the obstetrics of lust and (may we say it with all deference to our well-bred readers) the apotheosis of the Phallus. It is hard to overstate this matter. When a man with such physical imagery of shame sum- mons the very wind (p. 49) to be assistant in a poetical concubinage as realistic as a French invisible card, and the salt sea also (p. 46), it is certainly time for us common mortals who have still some respect for the seventh commandment to stay in doors from the elements, or, if at sea, to make all speed for the shore. The offense in this wise is not all-pervading, but it is very acute and deep.</p><p>His apologists will say of him that he is only another Adam in the Garden, naked and not ashamed. We say of him, and of all who have assisted in the making of his book, that they are guilty of an act of indecent exposure. For the rest, what Mr. Whitman might have been in poetry we have tried to fairly state. We can only add that if in these Leaves of Grass he has shown himself to be a poet, then the great and shining ones whom the English-speaking race have been wont to honor with this high title, are not.</p><p><em>Leaves of Grass James R.

It was inevitable that the force of his genius should carry, sooner or later, the inner citadel of respectable literature; but the event has been delayed for a quarter of a century. During that time he has been his own printer and bookseller. Containing passages which under a strict construction of certain statutes of the United States could not be permitted to pass through the mails, the privately printed volumes have found a constantly increasing number of purchasers and readers. The accessions have not been from the ranks of the depraved and prurient. Walt Whitman's audience has grown, not by reason of, but in spite of, his frank disregard of some of the proprieties of utterance. Of this side of the matter it is enough to say that if the new edition is a triumph for the poet, it has been achieved without any concession on his part. He has modified nothing. He has cancelled no objectionable line or offensive phrase. He has confessed no sin against good taste or decency. In pushing his way into his present company he has not for an instant hauled in his elbows.</p><p>In another respect the appearance of the new edition of 'Leaves of Grass' is an interesting event. For the first time, the poet can be judged by his poetic scheme in its entirety. The additional verses are not so important in themselves as in the relation of parts to a completed whole. Walt Whitman's admirers have always insisted that criticism before the final development of the plan was premature. The poet has compared his work to one of those ambitious old architectural edifices, built part by part at long intervals, and showing the designer's idea only when the last stone was in place. The gaps have now all been filled. The revision of the several poems, and their rearrangement with reference to the sub-titles and to each other, leave them, we are told, as they were designed to be.</p><p>While Walt Whitman has kept steadily on his way, unshaken in belief in his mission and uncompromising as to his methods, he has provoked a difference of public opinion more marked, perhaps, than in the case of any author now alive. His aggressiveness seems to leave no middle ground. He is either a genius of colossal proportions or an immense windbag; either to be hailed and worshipped or to be punctured. A considerable part of his contemporaries hold him to be beneath criticism; a small circle of ardent admirers exalt him above it. The poet himself, it is to be feared, is prone to encourage the latter view. Every page that he has written discloses an egotism that reaches the verge of sublimity. He is impatient even of discriminating eulogy. He is said to hold as no better than a vender of scurrilities a friend of his, himself a poet, who not long ago published a magazine article in which the laudation of 'Leaves of Grass' was measured instead of being unreserved. With Walt it is: Take me or leave me; but if you take me, take me as the Consummate Man. In estimating a singer and seer this indomitable self-confidence is a quality that ought not to be overlooked. To refuse to admit it as corroborative proof of genius would be to reject one of the lessons of biography. Walt's vigorous personality and the purity and na\u2039ve simplicity of his private life have drawn about him a circle of devoted friends. They cannot understand why his genius should be denied or overlooked any more than they can see how the existence of the sun can be denied or overlooked when it is shining in a clear sky at noonday. They are exasperated because the great public is so slow to accept the poet at their valuation and his own. On the other hand, those to whom Whitman is a noisy madman, or a disturber of the poetic peace, or a bawler of platitudes, are reluctant to give the poet's adherents credit for any better motive than the affectation of eccentricity. The 'good gray poet' business disgusts them. They are puzzled by the admiration with which Whitman's achievements are regarded by Emerson and Tennyson and other bards who are as unlike the Bard of Paumanok as so many gentlemen in evening dress are unlike a gentleman in a diving suit. And all the while the belief is growing in cultivated minds that in Walt Whitman we have one of the most remarkable and original individualities in literature.</p><p>Let us look first at his method. It is from the superficial and non-essential characteristics of 'Leaves of Grass' that the popular conception of the poet is derived. The oddities, the whim-whams, the grotesque contrasts lie on the surface, lending themselves readily to burlesque, and affording plenty of material for ridicule.</p><p>Whitman's versification proceeds in the loosest possible fashion, discarding rhyme altogether, except in rare instances. A vague effect of rhythm is preserved, the c\u00e6sura recurring at irregular and often widely unequal intervals. It is an informal but roughly harmonious flow of words, sustaining the same relation to finished verse as the recitative to the aria. It is regarded by many as a startling innovation, but is really nothing more than a return to the earliest and most nearly spontaneous form of poetic expression. For purpose of comparison, as regards external form only, we place a passage from 'The Return of the Heroes' side by side with passages from the Sixty-fifth and One Hundred, and Fourth Psalms in the English version:</p><p>Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!<br>The season of thanks and the voice of full yielding,<br>The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.</p><p>All tilled and untilled lands expand before me,<br>I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,<br>Man's innocent and strong arenas.</p><p>I see the heroes of other toils,<br>I see well wielded in their hands the better weapons.</p><p>I see where the Mother of All.<br>With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long.<br>And counts the varied gathering of the products.</p><p>Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,<br>Prairie,orchard, and yellow grain of the North,<br>Cotton and rice of the South, and Louisiana cane,<br>Open unseeded follows, rich fields of clover and timothy,<br>Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,<br>And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund <br>brook,<br>And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,<br>And the good, green grass, that delicate miracle the ever- <br>recurring grass.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion;<br>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh<br>come.<br>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness.</p><p>Thy paths drop fatness, they drop upon the pastures of<br>the wilderness;<br>And the little hills rejoice on every side.</p><p>The pastures are clothed with flocks.<br>The valleys also are covered over with corn.</p><p>Bless the Lord,O my soul!<br>O Lord, my God, thou art very great;<br>Thou art clothed with honor and majesty.</p><p>He watereth the hills from his chambers;<br>The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.<br>He sendeth the springs into the valleys;<br>By them shall the fowls of the heavens have their hab- itationhabitation.<br>They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild<br>asses quench their thirst.<br>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and the<br>herb for the service of man.</p><p>Again, we present the 'Address to the Sun,' of Ossian-Macpherson,1 in passages alternate with those of Walt Whitman's invocation of the same orb. In neither case is assistance given to the rhythm by artificial division of the verses. The interest of the comparison will be found to extend beyond the matter of form:</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers. Whence are thy beams, O Sun! thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the western way; but thou thyself movest alone.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling, thou hot October noon! Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand, the sibilant near sea with vistas far, and foam, and tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue; O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>Who can be a companion of thy course! The oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves decay with years: the ocean shrinks and grows again; the moon itself is lost in heaven; but thou art forever the same, rejoicing in the brightness of thy course.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Hear me illustrious! Thy lover me, for always have I loved thee, even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood-edge, thy touching-distant beams enough, or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>When the world is dark with tempests, when thunder rolls and lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to Ossian thou lookest in vain, for he beholds thy beams no more: whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds, or thou tremblest at the gates of the west.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Thou that with fructifying heat and light, o'er myriad farms, o'er land and waters North and South, o'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kanada's woods, o'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining inspace; thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas: thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally, shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of the million millions. Strike through these chants.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>But thou art, perhaps, like me, for a season: thy years will have an end. Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds, careless of the voice of the morning. Exalt, then, O Sun, in the strength of thy youth! Age is dark and unlovely: it is like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines through broken clouds, and the mist is on the hills; the blast of the North is on the plain, the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these; prepare the later afternoon of me myself\u2014prepare my lengthening shadows, prepare my starry nights.</p><p>This reversion to a primitive mode of poetic expression is particularly interesting, occurring as it does at a time when a certain school of English- speaking poets are paying so much heed to the merely mechanical and musical qualities of verse. Whitman wastes no strength in the elaboration of metres, of rhyme, of assonance, of refrain. He does not stop to think of melody. There is no doubt that his method is that of the least friction\u2014the least amount of idea rubbed off in the process of conformation. Nor is there any doubt that it is the method best suited to his genius; it seems to be the natural language of his genius. His sturdy egotism, his sympathy with living Nature and with Man in action, are poured forth in a torrent of words unhampered by the laws of prosody. Fancy the untamable, untranslatable Walt pottering over rondeaux, or elaborating canzonets, or measuring off fourteen lines to the idea! In the three or four poems which have rhyme and the stanza, the rhymes are of the crudest and the stanzas are fetters:</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done.<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought <br>is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and <br>daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O,the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>A strange thing about Whitman's rugged recitative is that it never becomes monotonous. Within apparently narrow limits of possible variation, he manages to secure a wonderful variety. His longest cumulative passages, his catalogues of natural objects, catalogues of occupations, geographical and physiological lists, are something more than catalogues and lists. The art may be unconscious, but the result shows him a perfect master of the poetic accent. Walt Whitman would have made the catalogue of ships in the 'Iliad' a poem in itself. Where his voice sounds in the minor key the music is often so dainty that we fail to notice the absence of the conventional lyric forms. Some lines in 'Sea Drift' sound like a snatch of one of Shakespeare's songs:</p><p>Two together! <br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north, <br>Day come white, or white come black, <br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home, <br>Singing all time, minding no time, <br>While we two keep together. </p><p><em>Low hangs the moon, it rose late, It is lagging\u2014O I think it is heavy with love, with love\u2014 </em></p><p>We have been speaking of some of the surface characteristics of Walt Whitman's poetry. If all poets were in the habit of using this recitative rhythm as a vehicle for their thoughts, what qualities would still distinguish him from the rest?</p><p>It seems to us that Walt Whitman is the truest representative of the reactionary movement against romanticism\u2014the movement in which Emile Zola is a noisy and mercenary incidental. What he has undertaken to do is to exhibit with absolute unreserve the mind of a modern man in its relations to nature and to modern society. See me, says Walt, the average man of the nineteenth century, just as I am, with all the conventions and lies and shame stripped off, leaving my intellectual and emotional processes absolutely naked to view. See me as I am, bodily, too, if you care for the spectacle\u2014every rag stripped off. And thus unclad, morally and physically, he proceeds to execute all the gymnastic antics that suggest themselves to the imagination of the child of nature when he is freed from the restraint of clothing and set out in the sunlight.</p><p>It is not from any lack of conscientious intention that the poet fails in part of his purpose, and instead of achieving a portrait of the real Walt gives us an approximate Walt, a partly real, partly ideal Walt. No man that ever lived has succeeded in making a complete exposure of himself. In the most intimate confidences there are still nooks and corners over which vanity does and always will insist on drawing the veil. Still, Whitman goes at his work lustily, and with many advantages. The individuality which he exhibits is interesting. His courage is dauntless. His sympathy with the external world is genuine; his heart beats in true accord with the heart of nature. He is a born poet, with imagination of a high order\u2014the imagination which creates new material instead of moulding old stuff into new forms. As compared with Tennyson, for instance, who justly admires him, he is an architect who has conceived a plan and built an edifice, not merely an artist engaged in beautifying with exquisite skill the walls of a structure centuries old. Walt Whitman has found poetry in the so-called commonplace objects of Nineteenth century life. He views at night the 'far-sprinkled systems,' but he views them through a Nineteenth century scuttle, constructed by a carpenter of today. The scuttle is as poetic an orifice as the oriel or the mullioned window of the bartizan tower; but,being an essentially modern conception, it does not enjoy the prestige which they have in conventional verse. Whitman exults in showing side by side the sublime or the beautiful that has always been acknowledged as such, and the sublime or the beautiful unacknowledged and unrecognized by everybody but himself. He goes forth at night and sings:</p><p>I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by night.<br>Press close, bare-bosomed night; press close magnetic, <br>nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds\u2014night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night\u2014mad naked summer night!</p><p>Smile O voluptuous cool breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset\u2014earth of the mountains misty- <br>topt!<br>Earth or the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged <br>with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer <br>for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbow'd earth\u2014rich apple blossom'd earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.<br>Prodigal, you have given me love\u2014therefore I to you <br>give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love.</p><p>And with equal joy he contemplates the gigantic black driver of a dray:</p><p>The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the<br>block swags underneath it on its tied-over chain,<br>The negro that drives the long dray of the stone yard,<br>steady and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string- <br>piece. <br>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and<br>loosens over his hip band,<br>His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the<br>slouch of his hat away from his forehead.<br>The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on<br>the black of his polished and perfect limbs.</p><p>His idea of supreme beauty is man, at his best, in contact with nature\u2014the naked body of the swimmer battling with the waves, the locomotive driving through the snowdrift, the woodsman swinging his broadaxe, the lusty farmer swinging his scythe, outdoor life, the ship at sea, muscle and pluck forever! No poet has ever echoed more accurately the whirr and roar of the restless, every-day life of the world, the infinitely complex movement of human activity, the rush of the planet through space, the resultant sound of all mingled sounds. This booms like the distant voice of the ocean in some of Goethe's lines, but Goethe never came nearer the laboratory of the universe than Whitman in 'Eid\u03cclons':</p><p>Ever the dim beginning,<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle,<br>Ever the summit and the merge at last (to surely start <br>again),<br>Eid\u03cclons! Eid\u03cclons!</p><p>Ever the mutable,<br>Ever materials changing, crumbling, re-cohering,<br>Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,<br>Issuing Eid\u03cclons!</p><p>The misfortune is that Walt Whitman, not content with his discovery of the value of the spirit of the Nineteenth century and the Modern Man as poetic material, seeks to elevate it into a democratic philosophy, or new religion of humanity. That he regards himself as the prophet of new ideas which loom awfully, but somewhat vaguely, behind the framework of his verses, is shown by abundant evidence. It would perhaps puzzle him to write out in cold prose the cardinal points of his social and religious philosophy, or, having done so, to demonstrate that they contain anything more than the ancient commonplaces. The abstract idea of universal brotherhood, of which the kiss between man and man is his not agreeable poetic type, the equality of man with man and of man with God, some taking truisms afforded by an imperfect acquaintance with the literature of metaphysical thought, a constant insistence on the doctrines of stirpiculture, a firm conviction in the majesty of the People\u2014is not this the sum of the new creed of which he declares himself over and over again the embodiment, and which leads him to the final audacity of a comparison of his own mission with that of Christ?</p><p>E.

J., some twenty years later. In his volume all the objectionable passages which were the cause of so much complaint at the time of their first appearance are given entire without a word changed or omitted. It was said of Mr. Mallock by an English reviewer, that in his last novel he had introduced 'the beastly into literature.' Considering some of the unexpurgated lines in this volume, Mr. Whitman is entitled to the honorable position of the apostle of the beastly in poetry. Nothing that Swinburne\u2014a kindred unclean spirit, of greater intellectual power, however\u2014ever wrote compares with the foulness of some of the 'good gray poet's' verse. The lines might be appropriate over the portals of a bawdy house, but not in a volume of poetry from a respectable publishing firm, intended for general circulation.</p><p>Mr. Whitman has been so long silent that the leading facts in his career are generally forgotten. He is now in his 63d year, having been born in 1819 at West Hills, on Long Island. His father was an Englishman and his mother from Holland. During his life he has worked as printer, carpenter, school-teacher, army-nurse, and clerk in the office of the Attorney-General. He has traveled quite extensively, and has suffered of late years from partial paralysis. For a proper appreciation of his poetry a peculiarly cultured taste is required. Claiming to be a writer for and of the people, those to whom Whitman appeals have shown the least sympathy with him and the greatest ignorance of the inspirations of his muse. Possibly we do not comprehend Whitman. Certainly we fail to enjoy what he is pleased to call his poetry. To any of Carlyle's heavily-capitalized pages the same title might be applied with equal force. The difficulty is to understand why it would not be equally effective and striking if entitled 'prose.' Take as an instance the poem entitled 'Our Old Feuillage':</p><p>Always our old feuillage!<br>Always Florida's green peninsula\u2014always the <br>priceless delta of Louisiana\u2014always the cot- <br>ton-fields of Alabama and Texas,<br>Always California's golden hills, and hollows, and <br>the silver mountains of New Mexico\u2014always <br>soft-breath'd Cuba,<br>Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern <br>Sea, inseparable with the slopes drain'd by <br>the Eastern and Western Seas,<br>The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and <br>bay-coast on the main, the thirty thousand <br>miles of river navigation,<br>The seven millions of distinct families and the <br>same number of dwellings\u2014always these, <br>and more, branching forth into numberless <br>branches,<br>Always the free range and diversity\u2014always the <br>continent of Democracy;<br>Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast <br>cities, travelers, Kanada the snows:<br>Always these compact lands tied at the hips <br>with the belt stringing the huge oval lakes\u2014</p><p>Thus, in the same strain, this so-called poetry runs on for four pages without a single period! It is true that Walt Whitman has been praised by such high authorities in literature as Emerson, Tennyson, and Ruskin. Their eulogies, however, were rather on the thoughts and sentiments of the author than praise of his versification. His power is rugged and his controlling impulse, apart from his egotism, is to say whatever occurs to him at the moment, whether relevant or irrelevant. He lacks both rhyme and rhythm. His is imaginative, but not metrical, composition; the fruit of an excited imagination, but without measured form. If we call him a great poet, and judge him by his writings, where shall we assign our Longfellow or Whittier, tried on the same kind of evidence? Macaulay has as broad and liberal a definition of ars poetica as anyone. 'By poetry,' he says, 'we mean the art of employing words in such a manner as to produce an illusion on the imagination; the art of doing by means of words what the painter does by means of colors.' Now, if we take one or two of Walt Whitman's best efforts, how does he fulfill these requirements? Here is a little bit called 'Aboard at a Ship's Helm':</p><p>Aboard at a ship's helm,<br>A young steersman steering with care.</p><p>Through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing,<br>An ocean-bell\u2014O a warning bell rocked by the <br>waves.</p><p>O you give a good notice indeed, you bell by the <br>sea-reefs ringing,<br>Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its <br>wreck-place.</p><p>For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the <br>loud admonition.<br>The bows turn, the freighted ship tacking speeds <br>away under her gray sails,<br>The beautiful and noble ship with all her pre-<br>cious wealth speeds away gayly and safe.</p><p>But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard <br>the ship!<br>Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, <br>voyaging, voyaging.</p><p>Or take a few lines from another poem:</p><p>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country <br>by road, lo, such faces!<br>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, <br>ideality,<br>The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome <br>common benevolent face,<br>The face of the singing of music, the grand faces <br>of natural lawyers and judges broad at the <br>back-top,<br>The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the <br>brows, the shaved blanched faces of ortho-<br>dox citizens,<br>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning <br>artist's face,<br>The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the hand-<br>some detested or despised face.</p><p>This now is too lamentable a face for a man.<br>Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing <br>for it,<br>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it <br>wrig to its hole.<br>. . . . . . .</p><p>The face is a haze more chill than the Arctic sea,<br>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they <br>go.</p><p>Milton defines poetry as 'thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers'; and Chatfield says, 'Poetry is the music of thought, conveyed to us in the music of language.' Joubert happily puts it, 'Nothing which does not transport is poetry. The lyre is a winged instrument.' Let us see, then how a few lines from Whitman's 'Song of Myself' come up to the requirements of these authorities:</p><p>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs <br>to you.</p><p>I loafe and invite my soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of <br>summer grass.</p><p>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd <br>from this soil, this air.<br>Born here of parents born here from parents <br>the same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.</p><p>Creeds and schools in abeyance,<br>Retiring back awhile sufficed at what they are, <br>but never forgotten,<br>I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at <br>every hazard,<br>Nature without check with original energy.</p><p>Take some of the shorter poems. Here is an ode to 'Beautiful Women':</p><p>Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some <br>young,<br>The young are beautiful\u2014but the old are more <br>beautiful than the young.</p><p>Here is another, entitled 'Thought':</p><p>Of obedience, faith, adhesiveness;<br>As I stand aloof and look there is to me some-<br>thing profoundly affecting in large masses <br>of men following the lead of those who do <br>not believe in men.</p><p>Ruskin considers that 'It is a shallow criticism that would define poetry as confined to literary productions in rhyme and metre. The written poem is only poetry talking, and the statue, the picture, and the musical composition are poetry acting. Milton and Goethe, at their desks, were not more truly poets than Phidias with his chisel, Raphael at his easel, or deaf Beethoven bending over his piano, inventing and producing strains which he himself could never hope to hear'\u2014and this great critic, Ruskin, say Whitman's admirers, has praised our hero! So be it! Phidias and Raphael and Beethoven were judged in accordance with the merits of what they produced. Their 'acted poetry' stood the test of the most acute analysis and was given prominent rank because it was perfection. In the same manner 'talking poetry,' by whoever written, must satisfy the eye, the ear, the mind, the heart, all the higher mental faculties in order to be classed as true, genuine inspired poetry. Does this short poem meet these demands:</p><p><em>A GLIMPSE</em><br>A Glimpse, through an interstice caught,<br>Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-<br>room around the stove late of a winter <br>night, and I unremark'd seated in a corner,<br>Or a youth who loves me and whom I love, <br>silently approaching and seating himself <br>near, that he may hold me by the hand,<br>A long while amid the noises of coming and <br>going, of drinking and oath and smutty <br>jest,<br>There we two, content, happy in being to-<br>gether, speaking little, perhaps not a word.</p><p>See how easily Whitman's verse becomes prose, and what would be the spontaneous criticism on any author who should write such prose:</p><p><em>WALT WHITMAN.</em><br>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling, thou hot October noon! Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand, the sibilant near sea with vistas far, and foam, and tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue; O sun of noon refulgent! My special word to thee. Hear me illustrious! Thy lover me, for always have I loved thee, even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some woodedge, thy touching-distant beams enough, or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation. Thou that with fructifying beat and light, o'er myriad farms, o'er land and waters North and South, o'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kanada's woods, o'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space; thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas; thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally, shed, shed thyself on mine and me, but with a fleeting ray out of the million millions. Strike through these chants. Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these; prepare the later afternoon of me myself\u2014prepare my lengthening shadows, prepare my starry nights.</p><p>There is no thought of melody, of the mechanical requirements of verse. It is simply a combination of words like unto the bits of glass in the child's kaleidoscope. Is it the language of a real genius or the voice of a ponderous fool? Whitman himself partially answers the question in a song from which we have already quoted. He is:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, and<br> breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women, or apart from them.<br>No more modest than immodest.<br>. . . . . . <br>I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all <br>so luscious. </p><p>This is the pen picture of himself by the man claiming to be the apostle of a new art, instead of being really the apostle of a great art in its most degraded form. There is no necessity for further quotation. We can admire the native, rugged strength of Whitman's unhampered genius. His active, brilliant imagination and his far-reaching enthusiasm seeking expression in language\u2014in words that shall fire the heart and excite the mind\u2014are characteristics of an extraordinary nature. So too his command of language and, apparently inexhaustible vocabulary is remarkable in a man with such antecedents and personal history. But these qualities do not make him a great poet. And to rank him as such is, to our thinking, to establish an entirely new standard from that which we have been wont to apply to the great masters of song. If they are true poets, then is Whitman a false one; if he is a poetic genius, then were the most honored names of literature but poetasters and 'pitiful rhymers.' </p><p>Published in Boston by J. R.

The book is running over with the writer's own personality and the two must be treated as one. Walt and his work are older, whiter, more mature; not wiser, but quieter; the mad turbulence hushed a little and some pruning done; yet the same sight, undimmed, immortal; Leaves of Grass, still green and vital as ever, but now growing close about many a solid rock of fame; the man and his work, among the oddest, if not the most beautiful, things of the present century.</p><p>I, the Titan, the hard-mouthed mechanic, spending my <br>life in the hurling of words.</p><p>In an age of short hair, and cropped beards, and close-fitting contained 'pants,' and neck wear, a man that persists in letting his hair and beard grow long, wears loose clothing, low-necked shirts and no collar or hatter at all, out-Byrons Byron, and if he can do all this, as Whitman does, and still maintain his self-respect, and not get hooted at on every street corner, that is, keep on his own way without fastening upon himself the obloquy of a quack and charlatan, it argues pretty strongly that there is unusual stuff in the animal somewhere. And the man who can name three hundred little songs and songlets, and somehow permeate each name with instinctive life that laughs at commonplace and each name an original fixed streak of genius in its way, not only not dull, but vividly descriptive, suggestive, is something out of the ordinary ranks of hacks in all lines. As to the poems, Emerson long ago said they were poetry; Tennyson, Swinburne, not to speak of vapid critics at home or abroad, affirm that Walt has written poetry. What is there left to be said? Much every day were there room to say it. Short and clear let the words be. It would be easy to pick a thousand lines from Whitman's three hundred and eighty-two pages that fairly breathe and bristle with power, that sparkle and flash with beauty, that are as unique in modern poetry as the brightest aurora that has filled the north skies for a generation and as rare as the few gem-like days of June. Now and then there are eclipses; sunlight and stars all gone out of the man and his word; but nature swings back to him, lo to it, and there is light again when the orbit is bound and nature attuned. It is life, seen and recorded. Never mind the egotism. That must come in somehow in all work. To jot it down more definitely, Whitman has eyes, looks into things, not at them. No long or steady gaze, no masterful comprehension of the great laws of the facts, but the facts he sees; furthermore, has the ability to report the fact as he sees it, as it is; yet further, to saturate all facts so seen and recorded with the momentary intense splendor of his own being. Name the being? The grade of it? Well, not Homeric; that was warlike, heroic, grand. Read the lines of Whitman's face and of his poetry: nothing of the Homeric or heroic is there. Not Shakespearean; that is art incarnate. Whitman is not an artist; not Virgilic or Dantic\u2014that is culture and morality and sentiment and piety of a kind. Whitman has none of these. Not Emersonian or Tennysonian\u2014that is scholarly\u2014Whitman is the farthest removed from all that. What then? We answer, that what these all were to the distinctive spirit of their generations, though in utter contrast with them, Whitman is to the characteristic spirit of this generation\u2014gigantic, rude, loud, prosy, mechanic, conceited. Whirling, unsettled, abounding in vitality, extent and power. In this light read Whitman's book, and lines fine, in their way, as any in Homer or Shakespeare shall flash on your soul, if you have a soul, and pleasure rich and rare as the lover finds in love, the poet in nature, and the banker in his margins shall press and pierce you almost to pain.</p>", "date": "December 3 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Philadelphia Times", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1881\u201382)].\" 3 December 1881.

The struggle has raged fiercely about every point, from the question whether the term 'poem' can properly be applied to these odd recitatives at all, to the question of their meaning and their inspiration. The complete works of Walt Whitman are now put into the hands of the old generation and the new, to do what work they may; but by this time criticism should have crystallized into something definite, and the world ought not longer to go on wondering, each man scanning the face of his neighbor before venturing upon an opinion of his own. And first, let the old quarrel about the form of these poems be finally dismissed. The question of the fittest form for the expression of poetic ideas is as old as human thought, and different ages and nations have answered it differently. The modern rules of rhyme and accent would have seemed senseless to the Latin or Greek prosodists. All these matters are mere conventionalities; and if a man's genius direct him to write in measures hitherto unknown, why let him be judged independently of what are little more than the literary fashions of the day. Whitman's chants strike rudely on the ear at first; but there is in their very construction an element of the magnificent old Hebrew rhythm which marks the book of Job the grandest of epics. They are not mere accidental jumbles. The reader with an ear for music will detect a theme running through them all, which will satisfy him as well, if he be a thoughtful man, as if he could scan them glibly by anapests or trochees. That Whitman is a great poet, it does not require a long reading to discover. From this volume could be collected more absolutely fresh instances of that creative genius which is the progenitor of poetry than from any writer of modern times. Metaphors of singular fidelity and beauty, such as 'the fan-shaped explosions,' crowd upon and round out the lines. Who that has ever heard it can forget this one?\u2014'The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp.' Many of his short poems are as clean-cut as crystals, and as melodious as more strictly measured cadences. The 'Drum Taps' are famous everywhere; and, though later efforts have been less happy, the one exquisite song, 'O, Captain! My Captain!' written on the death of Lincoln, would make him one of our honored poets forever. When mere formal objections are laid by, the most obvious surface criticism upon Whitman is his apparent egotism. It is everywhere 'I,' 'me imperturbe,' 'I project the history of the future,' 'You do not understand me, you cannot understand me, but I can wait hundreds of years for my audience, and they will understand and applaud me.' If these were merely the mouthings of individual pride, they would inspire deserved disgust. But they are the words of a man who has a message and proves it. Everywhere, to him who reads aright, the personality of the prophet is sunk out of sight, and the prophecy is exalted. This man feels that he has a message to the multitudinous generations. The grandeur of humanity, the oneness of creation, the beauty and the glory in that one word, 'life,' the meanness of social and artificial distinctions, the grand eternal sweep of cosmic laws, the dignity of everything that is, simply because it is, and the onward march of all things mean and great toward a wondrous destiny,\u2014these are the high thoughts which reduce language almost to incoherence, and fill the seer with unutterable exaltation. Is not this the true humility of one who thinks much of his message and little of himself?\u2014</p><p>The words of my book nothing, the drift of it <br>everything. <br>A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt <br>by the intellect, <br>But you ye untold latencies, will thrill to every <br>page.</p><p>His sympathy with everything in nature bea[rs] marks of that higher pantheism to which modern scientific and religious thought distinctly tend. His sinking of self, in the midst of seeming self-glorification, is the poet's tribute to the race. His apparently intuitive grasp of truth toward which knowledge laboriously gropes, has been firmly shown by Professor Clifford in his essay on 'Cosmic Emotion.' The wonderful new light that shines to-day upon poems written twenty years ago and since unchanged, but then unintelligible, is a better vindication of the inspiration behind them than all the work of critics and reviewers. Does any man claim that Whitman is weakly atheistic?</p><p>I say no man has ever yet been half devout <br>enough,<br>None has every yet adored or worship'd half <br>enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself <br>is, and how certain the future is.<br>All the things of the universe are perfect mir-<br>acles, each as profound as any.<br>The wonder is always and always how there can <br>be a mean man or an infidel.</p><p>He is religious enough, though not with the faith of the creeds. 'Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation.' He looks through nature to ultimate forces and exults in them.</p><p>And as to you Death, and you bitter tug of mortal-<br>ity, it is idle to try to alarm me.<br>And as to you Life, I reason you are the leavings of <br>many deaths.<br>I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,<br>O suns\u2014O grass of graves\u2014O perpetual transfers <br>and promotions.</p><p>He is, indeed a poet who sees far and keenly; and no doubt the reader of the future will believe it still more than we. One other current objection must be briefly met. Public and publishers have cried out upon his indecency. It is true that there are in this book things which no man observant of conventions would have dared to print. But it must be said of them, as he says of his poems, that the words are nothing, the tendency everything. His lines are bold and startling, but you can look them through and through and find no prurient suggestiveness. His aim is to glorify human nature as God made it, with powers complete but undefiled. Delicate modesty feeds upon Swinburne, but flees with down-drawn eyelids from Whitman; yet the pages of the latter are to those of the former what a gallery of Greek sculpture, filled with noble, life-like, marble figures, is to the cancan upon the stage of the Paris Varieties. The real, consistent criticisms upon Leaves of Grass have been uttered, if at all, but by few and with hesitation. Whitman seems to have in undue amount the author's tenderness, born perhaps, in this case, of his sense of the greatness of his mission, for every word he has written; and this has prevented the exclusion of worthless matter. The few lines, for instance, entitled The Ship Starting, contain neither thought nor figure of beauty that entitle them to life. And in his longer poems the tiresome enumerations of States, countries and avocations, which sometimes spread over pages, are but the wanderings of heated imagination and vivid fancy, detracting from both the inner thought and the outer artistic effect. To cut down the volume probably one-fourth, if judiciously done, would exclude nothing of present or possible future value. The constant use of such words as 'ostent,' 'sidle,' 'sluing,' and the like, is bad English and worse taste. Again, he is open to the charge of making his thought unnecessarily obscure. Doubtless he himself cannot grasp in their fullness all the mighty ideas which float illusively before him. He is like a child attempting to describe Niagara, or like him who could not utter a word of the things he saw and heard, when caught up to heaven in a vision. But he is, nevertheless, unnecessarily mystic and incoherent. Those who have penetrated to the heart of one of his Delphic sayings can see that its intent was purposely shrouded in vague, verbal involutions. Not only might he have sooner won his place, but he might have done better the work in which he glories, had he courted the strong simplicity which none is better able to master. Leaves of Grass has won its own way, and is sure of its place. Few American authors have the reputation abroad which Whitman has attained. At home he is destined to a closer and more admiring study as the years go by. From such a discipline it is not impossible that a greater future poet may draw virility and inspiration, while avoiding errors which impair the strength and the popular influence of a work unique, original, careless of standards and traditions, yet replete with beauty and power.</p>", "date": "December 12 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Saint Paul and Minneapolis Pioneer Press", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Leaves of Grass.\" 12 December 1881.

It cannot be said of them, as Sir Charles Pomander, in 'Christie Johnstone,' says of his broken statues, that 'time has impaired their indelicacy.' This somewhat nauseating quality remains in full force, and we see no good in their publication except to abate the outcries of the Liberal League against Mr. Anthony Comstock and his laws respecting obscene publications. So long as Leaves of Grass may be sent through the mails, the country is safe from over-prudery, at least. Mr. Whitman is often ranked with the 'fleshly school,' and his circle of English admirers is almost identical with the coterie whose apostles are Swinburne and Wilde. But the erotic poems of these authors are to those of Whitman as rose-water to vitriol. The English poets have at their worst some thin veneering of personal emotion; with Whitman there seems no gleam of anything personal, much less of that simple, generous impulse which makes almost every young man throw some halo of ideal charm about the object of his adoration. Whitman's love, if such it can be called, is the sheer animal longing of sex for sex\u2014the impulse of the savage, who knocks down the first woman he sees, and drags her to his cave. On the whole, the condition of the savage seems the more wholesome, for he simply gratifies his brute lust and writes no resounding lines about it. </p><p>Leaving this disagreeable aspect of the matter, we are impressed anew, on reading these poems, by a certain quality of hollowness, which is nowhere more felt than in the strains called 'Drum-Taps.' It would be scarcely worth while to bring these strains to any personal test, perhaps, did not Mr. Whitman's admirers so constantly intrude his personality upon us; but we cannot quite forget what Emerson says, that 'it makes a great difference to a sentence whether there be a man behind it or no.' When Mr. Whitman speaks with utter contempt of the 'civilian' (p. 252), and claps the soldier on the back as 'camerado' (p. 251), we cannot help thinking of Thackeray's burly and peaceful Jos. Sedley at Brussels, just before the battle of Waterloo, striding and swaggering between two military officers, and looking far more warlike than either. One can be aroused to some enthusiasm over the pallid shop-boy or the bookish undergraduate who knew no better than to shoulder his musket and march to the front in the war for the Union; but it is difficult to awaken any such emotion for a stalwart poet, who\u2014with the finest physique in America, as his friends asserted, and claiming an unbounded influence over the 'roughs' of New York\u2014preferred to pass by the recruiting-office and take service in the hospital with the non-combatants.</p><p>When we come to purely intellectual traits, it is a curious fact that Mr. Whitman, by the production of one fine poem, has overthrown his whole poetic theory. Dozens of pages of his rhythmic prose are not worth 'My Captain,' which among all his compositions comes the nearest to accepting the restraints of ordinary rhyme. His success in this shows that he too may yet be compelled to recognize form as an element in poetic power. The discovery may have come too late, but unless he can regard its lessons he is likely to leave scarcely a complete work that will be remembered; only here and there a phrase, an epithet, a fine note\u2014as when the midnight tolling for General Garfield is called 'The sobbing of the bells.' These are the passages which his especial admirers style 'Homeric,' but which we should rather call Ossianic. The shadowy Gaelic bard rejected the restraints of verse, like Whitman, and reiterated his peculiar images with wearisome diffuseness and minuteness. To be sure, he was not an egotist, and he kept within the limits of decency; but he gave fine glimpses and pictures, while there was always a certain large, free atmosphere about all his works. They were translated into all languages; he was ranked with Homer and Virgil; Goethe and Napoleon Bonaparte were his warm admirers\u2014and the collections of English poetry do not now include a line of his composing. If Whitman, after the same length of time, proves more fortunate, it will be because he wrote 'My Captain.'</p><p>Extremes meet, and many of Mr. Whitman's admirers are also enamored of the peculiarly hot-house atmosphere of Mr. Rossetti. We may be mistaken, but we see in his new volume a healthier strain than before, both in the sonnets added and in the subtraction of others.

But twenty years have wrought a mighty change. Whitman has steadily grown in favor in Europe and hence his own countrymen have taken him up and have gradually come to see that a great and original poet has been among them.</p><p>James R. Osgood & Co., of Boston, have just issued a volume of 382 pages containing Whitman's complete works. It is now discovered that from the beginning the poet had a purpose to which he has steadily adhered; that for thirty years he has been laboring on a great work with one aim, and that what seemed fragmentary were the parts of a great whole, the segments of a mighty circle, which the purblind public could not see or comprehend at one view.</p><p>The Pioneer Press a few days ago noticed these poems in a column article, doing justice to the poems and the poet. From England and America we expect to hear a reversal of the judgment of the flippant and shallow critics of twenty years ago and henceforth Walt Whitman will take a permanent place in history as the father and founder of a distinctively American literature.</p><p>We rejoice at this, for we were among those who first hailed Whitman as a poetic star of great magnitude rising over the horizon. In the year 1860, we published a literary paper called 'The Fireside,' in which we devoted a page to Whitman, quoting from the Westminster Review an adverse criticism and taking issue with the shallow reviewer. The British review thus spoke of the poems:</p><p>In form these poems, if poems they can be called, are composed of irregular rhythmical lines, after the manner of Tupper, and in fact they may be described by the following equation: as Tupper is to English Humdrum, so is Walt Whitman to American Rowdy.</p><p>That a drunken Helot should display himself without shame in the market place, speaks sad reproach to the public that does not scourge him back to his cellar.</p><p>To this the Cincinnati Commercial added:</p><p>This is deserved, and yet there are dirty dogs and dunces who praise Whitman's indecency, and call him a 'masculine poet' because he is an obscure ass.</p><p>In reply to this we said twenty-one years ago, page 106 of the 'Fireside':</p><p>Nevertheless, Walt Whitman is a poet. We expected better things of the Westminster Review. The above is of that shallow kind of criticism which flounders about on the surface and cannot reach down and feel the drift and great undercurrent of a work. Whitman is as much a word-painter as Bryant and a great deal more original, simple and masculine. No writer has ever given such a complete and natural picture of the external life of America. The man who is too much shocked by its 'indecency' to find any beauty in 'Leaves of Grass,' must have a very tasty taste. Whitman is a poet, but a poet rather in the rough.</p><p>We envy Mr. Conway, of the 'Dial,' his remark, viz: 'Walt Whitman has set the pulses of America to music.' There is more justness and appreciation, and comprehensive criticism in that short sentence than in all the conservative critics have said about Whitman.</p><p>We well remember how the 'thothiety' editors and the smart youths whose conception of poetry extended only to 'Marco Bozzaris' and 'Hohenlinden' jeered at these poems! How they referred to the poet himself as a product of the 'Brooklyn Flats' and as the 'red-shirted omnibus driver' of the metropolis. Yet Walt Whitman has made a profound impression on his time. And while he will probably not be generally read any more than Chaucer is. Yet the time will come when Whitman will be looked upon as the father of an American literature, that is of a literature distinctively and in all respects American, without any kingly, or monarchical or European influences in it.\u2014He has laid the foundations, started the idea, of a genuine Democratic, New World, thoroughly American literature, and after him will come some great poet who will be the Shakspeare to this Chaucer. Moreover he is a genuine American man, the most original and truest Democrat of his time. The man is greater than his poems. His works, as the expression of a thoroughly original, democratic, human being, are invaluable, and on this foundation some mighty genius hereafter will build a literature and the gates of hell and time shall not prevail against it. Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier, Lowell and the rest will be remembered in the Cyclopedias as poets who did creditable work in English literature, but Whitman and his class will loom over the future as the founders and makers of an American literature.</p>", "date": "December 22 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Worthington Advance", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"The First American Poet.\" 22 December 1881.

Osgood & Co. </p><p>The prophet, of whom it was once said that he was not without honor except in his own country, has now, if not a circle of disciples, certainly a large and increasing audience of admirers. Several magazines and newspapers, which either received the words of 'the Good Gray Poet' with abuse, or refused to allow their pages to be sullied with a notice of his 'monstrosities,' now welcome his life-work with little short of unstinted praise. Nor is this due to the fact that a great publishing house gives its imprint to the title page. The reason lies deeper. While upon some natures his name still has the effect of the traditional red rag upon the angry bull, the majority of cultivated minds begin to see that Walt Whitman is the most American of poets and one of the brightest lights of American literature. It is worth while, then, for even very briefly to examine some of the adverse criticisms that have been passed upon Mr. Whitman, and to see how much weight they really have.</p><p>First, it is said that the form into which he throws his verse is chaotic, that his poems run to 'a chaos of monotonies,' and hence his book makes war upon all theories of true poetry. The same criticism would shut out of the category the English Psalms of David, and the best and most satisfactory translations of Homer and the Greek dramatists, Virgil and Dante, Goethe and Victor Hugo. These authors are still poets in the most literal translation, and the man who can read Whitman and find no rhythm lacks a musical ear. He has the most astounding variety of meters suited to every slightest change of sentiment, here lilting like a smooth flowing river, here carrying the reader along with all the rush of a Niagara, and again blocking itself with wonderful expressiveness. A study of Whitman's meters would be no more interesting and instructive than that which is spent on the complicated, and to us moderns the meaningless, systems of the Greek strophe and antistrophe. Take these four lines from 'A Broadway Pageant.' They are worthy of Horace:</p><p>'Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,<br>Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,<br>Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, <br>impassive,<br>Ride to-day through Manhattan.'</p><p>And hundreds of other instances could be given. Again, it is said that the catalogues with which Walt Whitman loads his poems are unpoetical. Without attempting to argue the point it may be said that were all records of America destroyed and Walt Whitman's poems preserved, the daily life of the nineteenth century might be pictured with almost photographic accuracy from the same much-abused catalogues; and, moreover, if anyone reads them understandingly he will not fail to be impressed with their picturesqueness and contrast their felicity of descriptiveness, and, taken in connection with the plan of the whole work, their appropriateness. And this brings us to a third adverse criticism: That the work has no unity of plan. To a narrow conception this is true. It needs a wide perspective, and, if these poems had been left to us by an ancient bard, they would have been prized as the most precious memorial of the past. The old story of the sculptor is not inapplicable here. Seen from a level at a short distance the statue appeared monstrous and coarse; but when erected upon its proper height, the rude lines melted into softness and the coarse features were seen to be simply majestic. His boldness of touch is admirable; his pages are veritable panoramas of life; his observation is all-embracing; nothing fails in the picture, and he is equally at home on the wide plains of the West, the wind-swept 'gray beach' of the Paumanok shore, or amid the eddying swarms of the city. His adjectives are often worthy of Homer, and his view of the universe wider than Goethe's. </p><p>A common charge against Mr. Whitman, is that of his overweening vanity. It must be admitted that if his every utterance be taken as the expression of his personal individual feeling, vanity could not go further; it would be the acme of conceit. But this again is a narrow view. Mr. Whitman symbolizes himself in the grandeur, the spread, the vast liberty of the man. It is the ideal of self-conscious Pantheism. 'The Song of Myself,' is not Walt Whitman in any small way. Myself is man idealized, and every pleasure, every passion, every pain which goes to make up the life of the world, is centred upon him as a sentient being capable of all things. Looked upon ideally, therefore, there is no conceit in it; aside from its form, it is the grandest conception of poetry which this century has given, and, if read without prejudice, cannot fail to stir the heart. The egotism is the egotism of the poet, and may be seen in these lines from the greatest of the Welsh bards, which bear a curious similarity in form to Mr. Whitman's poems, though possessing individuality of their own:</p><p>'Primary chief bard am I to Elphin,<br>And my original country is the region of the Sum-<br>mer Stars.<br>I was with my Lord in the highest sphere,<br>On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell;<br>I have borne a banner before Alexander;<br>I know the names of the stars from North to South;<br>I have been on the Milky Way at the throne of the <br>Distributor;<br>I have been winged by the genius of the splendid <br>crozier;<br>I have been loquacious prior to being gifted with<br>speech;<br>I am a wonder whose origin is not known;<br>I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark;<br>I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra;<br>I have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass;<br>I have been in the armament with Mary Magda-<br>lene;<br>I have suffered hunger for the Son of the Virgin;<br>I have been fostered in the land of the Deity;<br>I am teacher to all intelligences;<br>I am able to instruct the whole universe;<br>I shall be until the day of doom on the face of the <br>earth;<br>And it is not known whether my body is flesh or <br>fish.'</p><p>And it is said that when Taliesin had finished his song, the kings who heard it were filled with marvel. </p><p>A still further objection, and the most serious one which has been urged against Mr. Whitman, is on the score of morality. It is claimed that he sins against purity, that he is the poet of the phallus and unbridled lust and indecency. Such a charge is extravagant. The lines which could be condemned on such a plea bear but a small proportion to the rest, and it may be said in defense that were its immodesty to shut it out from libraries, the Bible, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, and most of the master-pieces of literature would have to suffer in the same way. Again, it was not written for babes and sucklings, and the person who can get food for vile imaginings from it would be fed equally from a thousand other sources; honi soit qui mal y pense. It can hurt no true man or woman. As regards the question of taste, the chemical view of matter which can reduce a vile and a pleasant odor, rot and sweet, smut and diamond-dust to the same elements is not the most conducive to poetry, and here it seems as though Mr. Whitman failed. Granting his premises that 'If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,' still personal preferences, the love of the beautiful, the true, the high, the noble, the best that is meant in the word 'taste,' is also a part of human nature and therefore superior to the excremental, the disagreeably physical view of man. Mr. Whitman might have consistently taken this ground and raised his poems immeasurably in the eyes of the world which he claims to love, by expunging a few expressions which cannot fail to offend the taste of the reader. Some think it a greater sin to break the laws of good taste than those of morality. Moreover, it is a question whether the attempt to carry out his colossal plan of depicting humanity in its every phase is worth while, since it places his most stimulating, most inspired and grandest utterances out of the kin of the very boys and girls who are growing up into the future men and women, which his verse exalts. We believe in an expurgated Bible, an expurgated Shakespeare and an expurgated Whitman, at least for the use of the young. The question of Mr. Whitman's sins against the English language is of less consequence. Good taste would alter a few; others which make the critics howl are legitimate if North and South, East and West and the [sic] all the French, German, Spanish elements of our country be taken [into] consideration.</p><p>We have assumed all along that Mr. Whitman is a poet. Some critics deny this, but we venture to say that had Leaves of Grass come down to us from antiquity, it would be the universal claim that they had the sweep and magnificence of the epic and the variety and expression of the lyric. There are poems in 'Drum Taps' which stir the heart like a bugle:</p><p>'Beat! beat! drums!\u2014blow! bugles! blow.<br>Through the windows, through doors, burst like a <br>ruthless force,<br>Into the solemn church and scatter the congrega-<br>tion,<br>Into the school where the scholar is studying;<br>Leave not the bridegroom quiet\u2014no happine[ss]<br>must he have with his bride,<br>Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing [his] <br>field or gathering his grain,<br>So fierce you whirr and pound yon drum\u2014so sh[gap] <br>yon bugles blow.'</p><p>King David would not have been ashamed [of] this psalm:</p><p>'Proud music of the storm,<br>Blast that careers so fine, whistling among the [gap] <br>ries,<br>Strong hum of forest tree-tops\u2014wind of the [moun-] <br>tains,<br>Personified dim shapes\u2014you hidden [gap]<br>You serenades of phantoms with instru[gap]<br>Blinding with Nature's rhythmus all th[gap] <br>nations;<br>You chords left as by vast composers [gap]<br>You formless, tree, religious dan[gap] <br>Orient,<br>You undertone of rivers, roar of [gap]<br>You sounds from distant [gap] <br>Cavalry.<br>Echoes of camps, with all th[gap]<br>Trooping tumultuous, all[gap] <br>bending me powerless[gap]<br>Entering my lonesome [gap] <br>You seized me?'</p><p>Without even [gap] any definite way [gap] hesitate to place [gap] 'though you are.' Some of Whitman's readers have fancied that of late he would have been glad to omit some of the Adamic verse but for pride; and have in fact felt as if his theory of poetry might be the in some measure invented to fit the facts and justify them, rather than have been the source and mold of them. As good a thing as has ever been said of Whitman's work in this direction is contained in a review in a previous number of the Critic. Speaking of the old 'dilettante atmosphere' of our literature, without vital connection with the life of the country, the reviewer says\u2014</p><p>'Into this hot-house air of literature Walt Whitman bounded, with the vigor and suppleness of a clown at a funeral. Dire were the grimaces of the mourners in high places, and dire are their grimaces still. There were plenty of criticisms to make, even after one had finished crying Oh! at the frank sensuality, the unbelievable nakedness of Walt. Everything that decent folk covered up, Walt exhibited, and boasted of exhibiting! He was proud of his nakedness and sensuality. He cried, Look here, you pampered rogues of literature, what are you squirming about, when you know, and everybody knows, that things are just like this, always have been, always will be? But it must be remembered that this is what he wrote, and that he did it with a plan, and by order from his genius. It has never been heard of him that he was disgusting in talk or vile in private life, while it has been known that poets celebrated for the lofty tone of their morality, for the strictness of their Christianity, the purity of their cabinet hymns, can condescend in private life to wallow in all that is base.'</p><p>Well worth quoting, before we leave the two great Americans, is what Walt says of Emerson: 'Amid the utter delirium-disease called bookmaking, its feverish cohorts filling our world with every form of dislocation, morbidity, and special type of anemia or exceptionalism (with the propelling idea of getting the most possible money, first of all), how comforting to know of an author who has, through a long life, and in spirit, written as honestly, spontaneously and innocently as the sun shines or the wheat grows\u2014the truest, sanest, most moral, sweetest literary man on record\u2014unsoiled by pecuniary or any other warp\u2014ever teaching the law within\u2014ever loyally outcropping his own self only\u2014his own poetic and devout soul!'</p>", "date": "December 23 1881", "year": 1881, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Philadelphia Press", "citation": " [Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1881\u201382)].\" 23 December 1881.

As usual in such cases, the reaction increased the demand for the book to such an extent that several new editions have been called for and it is found on the shelves of book stores side by side with Longfellow and Tennyson, in the home and in public libraries, where the critical reader or student of verse can have access to it, and the human nature that can suffer from any undue license of the poetic imagination which Walt Whitman has transcribed on these pages must be very weak indeed and easily harmed.</p><p>There is not a line of prefatory writing in Leaves of Grass, not a foot note to clear up the passages in nature which God has left obscure; the writer does not explain that the poems were a result of a few idle hours or the reveries of an invalid convalescing from an attack of mania a potu or typhoid fever; he pours out his thoughts about everything in a flood of incoherent and incohesive language, and borne on its resistless flow we find all that floods bear with them, debris, flotsam jewels\u2014tarns of still deep beauty jewels\u2014precious, perishing lovely things that we haste to snatch from the rubbish and make our own. His interest in humanity and his claim that all the world is kin, he expresses with natural humility:</p><p>These are really the thoughts of all men in all <br>ages and lands, they are not original with me;<br>If they are not yours as much as mine they are <br>nothing or next to nothing;<br>If they are the riddle and the untying of the <br>riddle, they are nothing or next to nothing;<br>This is the grass that grows wherever the land is <br>and the water is;<br>This is the common air that bathes the globe.</p><p>Can any pen-picture of nature be finer than his apostrophe to the earth on page 76? </p><p>'Smile O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunsets\u2014earth of the mount-<br>ains misty top!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbowed earth\u2014rich apple-blos- <br>somed earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.<br>Prodigal, you have given me love\u2014therefore I to <br>you give love.<br>O unspeakable passionate love!</p><p>There seems to be no earthly property however small, insignificant and remote, that this grand poet of nature does not invest with the beauty and glory of poesy as he does when he calls the common field grass 'the beautiful uncut hair of graves,' a line that in itself should immortalize him; he walks among the herds of cattle and gives us this lesson:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they <br>are so placid and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them long and long;<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condi-<br>tion;<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and whine <br>about their sins;<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty <br>to God.<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with <br>the mania of owning things.<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that <br>lived thousands of years ago;<br>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the <br>whole earth.'</p><p>The self-elected critic who said that Shakespeare was not a poet\u2014his verses didn't rhyme\u2014would make a similar objection to Walt Whitman. To the dull, untuned ear of the prosaic soul they would convey neither rhythm nor rhyme, but Poetry herself might sit entranced at his feet as the mellow numbers flow in tranquil rhythmic measure from his lips. Here are snatches selected at random, any one of which would be sufficient to redeem a volume from wastage:</p><p>The old face of the mother of many children, <br>Whist! I am fully content.</p><p>Behold a woman:<br>She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is <br>clearer and more beautiful than the sky.</p><p>She sits in an arm-chair under the shaded porch <br>of the farm-house.</p><p>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen.<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-<br>daughters spun it with the distaff and the <br>wheel.</p><p>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go <br>and does not wish to go.</p><p>The justified mother of men.</p><p><em>MOTHER AND BABE.</em><br>I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of <br>its mother,<br>The sleeping mother and babe\u2014hush'd, I study <br>them long.</p><p><em>A CHILD'S AMAZE.</em><br>Silent and amazed, even when a little boy,<br>I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday <br>put God in his statements<br>As contending against some being or influence.</p><p><em>BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.</em><br>Women sit, or move to and fro\u2014some old, <br>some young.<br>The young are beautiful; but the old are more <br>beautiful than the young.</p><p>The poet's allusions to death are among the finest passages in his works, and his songs of parting are something more than tricks of pathos; they are the outcome of sorrow's cleansing fires in his own heart. The Camps of Green is a poem engendered by war scenes.</p><p>'To the camps of the tents of green,<br>Which the days of peace kept filling, <br>And the days of war kept filling.<br>With a mystic army; is it too ordered<br>Forward? is it too only halting awhile,<br>Till night and sleep pass over?</p><p><em>JOY, SHIPMATE, JOY!</em><br>Joy, shipmate, joy.<br>Pleased to my soul at death I cry<br>Our life is closed, our life begins<br>The long, long anchorage we leave;<br>The ship is clear at last she leaps,<br>She swiftly courses from the shore<br>Joy, shipmate, joy.</p><p>The exquisitely mournful tribute to the memory of President Lincoln is familiar [to] the reader but it will bear producing here.</p><p><em>O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN!</em><br>O Captain, my Captain! our fearful trip is done<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we <br>sought is won<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel <br>grim and daring;</p><p>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain, my Captain, rise up and hear the bells.<br>Rise up\u2014for you the flag is flung\u2014for you the <br>bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths\u2014for you <br>the shore a crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning.</p><p>Here Captain, dear father<br>This arm beneath your head<br>Is it some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead?</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale <br>and still<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will<br>The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage <br>closed and done<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won.</p><p>Exult O shores, and ring O bells,<br>But I with mournful tread<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>To analyze a flower is to kill it; the same might be said of the majority of even fine poems, but there are some that dissected fall into pictures and the above is one of these; the two lines</p><p>'Here, captain, dear father,<br>This arm beneath your head'</p><p>have the heroism of a soldier and the tenderness of a woman in them, while they instantly convey to the mind a picture, alas! too common to excite alarm or wonder, but inexpressively touching. It has been Walt Whitman's destiny to commemorate in verse the deaths of two captains of the ship of state, but to him the first was a personal loss.

It would need one of Emersonian breadth to appreciate the vigor, the intensity, the strong balancing of all mental and physical forces in this redundancy of verse. The book is full of such salt-sea breezes of expression as these:</p><p>O the joy of a manly selfhood!<br>To be servile to none to defer to none, not to any <br>tyrant known or unknown;<br>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy <br>and elastic;<br>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye;<br>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a <br>broad chest;<br>To confront with your personality all the other <br>personalities of the earth.'</p><p>That verse or sentence alone could be profitably engraved upon the pages of every school reader in the land, yet doubtless there are hypercritical readers who would cavil at the second line and find in it a furtive attack on all the known systems of theology.</p><p>And is there nothing in the book to condemn? Yes, there are whole pages of 'magnificent uncleanness' which have no excuse for being. They are gross with the grossness of the 18th century, when people do not call a spade a spade, and are shocked by ungloved hands. In reference to the position which a part of the public has taken towards the book we are reminded of the answer Henry Ward Beecher gave to a gentleman who at an exhibition of statuary asked, 'Are those statues indecent, Mr. Beecher?'</p><p>'No, sir,' was the severe answer, 'but your question is.'</p><p>The poet is an old man now, the fires of youth have burned themselves to ashes, yet when he was called upon to revise the present edition of his work he would not alter or omit a line of his earlier writings.

Osgood & Co., of Boston, concluded to bring out a revised and enlarged edition of WALT WHITMAN's 'Leaves of Grass,' they did the best thing possible for American literature, and performed an act of justice towards the most thoroughly original of American bards. WALT WHITMAN is in himself\u2014and in his book, which is himself\u2014the soul of the new and generous continent. He has its asserting egotism, its crude force, its prolific and bounteous vitality. He has the abounding hospitality, the inspiriting positivism of a people that have girdled the forests and chained the mountains and linked to the respectable traditions of a dead past the vital energies of the living present, and who see in the future they shall conquer, the fulfillment of their dearest prophecies and their divinest expectations.</p><p>Reading carefully the nearly three hundred pages of 'Leaves of Grass' the student, both of literature and of humanity, can but wonder at the strange power that manifests itself in every paragraph. They may criticise the form of expression, may question the taste of certain passages, but the overlying grace of the poet and the underlying spirit of the philanthropist animate every part. Here is the vigor and splendor that have called forth the admiration of an EMERSON, a LONGFELLOW and a TENNYSON. It is the largeness and vitality of the primal man\u2014the gigantic and multiplied possibilities of a continent of vast lakes and praries, and rivers and mountains and far-reaching, fertile plains. The effeminate and hot-house reader has no need of its pages. As well could he exchange his satin-covered and rose-scented couch for a bed among the pine boughs of the Sierras. Its living imagery and masterly action is to them both coarse and crude. This Elijah in the wilderness, with his coarse vesture and fiery self-assertion, is quite as much an object of scorn to the dainty esthetes as was the old prophet to the college boys who shouted, 'Go up thou bald head!' But the new bard is a prophet too, and as such is willing to wait the slow appreciation that comes to the forerunner in any line. Nearing the conclusion of his volume he says:\u2014</p><p>'When America does what was promised,<br>When through these States walk a hund-<br>red millions of superb persons,<br>When the rest part away for superb per-<br>sons and contribute to them,<br>When breeds of the most perfect mothers <br>denote America,<br>Then to me and mine our due fruition.'</p><p.WALT WHITMAN is the poet of democracy, of strict and absolute equality, who exalts woman alike with man. He is the poet of powerful figures, and there is nothing outside of HOMER and the Bible that equals the splendor of his imagery or the elevation of an occasional passage. The thirty-six pages of military verse under the heading 'Drum Taps' contain matchless descriptions of scenes of camp and battle, unequalled by those of any modern writer. 'Autumn Rivulets' and 'From Noon to Starry Night' are full of indescribable flights. Quoting from the closing poem again, 'So Long,' the poet prophesies of what shall come after him:</p><p>'I announce natural persons to rise,<br>I announce justice triumphant,<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and <br>equality,<br>I announce the justification of candor and <br>the justification of pride.</p><p>I announce a life copious, vehement, <br>spiritual, bold,<br>I announce the end that shall lightly and <br>joyfully meet its translation.'</p><p>After all that has been written it is scarcely necessary for us to add that while there are passages in 'Leaves of Grass' that for the sake of the immature and casual reader we would gladly obliterate, yet as a sign of the time when a distinctively American school of literature shall arise, vigorous, wholesome, pure, breezy as the praries and lofty as the Sierras, we welcome WALT WHITMAN and his book. It is a splendid protest against the fine spun and sickly effeminacy of the AMANDA MATILDA poetry of the American magazine. It is very strong meat but good for vigorous digestion. 'Camerado,' we return your kiss. Though 'disembodied, triumphant, dead,' you will dwell forever in the epic of democracy.</p>", "date": "January 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Toledo Journal", "citation": " [Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman's Poems.\" January 1882.

Detroit: Thorndike Nourse. </p><p>That Walt Whitman is genuine and thoroughly believes in himself is beyond question. It does not therefore follow that he is a poet, though we have noticed that those who insist most strenuously upon his claim to be so considered, base the claim mainly on his genuineness and self-confidence, waiving for the moment all discussion as to the beastliness of certain of his verses\u2014there really is no other word which fitly characterizes them\u2014his poems, so-called, very rarely furnish any excuse for their appearance in the poetic form. There is no rhyme or pretense of any, nor is there any attempt at meter. With one or two exceptions they might just as well be written like other prose.</p><p>Of course this does not settle the question. There is a great deal of poetry in the English language without either rhyme or meter. But it is recognized as such in spite of the prosaic form; while Walt Whitman's ebullitions, if put in that form, would not be. Printed as prose they would strike the reader as grandiloquent, sonorous, rhetorical, sometimes as imaginative, almost always as egotistical, but very rarely as poetical. Take, for example, such a verse as the following, strike out the misplaced capitals and the spaces, in short, print it as prose is printed, and see how much of the 'divine afflatus' can be detected in it:</p><p>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by <br>road, lo, such faces!<br>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, <br>ideality,<br>The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome <br>common benevolent face.<br>The face of the singing of music,the grand faces <br>of natural lawyers and judges, broad at the <br>back-top.<br>The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the <br>brows, the shaved,blanched faces of ortho-<br>dox citizens.<br>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning <br>artist's face.<br>The ugly face of some beautiful soul,the hand-<br>some, detested or despised face.</p><p>This now is too lamentable a face for a man.<br>Some abject louse asking leave to be,cringing for <br>it,<br>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig <br>to its hole.</p><p>As for the beastly portion of the volume,'The Children of Adam,' it is an outrage upon the decencies of literature. It is open, undisguised sensualism of the grossest sort; and its publication is a grave mistake. We have no special fear that it will corrupt the rising generation, for its indecency is so potent that intelligent parents and guardians will look out for it. But when such a work, with the imprint of a highly respected publishing house, has free circulation and transmission through the mails, an argument almost unanswerable is furnished for the professional perverters of youth whose vile trash, heretofore excluded from the mails, is really less indecorous in form\u2014whatever it may be in spirit\u2014than some portions of 'Leaves of Grass.'</p>", "date": "January 7 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Detroit Free Press", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1881\u201382)].\" 7 January 1882.

It is intended to be the author's full expression to date, and we trust that it is. The book has nearly four hundred pages of close print. The conscientious reading of it and every page of it in the hope that the next line might be different, has consumed two rainy days of leisure. For such time and patience Walt Whitman owes to each reader an unpayable debt.</p><p>The subject of the book is the Body, the Soul, the Sexes, Democracy, New York with its Firemen and Ferries, the Civil War, Lincoln and America\u2014all as revolving in their orbits around Walt Whitman, and cheered in their courses by the sound of what he felicitously calls his 'barbaric yawp.' He holds himself out as the exemplar of a fuller outer and inner life, whom and which no one can hope to understand from his book, or in any way except to go off tramping with him through cities and the wild lands. One object of the book is to inspire the reader with a desire to enlist in this limited and peripatetic army of martyrs.</p><p>Now, it is undeniable that a few of our upper poets have recognized this as the true voice of a seer in the wilderness. It is equally undeniable that this outlandish soul has conceived many large imaginings, and has outlined them frequently in fitting words. No one can fail to see that this tramp has all the faculties and powers necessary for honorable travel through any realm of earth and air. His epithets and describing words are often admirable. His poetic vision is sometimes clear enough to bring new stars of thought 'to swim within the ken.' He suggests no living or dead man except Ossian,1 and him he imitates with a loud voice. Some bits of lofty expression seem to be Ossianic echoes, but there the resemblance ends. Ossian never fell into [illegible]. Whitman rolls delightedly in the mud-bath. Ossian was always perceptible through his wildest flying clouds. Whitman delights in a jar of sounds which have no clear articulation, and affects the pose of the unconditioned and unthinkable Me. The few glimpses of good through his work seem to come from accidental chinks.</p><p>Whitman's obscenity has provoked the condemnation which he delights to invite. It is of a singular kind. He has fewer unspeakable words than Rabelais,2 and perhaps fewer gross ideas than the gentle Montaigne,3 but Rabelais and Montaigne never went beyond the customary limit of their times, nor reveled in their dirt, but only seemed to go through it in process of natural travel. But Whitman, in an age which has excluded some things from print, seizes upon them as his best and most loving expression of an ideal that has nothing beneath it. With him, love is not allowed the delicate withdrawal of anything from the public gaze. There is nothing so personal that it may be kept sacred, or, at least, invisible. The worst coarseness of Rosseau's Confessions4 is produced here. The corruption exposed in this book would 'infect to the North Star.' Worst of all, it is his text and glory, which he seeks to expound as the teacher and personal propagator of a coming race of fine bodies and souls. The new evolution will develop man into the goatish Satyr and woman into the leaping, foaming Bacchanal. This may not be insanity, but if not, it is 'devilish depravity.'</p><p>Time and space would fail to quote fair samples, out of what is quotable of the perverse workings of this man's brain, but a few may be given. Here is a specimen of the uncouth greatness of his imagination:</p><p>Hefts of the moving word at <br>Innocent gambols silently <br>Rising, freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.</p><p>Here he is in a better mood:</p><p>I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,<br>Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling <br>and mixing,<br>With, at times, a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off <br>star<br>Appearing and disappearing.</p><p>He explains his inspiration thus:</p><p>Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to <br>measure itself,<br>It provokes me forever, it says, sarcastically,<br><em>Walt, you contain enough, why don't you let it out <br>then? </em></p><p>He describes himself in this person:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son, . . . . <br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and <br>breeding,<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>He explains the limit of his happiness:</p><p>I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and <br>am happy,<br>To touch my person to some one else's<em> is about as <br>much as I can stand.</em></p><p>And he tells whom and why he loves:</p><p>I dote on myself, <em>there is that lot of me</em> and all so <br>luscious.</p><p><em>Ohe! jam satis!</em> What shall be thought of the man and teacher, who, whatever else he has said, has said such stuff as this?</p><p>It is quite natural that the voice of the new evangel of Art, which has abjured reason, should also abjure rhyme. The object of the book is to deify impulse and lawlessness. What is first desired must be right: the fetters of law are unnatural and tyrannical. So the poet sings without rhyme or rhythm. Every line has its own length regardless of all others, as if in this alone lay the odic force. There is none of the gentle scan of sea-waves, but only the chopping swells of cross-seas. But it must be poetry, for every line begins with a capital letter, and the poet declares that it is poetry, having the chief virtue that you cannot understand it until you have got further along and taken a tramp with Walt Whitman. In two or three places he has put himself under the bondage of rhythm and rhyme. Whenever he does this he writes lines that will live\u2014notably, his 'O Captain, my Captain,' inspired by the fall of Lincoln. This is more than a fine poem, and lamentably shows what Whitman might have done had he not been Walt Whitman.</p><p>In this stage of social evolution mankind has passed beyond hearing the mental and spiritual tramps.

Let us see wherein the poetry of the future differs from the poetry of the past and the present, and whether it can make good its title to be considered the poetry of the future.</p><p>Walt Whitman is a great poet\u2014in his own estimation, and in that of critics who make up in noise what they lack in numbers. This volume is intended to demonstrate to the world that his claim is well-founded; for, like other great men who have an original message to deliver to the world, he has been misunderstood. He should not complain, however, but remember that obloquy is the ordinary lot of genius. This volume, we repeat, is intended to be his vindication. We have read it carefully and curiously-curiously, because though we had heard much of Whitman before, we confess to dense ignorance of all but a hundred lines or so of his writings\u2014and we do not hesitate to say that it is a volume admirably calculated to convince those who were previously of his opinion. That it will convince others we\u2014but this is to pass judgment before the cause is argued.</p><p><strong>His Moral Tone.</strong></p><p>We should not be true to our own convictions if we neglected to protest, on the very threshold of the subject, against the coarse filthiness of the book. The author is by turns blasphemous and obscene, for the mere sake of showing that he dare do anything and say anything that he chooses. We are not sure that the book is not amenable to the laws against sending obscene literature through the mails; and were the Society for the Suppression of Vice to test the matter, any ordinary jury would give a verdict in its favor. The plea that the book is 'literature' does not excuse such unmitigated and indefensible nastiness as disfigures some of its pages. Byron and Swinburne and Oscar Wilde are as modest as a young maiden by comparison. To write such a book and send it forth to the world with a complacent smirk required great courage\u2014or brazen effrontery\u2014on the part of its author; and it is strange that he should have obtained the imprint for it of so respectable a publishing house. [illegible] </p><p>Walt Whitman's artistic creed is easily understood. He states it on the very first page of this volume:</p><p><em>I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer <br>and greater one than any, <br>Waged in my book with varying fortune, with <br>flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr'd <br>and wavering, <br>(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the <br>last), the field the world, <br>For life and death, for the Body and for the eter- <br>nal Soul. </em></p><p>That is it, war on the social customs and opinions of the age, on its morals, its religion\u2014on everything. Again he says:</p><p>I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not de-<br>cline to be the poet of wickedness also.</p><p>Decline? He jumps at the chance, and wallows in vice and crime at every opportunity. The poet's friends tell us that his life has been correct, that only in his verse is he a libertine; so much the worse for him, he cannot even plead in extenuation of his offence that he had become so accustomed to evil that it is second nature to him. Deliberate baseness is always worse than the baseness that is the outcome of a depraved and bestial nature.</p><p><strong>Is Walt Whitman a Poet?</strong></p><p>No one will dispute Byron's place in the temple of fame, however severely he may condemn the poet's character and the impress it has left on his work. Walt Whitman may be a poet in spite of his immorality. He asks us to accept him as a poet, as a great poet, with a bold egotism which must be either the height of sublimity or the height of folly. Is he a poet?</p><p>That depends, of course, on what one means by poetry. If by poetry we mean verse composed according to regular rhythmical laws, with or without rhyme, Walt Whitman is not a poet. Regular he never is; rhythmical he is at times, but in a wild and irregular way; and of rhyme he is very sparing, for the most part avoiding it altogether. If there are in this volume six consecutive lines to be found anywhere that will 'scan' perfectly according to any one known metre, it may safely be assumed that they exist wholly by accident, not by the poet's design. He simply happened to express himself in that way. But we do not believe that six such lines are to be found; we have looked diligently, and have not discovered them. To return: if poetry be admitted to be, as to its essence, independent of mere form; if irregular, capricious and rugged rhythmical forms be conceded fittingly to embody poetical thought and constitute a different thing from merely poetical prose; then it will be hard to deny that Walt Whitman is, at infrequent intervals, a true poet. That he is a great poet is a preposterous claim, that is not worth the trouble of serious refutation.</p><p>Let us illustrate. Are the following passages poetry or are they not?</p><p>The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice;<br>Let the multitude of isles be glad.<br>Clouds and darkness are round about him;<br>Righteousness and judgment are the habitation <br>of his throne.<br>A fire goeth before him,<br>And burneth up his enemies round about.<br>His lightnings enlightened the world:<br>The earth saw and trembled;<br>The hills melted like wax at the presence of the <br>Lord,<br>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<br>The heavens declare his righteousness,<br>And all the people see his glory.</p><p>Departed then over the wavy sea<br>The floater, foamy-necked, most like to a bird,<br>Till about an hour of the second day<br>The twisted prow had sailed,<br>That the voyagers saw land, ocean shores shine,<br>Mountains steep, spacious sea-nesses.<br>Then was the sea-sailer<br>At the end of its watery way.</p><p>The first passage is from Psalm 97; the second a faithful translation from Beowulf, one of the oldest and most valuable relics of Anglo-Saxon literature. The Psalms are commonly called poetry, yet they have neither rhyme nor regular rhythm; Beowulf is called poetry, yet it has nothing to distinguish it from prose but a sort of alliteration. If it be admitted that the above are poetry\u2014of a genuine, though perhaps not of the most perfect, sort\u2014Walt Whitman's claim to be a poet is, perhaps, borne out, but his claim to be an original poet is made ridiculous. At the best he has done ill what David did well over three thousand years ago. But admitting that the Psalms are poetry, can we deny the same title to these lines?</p><p>Smile O voluptuous cool breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of the departed sunset\u2014earth of the <br>mountains misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon <br>just tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbow'd earth\u2014rich apple-blos- <br>som'd earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.</p><p>Whether the thought in the above was really worth the trouble of expressing may be a question, but that it is poetically expressed can there be doubt? And where in all English literature should we look for two more exquisite pictures than these, from a poem on Lincoln's death, 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed'?</p><p>In the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse <br>near the white-wash'd palings,<br>Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart- <br>shaped leaves of rich green,<br>With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, <br>with the perfume strong I love,<br>With every leaf a miracle\u2014and from this bush <br>in the dooryard,<br>With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>A sprig with its flower I break.<br>. . . . . . .</p><p>Pictures of growing spring and farms and <br>homes.<br>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the <br>gray smoke lucid and bright.<br>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, <br>indolent, sinking sun, burning, expand-<br>ing the air,<br>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and <br>the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,<br>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast <br>of the river, with a wind dapple here and there,<br>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a <br>line against the sky, and shadows,<br>And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, <br>and stacks of chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life and the workshops, <br>and the workmen homeward returning.</p><p>Tennyson never wrote a more dainty love-song than this from 'Sea-drift:'</p><p>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,<br>Day come white, or white come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home.<br>Singing all time, minding no time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Occasionally he is capable of setting a sublime truth in words that are as beautifully fitted for the purpose as the jeweller's fine gold is to receive and hold the diamond; as when he says of the grass:</p><p>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord.<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly <br>dropt,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the cor-<br>ners, that we may see and remark, and <br>say <em>Whose?</em> </p><p>Or where he says in the same poem, 'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.'</p><p><strong>The Other Side of the Question.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, while one is wading through the unnumbered lines of dreary trash in this volume, how often is he tempted to declare that Walt Whitman has not the poet's gift in the slightest measure\u2014that he is only an ignorant American youth whose culture has been gained wholly from the street-corner and the daily newspaper, who has been smitten with a desire for notoriety, and has shrewdly determined that to be odd and singular is the shortest cut to that end. In what respect do his writhings and contortions, his twistings and turnings of our good old English tongue, differ from the affected attitudes and 'intense' dialect of the 'consummately utter' \u00e6sthete who gives us so much sport today? After all, does the ability to write a few fine lines constitute one a poet? Does one kernel of wheat in a bushel of chaff warrant us in giving the name 'grain' to the whole? Evidently not, but evidently also, the single kernel of wheat is wheat in spite of the vast preponderance of chaff. May the question not be answered somewhat like this: Walt Whitman is a poet, after a fashion, but he has written very little poetry. If he is not of those who 'die with all their music in them,' as Dr. Holmes sings, he yet may have succeeded in uttering but a small part of the music that is in him. For noise, be it remembered, is not music.</p><p>One further characteristic needs to be touched on in forming a complete and final judgment of the value of Whitman's work. He shows an aptness now and then for coining those</p><p>Jewels five-words-long<br>That on the stretched forefinger of all Time<br>Sparkle forever.</p><p>What could be better, for example, than his description of the sound of the carpenter's plane, as it 'whistles its wild ascending lisp'? Anybody who has ever heard the sound will appreciate the striking fitness of the phrase. 'Far-sprinkled systems' is a most happy epithet for the clear sky of a winter's night; and nothing could better picture in words the thronged thoroughfares of New York than this line:</p><p>When million-footed Manhattan unpent de-<br>scends to her pavements.</p><p>What poet has apostrophized Death more happily than this: 'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet'? And in all the poetry written about the death of President Garfield, has there been a single phrase so peculiarly happy as 'the sobbing of the bells\u2026those heartbeats of a Nation in the night'? But if one shall say of these things, One swallow does not make a summer, nor do a few happy turns of phrase make a poet\u2014for our part we could only assent.</p><p>But, it may be asked, does Walt Whitman never submit to the trammels of poetry, as poetry is ordinarily conceived? Never fully, yet once he comes very near to doing so\u2014in a poem on the death of Lincoln\u2014and this is the result:</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is <br>done,<br>The ship has weather'd every rock, the prize we <br>sought is won,<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people <br>all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel <br>grim and daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the <br>bells;<br>Rise up\u2014for you the flag is hung\u2014for you the <br>bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths\u2014for <br>you the shores a-crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning;<br>Here Captain! dear father!<br>This arm beneath your head!<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale <br>and still,<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will,<br>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage <br>closed and done,<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won;<br>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>But I with mournful tread,<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>The most prejudiced will not deny that that is poetry, but Walt Whitman is not half so proud of it himself as he is of some of his 'barbaric yawps.' Nevertheless, he will be known fifty years hence\u2014if he is known then at all, which we more than half-doubt\u2014only as the author of 'My Captain,' on the whole, probably, the most stirring lyric that the civil war produced. Contrast with such a poem lines like these:</p><p>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow <br>flapping, with the myriads of gulls win-<br>tering along the coasts of Florida,<br>[illegible] <br>Otherways, there atwixt the banks of the <br>Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the Nueces,<br>the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring <br>waters laughing and skipping and running.</p><p>Not every writer can drop so quickly and so naturally as he from the level of pure poetry to what is not even prose, but mere drivel.</p><p><strong>A Final Word or Two.</strong></p><p>Walt Whitman is the peculiar product of a peculiar condition of things. He is the 'Bowery Bhoy' in literature, a rowdy with the cacoethes scribendi (in plain English, the itch for writing). He could not have been bred anywhere but in a certain part of New York city a generation ago\u2014in any other place or at another time he could no more have been developed than Plymouth Rocks can be hatched out of cobble-stones. And American letters were in a peculiar transition state when he made his first appearance in print, which fact alone made his career possible. A few devoted admirers have diligently puffed him, and the more judicious critics have ridiculed him into a sort of fame. It is a common saying among publishers that next to very warm praise of a book downright abuse on the part of the critics will best promote its sale. But a popularity thus created is always short-lived; people buy the book for a few weeks just to see whether the critics have told the truth about it, and finding that they have, toss it aside never to look at it again.</p><p>Walt Whitman has certain artistic virtues, it is true; he can paint a pretty pen-picture of nature as it presents itself to the eye, but he has no word for us of 'the still, sad music of humanity' heard throughout nature. How can he tell us what he has never seen\u2014what he has no eyes to see? He has a certain rough power, an aboriginal gift, so to speak, of poetic language, but he is uncouth and barbaric. He has fire, but it destroys oftener than it warms. Though he affects to be as broad as the universe, he is narrow\u2014he has but one note to his pipe, and that a cracked one. Pathos is an element of his power, but it must be allowed that bathos is much more frequent in his writings. As Landor said of Byron, 'there are things in him as strong as poison and original as sin.' He is, after all, too many-sided to be characterized in a single phrase\u2014many-sided in good qualities as well as in evil: At one time he is a dithyrambic Emerson calmly philosophizing on the spiritual truths of the universe; at another he is a prose Swinburne run mad. He is a wicked Tupper; he is an obscene Ossian; he is a poetical Zola; he is\u2014Walt Whitman.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By WALT WHITMAN. 12mo. pp. 382 Boston: J.R.

He is, we are constantly told, a great poet and a big wind-bag, a profound seer and a boisterous humbug. He disgusts or inspires, he awakens either disdain or devotion. The fine tone of truth has seldom been touched in his case, by even trustworthy critics\u2014although Mr. Stedman has made a temperate and discriminate review of his work. This poet must be, it is insisted, rejected wholly or accepted, and to those who accept him\u2014especially to the young hearts and minds that look straight and sharply to the future\u2014he is an interesting and suggestive personality. It is certainly true that the large reading public, and above all the masses whom Whitman celebrates and extols, have barely an acquaintance or none at all with his books. They have heard of him by way of much acrimonious controversy, and they have perhaps learned by this time that he counts his supporters among some of the liberal and trained minds of Europe. But his public has been, unfortunately, a narrow circle, and his books have not, therefore, been tested after the usual and trying fashion. A chance is now offered to readers who wish to find out for themselves what sort of a poet Whitman is, for his stray writings, collected in a single and convenient book, have just been published, rearranged and edited by the author. This book is the life work, the first and final word, of Walt Whitman. It presents him\u2014or, as he would probably say, his personality\u2014under all possible lights. It brings together, at last, the fractions and outgrowths of his poetic scheme; and it gains thus a harmony and an intellectual completeness which have been heretofore distinctly wanting. If there is clear purpose, and if there is philosophical conception, in Whitman's poems\u2014'ravings' is the word more often said\u2014they should be apparent now. As to his poetic scheme, aside from quality and method of endeavor, that has a breadth and an originality which criticism cannot lessen if it would. Just what this scheme is may be briefly pointed out. Whitman holds himself to be, in the first place, the representative of new forces in society and in nature. He stands for the American democracy, for the unity and supremacy of the mass, for a nationality which may be regarded as the focus and adjustment of all past nationalities, and for a liberty of body and spirit which no other people save the American people has been finally crowned with. So much for his Americanism, which has an inherent meaning and a power, in spite of all that is said to the contrary. The new forces of nature which Whitman represents in his scheme are scientific forces. As Shelley and Hugo have stood forth and sung for revolutionary progress, he stands forth and sings for scientific progress. Others have pictured the future through clamor and fire of struggle; he pictures it through the spiritual and material evolution of man. It is here that Whitman is most personal and original. He is the first poet who has touched nature through close knowledge; the first poet who has suggested amply(?) the law and the harmony of the universe, the first who has looked upon external life as a cosmos. He\u2014the leader of his line\u2014has attempted to express what Henry Sedgwick called 'cosmic emotion.' He has undertaken to grasp the facts of the world and to make these known as poetic facts; to avoid those new literary idealisms and conventionalisms which, to the naturalist and thoughtful observer, are empty child-talk. Poets have written nobly and feelingly of the force and mystery of nature, but always with the slightest possible bulk of learning. Nature is fittingly, truthfully, and powerfully described in the great books of science, not in the songs of the poets. Whitman must have felt this long ago, and he threw himself into the spirit of his century, a century of broad inquiry, keen analysis, and wonderful synthesis. Many of his poems contain the only glimpses to be found in poetry of the real order and meaning of nature. His poetic scheme, therefore, may be rightfully called original.</p><p>Democracy and cosmos\u2014these, then, are the two starting points in Whitman's ambitious undertaking. His ideas radiate from these points. They lead to his views upon humanity, personality, individual freedom, fraternity, and labor; to his notion of the identity of body and spirit; to his theory of chastity and morality; to his idealization of peoples and trades; to the necessity of egotism and charity; to his conception of progress, and to the essential godhead of man. He seeks, perhaps unconsciously, to stand as an idealist and as a realist, to make democracy and men seem what they are not, and to tell plain facts about them at the same time. Toward nature he is, so far as he goes, a realist; because he is always striving to realize the truth\u2014absolutely the scientific truth\u2014of nature. He is, it is plain, an optimist and an egotist of the most pronounced type; for to be these is to arrive, with him, at natural conclusions. His motive as a poet is essentially a manly and straightforward one, however far and wrong of the mark he may occasionally go; for he preaches purity, courage, virility, liberty, and effort. It is one of his doctrines that there is nothing immoral in fact or in act: there is simply immorality of purpose. He believes that there is forgiveness for all sins, and, perhaps, that Walt Whitman is especially designed to define such forgiveness. He believes in the strength and glory and security of humanity, and, by a clear deduction, in the immensity of self. He incarnates humanity in himself, and his mission, in his own eyes, becomes Christ-like. He disdains, of course, the accepted laws of art. He imagines that he can do without these. He constructs, therefore, a language fitted to himself. He stands\u2014so he seems to think\u2014too high for art. Beauty of form may be left to the polishers and piano players; it is not for the prophets and the Whitmans. On the whole, we have here a poet who has frankly tried less to write a book than to find voice for a man. In one of his first poems he exclaims: 'The modern man I sing.' In one of his last he adds: 'Who touches this touches a man.' His text is\u2014and it is a stalwart text: 'I stand in my place, with my own day, here!'</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>It has been shown what Whitman has striven to be and to do. No one could be more in sympathy with what is real and vital in his scheme than the present writer is. But conception is not execution, and Whitman's plans are infinitely better than his work. One should hardly need to be told, in an epoch so critical and so keenly alive to humor as our own, that mere brag and buncombe and assertion do not pass unchallenged as strength; that noise and strain are not power; that extravagance is not inspiration; that orphic talk is not prophecy. It is right, of course, to credit Whitman with sincerity, with the honesty of his convictions. Many are loth to own this much; though no person, minded to learn and see the truth, can read this poet's work through and fail to feel its occasional fire and stir. Whitman writes, at his best, with deep emotion and conviction. He rises at moments to heights of poetic insight and inspiration. There are a fine lyrical sweep and a genuine epic breadth in a few of his poetic rhapsodies. This would be more clearly felt if his work were not so thickly rutted with that insane kind of nonsense which some devoted worshipers persist in calling great thought and great poetry. Whitman's work is like a rich garden embedded in weed. Flower and weed are here inextricably blended. The brag, and assertion, and wrench of this American seer will never be accepted above their value by those who know that the finest art is a result of the finest sifting of thought, intelligence, emotion, and vigor. Art, in a high sense, is the test of strength, not the sign of weakness. In placing himself above art, in confounding the ability to discriminate and shape with mere technical dexterity, Whitman puts himself on the wrong side of nature. This would not be a matter of much moment, it is true, if his clamorous upholders were not seemingly bent upon elevating his method to a doctrine. The poet who labors with no fetters runs to chaos. Nature is like true art in this; it creates within laws. What is more simple and lovely to the sight than a flower? Yet consider the forces that make the flower, the elements that are parts of it, the intricacy of its mechanism; and compare these with the exquisite grace and appropriateness of its outward form. It is a rule in nature that all chaos shall tend to form and harmony; the universe is, when looked at singly, as simple a thing as the cup of a lily. Whitman and writers with his disposition pretend to be the true sight-seers of nature, while they awkwardly reflect its lawlessness and complexity. The harmony and the simplicity of nature are not shown in Whitman's poems, even when these are most true and suggestive. To teach a doctrine of lawlessness, therefore, is about the least intelligent project that his blind followers have tried to carry out.</p><p>Destructive criticism might be applied to Whitman's little understood and much discussed Americanism. There is certainly a thing which may be called Americanism. This is frequently flashed out in these poems, but it is not lucidly expressed. At times it amounts to palpable rigmarole, which no one but a jaded European nurtured amid the tiresome and mournful strife of the Old World could mistake for the real thing. Our country, it may be explained, represents certain new ideas of nationality and advancement. It represents at the present moment, more strikingly and splendidly than any other land under the sun does, scientific progress as opposed to revolutionary progress. It is a land to which all the currents, and longings, and peoples of history move like rivers converging to one stream and one mouth. It is the mother of individual liberty, freedom of thought, and peaceful labor; a land , therefore, in which the researches of the world are most nobly welcomed, which leads the nations toward a righteous justice, which gives a home to all aliens. What progress may do will awaken here, above all, response and sympathy. Our country illustrates, in brief, the advancing spirit of the nineteenth century. This is certain and clear. On the other hand, we are not a people of the old rugged and uncivilized sort. We are not like those for whom Homer sang, and we stand in no need of a Moses nor of a Mohammed. We are not chiefly\u2014as some of the exuberant persons on the other side of the Atlantic seem to think\u2014hewers of wood and drawers of water. Our lasting honor is\u2014and this is certainly overlooked\u2014that our pioneership is above all intellectual. A ripe and vigorous civilization is at the heart of the land. The rabble and the unthinking mob do not represent our real vitality and progress. It should be plain, then, that our country has a peculiar individuality and a decisive mission. It is a strange union of past, present, and future. A poet like Whitman\u2014who rhapsodies more often than he thinks and sings\u2014is sure to suggest something of our individuality and he has, without doubt, gone further than other poets. But his conception of our land and people is full of inexactitude, full of false idealism, and loaded with extravagance. There is too much of the red-shirted Hoosier about it. It comes close at times to the spread-eagleism of our astonishing orators, and to the fraternity of the bar-room. Its permanent merit is that it reflects, after all, something of the free and creative sprit which is the spring-source of our life. It tells us of our liberty\u2014a small matter which our ancestors strove mournfully through hundreds of years to win, and which, now that we have got it, we are apt to prize rather loosely and humorously.</p><p>All that has been written above might be illustrated by columns of extracts from 'Leaves of Grass.' But others may pick these out for themselves. I have simply sought to show broadly that there are radical sins and false premises at the very basis of these poems. Whitman's theory of life and humanity, and his absolute lack of sound artistic instinct and taste, lead him into extravagances which have as much relation to strong and true song as a fishmonger's bawl has to the melody of birds, or to the musical roll of water upon a stretch of shore. They lead him, also, into some monstrous excesses, and the poems comprised in 'Children of Adam' are naked exhibitions of these. The poems in question have been struck by many lances, denounced by many mouths. Good ink has been wasted upon them. They are over-Whitmanish and not beautiful. In these fleshly diatribes the poet sets out to 'make illustrious' that which is not commonly discussed in sensible and good company. He throws off his shirt, so to speak, and cries lustily. 'Behold, I am Walt Whitman, I am moral.' Poets have sung with more or less sense of creation\u2014Whitman goes down to the actual facts. This may be moral. It is intended as an illustration of the highest morality. But it is\u2014unless the world has gone wrong since the beginning of time\u2014indecent and vulgar, not one degree above the loose talk which is, unfortunately, common enough in low places and high. As to its pretentious morality, that does not deceive, and it is solely justified in the poet's inner consciousness. The things here uttered by Whitman may be, unquestionably, thought of chastely, but they cannot be written down and seem either pure or modest. At best, they are coarse commonplace, imposed upon the reader with prophetic earnestness. At worst, they are unlawful exposures of the person.</p><p>It is a relief to turn from this fustian to the 'Song of Myself,' which is a healthy expression of vigorous humanity and imaginative egotism\u2014a poem in which the relation of a man to his fellow-creatures, and to his world, and to the universe, is set forth at moments with real power of manner, breadth of sympathy, and original feeling. The contradictions in this poem are clearly the result of forethought and design, for it is the good and bad in a man, according to Whitman, that awake the unchecked energy of his nature. 'I resist anything better than my own diversity,' he says. And he adds, with rare courage: 'I accept Reality and dare not question it.' There is the right sort of materialism in the following chant:</p><p>'Smile, O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset\u2014earth of the mountain's <br>misty topt:<br>Earth of the vitreous form of the fall moon just <br>tinged with blue:<br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the <br>river:<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and <br>clearer for my sake.<br>Far-swooping elbow'd earth\u2014rich apple-blossom'd <br>earth.<br>Smile, for you lover comes.</p><p>'Prodigal, you have given me love\u2014therefore I <br>to you give love.<br>Oh, unspeakable, passionate love!'</p><p>Here is another passage from the same poem, and in the poet's less rhapsodic manner:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they <br>are so placid and self-contained.<br>I stand and look at them long and long.</p><p>'They do not sweat and whine about their condi-<br>tion,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for <br>their sins.<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty <br>to God.<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with <br>the mania of owning things,<br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that <br>lived thousands of years ago.<br>Not one is respectable and unhappy over the <br>whole earth.'</p><p>There is, of course, the usual bulk of orphic and oracular utterance in the 'Song of Myself,' and much of this is solemn commonplace merged into a species of transcendentalism. Its meaning is not always clear. But, on the other hand, the poetry in this song has strength and reach. The following verses were admiringly quoted by Prof. Clifford in his essay on 'Cosmic Emotion:'</p><p>'I open my scuttle at night and see the far- <br>sprinkled systems,<br>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher, <br>edge but the rim of the farthest systems.</p><p>'Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always <br>expanding.<br>Outward and outward and forever outward.</p><p>'My sun has his sun, and round him obediently <br>wheels,<br>He joins with his partners a group of superior <br>circuit,<br>And greater sets follow, making specks of the <br>greatest inside them.</p><p>'There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage,<br>If I, you, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, <br>were this moment reduced back to a pallid <br>float, it would not avail in the long run,<br>We should surely bring up again where we now <br>stand,<br>Ana surely go as much farther, and then farther, <br>and farther.</p><p>'A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of <br>cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or <br>make it impatient,<br>They are but parts, anything is but a part.</p><p>'See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of <br>that.'</p><p>In the 'Song of the Open Road,' 'Song of the Answerer,' 'Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Exposition,' 'Song for Occupations,' and in other poems more or less identical in spirit with these, there is expressed with undoubted sincerity and vigor, entire sympathy with the moods of nature, with the longings and work of mankind, and with the various sides of life. They are singular combinations of triviality, prosiness, poetic feeling, and arrogant personality. They lack, above all, the fine simplicity and clear brevity of songs meant for the popular ear and heart. Yet they have an intensely modern and popular spirit:</p><p>'Away with themes of war! away with war <br>itself!<br>Hence from my shuddering sight to never more <br>return that<br>Show of blacken'd mutilated corpses!<br>That hell unspent and void of blood, fit for wild <br>tigers or for lop-tongued wolves, not reason-<br>ing men,<br>And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,<br>With thy undaunted armies engineering,<br>Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,<br>Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.'</p><p>That is Whitman at his best, free of verbiage and pretension, and with something to say worth saying, with honest emotion and good sense. The same lyrical sincerity is felt in the invocation to America, ('Song of the Exposition,') when he speaks of 'the common indivisible destiny for all.' The 'Song of the Redwood Tree' is throughout a fine poem, full of brain and freedom, and the real hope and faith of our time are simply expressed in the 'Song for Occupations:'</p><p>'The sun and stars that float in the open air,<br>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the <br>drift of them is something grand,<br>I do not know what it is except that it is grand <br>and that it is happiness.'</p><p>There are truth, ardor, and inspiration in some of the songs included in 'Bird of Passage,' the best of these being 'Pioneers, Oh Pioneers,' which has a rugged rhythmic movement uncommon in Whitman's writings, although the opening to the 'Music of the Storm' is equally fine, while some few other passages which have an exceptional quality of sound and rhythm are quickly remarked. The tenderness, pathos, and manhood in the series of poems called 'Drum-taps' are, perhaps, the most natural and sympathetic touches in Whitman's copious and curious work, and it may be said of this work, finally, that Whitman himself marks their surest claim to attention in some of his closing verses:</p><p>'Comrades, this is no book,<br>Who touches this touches a man,<br>(Is it night? are we here together alone?)<br>It is I you hold, and who hold you,<br>I spring from the pages into your arms.'</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The permanent value of these poems, in fact, is to be sought in their two clear merits: in their modernness, breadth, and originality of purpose, and in their presentiment of a strong and fresh individuality. The aim of these poems, and the man behind them, are more distinctive than the poems themselves. 'Who touches this touches a man' is an assertion which is felt to be perfectly just. The book\u2014judged by the standard of all great books\u2014falls far below greatness. There is no single poem in it which could be safely compared with any single great poem in our language. Whitman's work is fine in flashes, in strong passages, or in sudden descriptions. It is weighed down, on the other hand, with extravagances and excesses like those already spoken of, with a mass of ill-digested learning, with long stretches of windy prose, with violent and insecure handling of deep themes, with all kinds of crudity and with a manner which is seldom effective and impressive. This manner has been considerably praised by some for its originality and free musical movement, and it has been called by others a formless manner. But it is surely not formless, since it has a perfectly definite form, deliberately chosen and full of artifice. Its rhythm, however\u2014when it has a rhythm\u2014is perfectly commonplace. The prose of F\u00e9n\u00e9lon and Carlyle and the verse of the Bible have incomparably more poetic color, strength of language, melody and harmony of sound, than Whitman's verse at its best. The laws of natural verse are here ignored, and the result is, of course, unnatural. Compare this verse with the unrhymed movement of Shakespeare and Shelley, with that of Wordsworth's sonnets and Keats's odes, and with the rhythmic freedom of Swinburne's 'Song Before Sunrise;' or compare it with the Biblical verse in the Song of Solomon. As to its utility as a medium for the transparent expression of high thought, compare the most intellectual of Whitman's poems with Tennyson's 'In Memoriam.' These comparisons will serve better than criticism\u2014to persons at least who have ears open to musical sound and minds open to conviction. Language is to the poet what color is to the painter, and great and genuine thoughts should have great and genuine expression. To master language, to garment genius fittingly\u2014this is the art of the poet, and this is the art which Whitman and some others appear to despise. It is art that divides truth and passion from commonplace and rant, that draws a sharp line between sustained strength and hyperbolic bluster. Whitman, however, deserves our deepest gratitude for the stand he has taken, in face of this present age, in the fore of its creative work of reconstruction, in front of its iconoclasm and science. Most of the poets\u2014especially the American poet\u2014are probably against him, but the spirit of our time is not to be quenched by literary conventions, and the strong minds of our time are with him. His courageous appeal for more knowledge and still more might be fitly contrasted with the sentimental snivel of those timid creatures who weep at the passing of the good old days. These sad persons are typified by the \u00e6sthetic Mr. Wilde:</p><p>'All romance has flown<br>And men can prophesy about the sun.<br>And lecture on his arrows\u2014how, alone<br>Though a waste void the soulless atoms run,<br>How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,<br>And that no more, 'mid English reeds a Naiad shows <br>her head.</p><p>'Methinks these new Act\u00e6ons boast too soon<br>That they have spied on beauty: what if we<br>Have analyzed the rainbow, robbed the moon<br>Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,<br>Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope<br>Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a <br>telescope?'</p><p>Those two last lines are worthy of Bunthorne; but they show about as much unconscious humor as most of Bunthorne's contemporaries exhibit when they begin to vent their feelings about romance and science. Weigh such words in the balance with the wise words of Prof. Clifford: 'To some minds there is hope and renewing of youth in the sense that the last word is not yet spoken, that greater mysteries yet lie behind the veil. The prophet himself may say with gladness, 'He that cometh after me shall yet be preferred before me.' But others see in the clearer vision that approaches them the end of all beauty and joy in the earth; because their old feelings are not suited to the new learning they think that learning can stir no feelings at all.' In his article upon 'The Poetry of the Future' (published some months ago in the North American Review,) Whitman wrote these words, which are, I believe, good prophecy: 'Science, having extirpated the old stock fables and superstitions, is clearing a field for verse, for all the arts, and even for romance, a hundred-fold ampler and more wonderful, with the new principles behind. Republicanism advances over the whole world. Liberty, with Law by her side, will one day be paramount\u2014will, at any rate, be the central idea. Then only\u2014for all the splendor and beauty of what has been, or the polish of what is\u2014then only will the true poets appear, and the true poems. Not the satin and patchouly of to-day, not the glorification of the butcheries and words of the past, nor any fight between Deity on one side and somebody else on the other\u2014not Milton, not even Shakespeare's plays, grand as they are.'</p><p>G.

Less tutored, and for that reason\u2014education being what it is\u2014less perverted, he is more a creature of his instincts, and, as it happens, not of the higher sort; and taking his stand on these, he utters himself in accents which at times make the more cultivated transcendentalists hold their breath. Walt is the 'enfant terrible' of transcendentalism. His birth was hailed by the corypheus of this sect with a burst of parental joy; subsequently, on close inspection, he appeared to entertain suspicions of his legitimacy, but now, with maturer examination, his doubts have vanished and he recognizes his lineage.</p><p>The difference between the master and the disciple is this: Mr. Emerson revolted against the false restraints of Calvinism, and, in the righteous indignation of his repressed nature, expressed himself passionately and not seldom unguardedly; while Walt Whitman, unconscious of the impious and paralyzing repression of Puritanism, not having the inherited restraints of seven or eight Puritan ministers wrapt in his skin, takes his master's utterances to the letter and acts them out with all the force of the characteristics of his personality, and in great glee 'sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>Is it a matter for congratulation that the sage of Concord, so-called by his disciples, has not sufficiently recovered from the early strain which was put upon him, seriously to listen in his advanced age to wise misgivings and lawfully-begotten fears?</p><p>But man is a rational animal, and not like the beasts, which have no sense; and all effort on his part to play the irrational beast would be ridiculous, were it not a degradation exacting so great a depravation of his nature. But this attempt is never made with impunity, for man's rational nature sooner or later will surely take revenge on him who makes, whether maliciously or otherwise, the experiment. No, it is not a thing for laughter, but a serious matter, when a man is led to believe that he can with impunity violate any one essential law of his rational being. It is a more serious matter when the leaders of public opinion encourage in a community a belief of this kind, or aid in the spreading of literature infected with such opinions. It is a most serious matter, considering their effect on the coming generation; for the harvest of the poisonous seeds sown in the tender minds of this, will be reaped in the next. And until men gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles every intelligent, every religious, every moral man, every sincere lover of his race, will set his face fixedly against the teachers and upholders of opinions so degrading to man and so pernicious in their tendency.</p><p>Let us have songs of the 'Enfans d'Adam'\u2014not of the old Adam, but the new! Let us have songs of that blissful communion which existed between God and man in the Garden of Eden\u2014communion lost, alas! by the first Adam, but graciously restored by the second Adam. Songs that spring from this source rise upward and imparadise men's hearts! These are the songs men's souls crave, the age hopes for and is ready to receive.</p>", "date": "February 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Catholic World", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Leaves of Grass.\" February 1882.

And the story ran that Mr. Wendell Phillips, turning the pages of the book, remarked, 'Here seem to be all sorts of leaves except fig leaves.' This was in 1855, and as the original edition lies before us to-day we recall vividly the sensation that was made by its appearance. In the first place, it was an original-looking volume, a homespun affair, a thin quarto of ninety-five pages, printed in large type, and bearing on its title-page no name of any publisher, but only the words 'Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York, 1855.' On the reverse the reader was informed that the book had been duly 'Entered according to act of Congress in the year 1855, by Walter Whitman,' etc., etc., and this was the only clew the public had to the name of the author. Not that the public greatly cared to know. The book was not 'published' in the official sense. It was said that the writer of it was a printer by trade, and that he had set up the type and done all the presswork with his own hands. Perhaps he did the binding as well, for that was as primitive as the rest. Yet, though crude looking to the dapper eyes of the trade, there was a rudimentary good taste in the get-up. The title-page would have pleased Guttenberg or Faust, nor would Aldus himself have despised its large and manly aspect. It is parodied in the new issue, but had Walter Whitman had the ordering of this edition he never would have permitted Mr. Osgood to belittle the title-page with his very uncomfortable trade-monogram, which always makes us think of a trichina, though we have no precise notion of how a trichina looks. We may add that the original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' was embellished with the same portrait of the author that adorns the new Boston edition. The prose preface, however, of ten pages, double columns, is omitted, which is a pity, for it is very characteristic of the author, and shows more clearly than the book itself where the author came from intellectually. Mr. Emerson said once of certain philosophers that they had all been milking the same cow\u2014Swedenborg; and Mr. Whitman, as no one who reads his prose preface can doubt, had been for a long time milking the New England transcendentalists. The preface reads like a selection of papers from the Dial. Parts of it remind one of the 'Manuscript Symphony of Dolon,' but the most of it is an echo of Emerson himself, minus his music and his wit.</p><p>The book, however, was misunderstood, as was to have been expected. Mr. Emerson, who had the penetration to see what was fine and original in it, was as wrong in his judgment of one element in it as was Wordsworth in his judgment of 'Wilhelm Meister.' As Mr. Emerson himself reports: 'He proceeded to abuse Goethe's 'Wilhelm Meister' heartily. It was full of all manner of fornication. It was like the crossing of flies in the air. He had never gone farther than the first part; so digusted was he that he threw the book across the room.' In the marble purity of his mind Mr. Emerson was more shocked than he need have been by Mr. Whitman's plain speaking, for that, after all, is all that his much-berated coarseness amounts to. At first he could not see the wood-god for his phallus. Later, he wrote a letter to Whitman, in which he said, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career.' Whitman showed that he was not quite a god, for he was so tickled with the compliment that he straightway printed it in letters of gold on the back of a new edition of his book. This was a breach of confidence, as Mr. Emerson thought, and he expressed his private indignation at the liberty taken. But what else did he expect? Had he never read Esop?</p><p>Still, whatever may be Mr. Whitman's personal drawbacks, and no writer ever more freely invited the public to an inspection gratis of all his foibles, the fact remains that Mr. Emerson was right in greeting him as he did. If Whitman really does nothing more than enlarge and exaggerate the 'Nature' and the first yolume of 'Essays' of his master, he does it in a way to entitle himself to the award of originality as much as that master is entitled to it. The doctrines of individualism, of personal independence, of the unity of all souls, of the oneness of man with the universe, of the equal birth of good and evil, these are all here as we had heard them sweetly sung or said by the Orphic seer himself, only they were here jumbled, confused, with endless repetition, without art, without taste, without sense of proportion, and absolutely without humor. Here were scorn of the conventions of society by one who never knew them, and who was as ignorant of society as a Digger Indian; the sincerity of cows and dogs and horses, to whom Adam and his wife and the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day were all as one; a primal nakedness of which the author made a great show of not being ashamed, knowing well enough that the logic of his position made shame unreasonable. And all this, with much more, was put forth in good masculine English with farmer-like shrewdness, without mincing of words or phrases; we heard the plain talk of farm-hands and mechanics, of sailors and soldiers, without the fear of women or of dandies before their eyes.</p><p>The new edition of 'Leaves of Grass' has neither the unity nor the expression of the original book. It is not essentially altered in the main part, nor is what coarseness was once there in the least softened or expunged, but it has been gone over too much with the file, rough as it is still left; and all that Whitman has written since the first book appeared is crowded here pell-mell, without order or sequence. It would be a thousand pities were the author judged by the few passages, perhaps not two pages in all, where his frankness pushes him to say things that are really only coarse because they are said. Of indecency, of essential grossness, there is in the book really nothing. It is easy to believe the author as pure-minded, as Incapable of doing or thinking evil, as any best man among us who would blush to be seen in his shirt-sleeves by a woman. All we charge Whitman with on this score is a want of the sense of beauty and proportion, a want of taste, in short, and worst fault of all, an absolute want of humor. He is neither a true American nor a Greek. Were he the former, he would have a sense of humor; were he the latter, he would have a sense of art. But we owe him a just debt for being what he is, and for the much that he has written it would not be easy to repay him with grateful words. He and Emerson are the only poets we have thus far produced; all the rest are imitators, or make-believes, or players upon jewsharps. But Emerson sits far above Whitman by virtue of his noble art, and, little as he has produced, cannot be brought into comparison with his more prolific disciple. The original 'Leaves of Grass' will remain a real contribution to the thought of America, and some of the additional pieces, 'My Captain, O My Captain,' 'Song of the Banner at Daybreak,' 'Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Rocking,' once read can never be forgotten.</p><p>CLARENCE COOK.</p>", "date": "February 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "Clarence Cook", "publication": "The International Review", "citation": "Cook, Clarence. \"Some Recent Poetry.\" February 1882.

Need it be said that we speak of Walt Whitman? We are far from slighting the claims of Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell, and a host of others, but it must be admitted that little or nothing distinctively American has sprung from the best of them. Let us for a moment look at America. The great Western Continent is like a Medea\u2019s cauldron into which along, with the best blood of Europe, Asia and Africa, contributed by annual streams of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, are shredded all the creeds, philosophies, customs and opinions on the face of the earth, Which will find the late of Jason\u2019s uncle, and which of his father, which will be rejuvenated and which will perish out of these mingled traditions French, German, English, Norwegian, Russian, Chinese, in short, of every nation, this is the great problem to be solved, this is the theme which in its entirety no philosopher but Herbert Spencer, no poet but Walt Whitman has ever grappled with. The destinies of our own and of every other country bid fair to be decided in the ultimate outcome of the cauldron, whatever it may be. Is it to be wondered at then that we welcome eagerly the only two men who have seriously set themselves to the task of foreseeing that and telling us frankly as much as they have got foresight of? We now concern ourselves only with the poet, however. His life is as strange as his poetry. At present he is a man of about fifty years of age, still strong and stalwart in spite of a severe stroke of paralysis which prostrated him a year or two ago. He earns his living by the sale of his works, being his own publisher and printer. His leisure is spent in loafing about in a Guernsey shirt and Panama hat among the artizans of Brooklyn and Paumanok and New York, whose society he prefers to any other, but he is accessible to all who want to see him from the highest to the lowest. He seems to have taken up and laid down again a hundred different occupations, having been among other things a pioneer in the backwoods, a tramway conductor in New York, a soldier in the great civil war, a hospital nurse, a newspaper correspondent, and a bookseller. He is said to have written several tales and verses which fell dead from the press before he betook himself to the composition of his great work, his only book indeed, 'Leaves of Grass.' This has employed his whole energy during the last fifteen years. The plan of it enables him to alter and add to it from time to time at his pleasure. The title should speak for itself, yet it may be as well to explain it. Whitman, claiming only to be the poet of common experiences, typifies them naturally under the commonest of common things-grass. Each though is, as it were, a leaf or blade therof which he offers to the reader. But cannot the reader find such thoughts for himself? That is the very conclusion to which the poet would lead him. What then, to enter into particulars, is our author\u2019s subject-matter? The question should rather be, What is not? He sings of all things with the enthusiasm and yet impartiality of nature herself. He is at once the most egotistic and most universal of bards. He invariably speaks in the first person singular but never of the first person singular. It is of you and me and every one, good, bad, and indifferent he talks. He tells us that he loves us and proves it by narrating as parts of his own being our inmost thoughts and feelings, joys and sorrows. Our very crimes he does not shrink from. Sins that we would hide from sun and moon he brings into the glaring light of noonday, but not to condemn\u2014far from it\u2014to shield us, rather, from the world\u2019s scorn by showing them to be natural, and as belonging to himself as much as to anybody. If his book had had a motto it should have been, 'Nihil humani a me alienum puto.' Let it not be supposed that Walt Whitman makes nothing of vice and misery. No one suffers from the sense of them more than he does. But his horror and hatred of sin are always associated with pity and love for the sinner. He regards wickedness\u2014as it should be regarded everywhere\u2014as disease, and nothing more. Had it been so treated for the last thousand years it might have been eradicated from the earth by this time. Whitman celebrates the body equally with the soul (in fact he observes no absolute distinction between the two), and woman equally with man. He carries the doctrine of liberty, equality and fraternity to hitherto undreamed-of issues. He believes in harmonies where theologians catch nothing but discords. Far from looking upon this immeasurable universe as the stakes, as it were, of an eternal game of Whist, in which God and the Soul are partners against the Flesh and the Devil, he takes it to be a field in which all forces on the one side and on the other, contend together in friendly rivalry. He represents Satan as one of the persons of the Godhead. He chants of the Holy Spirit as</p><p>Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including Saviour and Satans,<br>Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive,<br>Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man\u2014the general Soul.</p><p>In the deepest sense of the expression , a sense in which Pope, its originator, would never have dared to use it, he believes that 'whatever is, is right,' knowing that in order to [have] one thing being otherwise all the past must have been different throughout infinity and eternity. He accepts and simultaneously rejects every form of religion and philosophy; accepts it as a sufficient embodiment of thought for the times which developed it, but rejects it as inadequate for any other time. He gives us song after song of love and friendship such as have never been sung by mortal man before. He does what no other poet could do\u2014he makes you feel as if, in spite of his never having met you, he were your bosom friend, such as one has dreamt of in school-days, and his words then become sacred to you as a private letter. When we add that our poet tackles astronomy, geology, physiology, chemistry, and in short all the sciences with the same ardour, and that yet he disdains not to sing of the butcher, the baker, and candlestick-maker, the sailor and soldier, and every other individual high or low, beast, man, insect, flower, or stone, we are scarcely sure that we have given even a shadow of an idea of the versatility of genius, and the boundless sympathies and intentions of the man. We recommend our readers to discover as soon as possible how incomplete and inaccurate this notice is by reading Walt Whitman\u2019s volume for themselves. We would as soon attempt to write the topography of the globe as to give a minute description of 'Leaves of Grass.' We have kept to the last a statement, all-important in the case of a Tennyson or a Virgil, but hardly worth mentioning in that of a Walt Whitman, namely, that our author writes in a style neither prose nor verse, the pauses, periods, and rhythms, of which are peculiarly his own. We finish with a quotation.</p><p><em>I DREAMED IN A DREAM</em><br>I dreamed in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth,<br>I dreamed that was the new city of Friends,<br>Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led the rest.<br>It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city<br>And in all their looks and words.</p>", "date": "March 21 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Mace: A Weekly Record of Glasgow Parliamentary Debating Association", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1881\u201382)].\" 21 March 1882.

Such a mind seems to be that of the very eminent critic and scholar who not long since contributed an extraordinary eulogium to one of the leading magazines upon Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.' After having read the essay, we sought in vain for those immortal beauties which he discovered in that eccentric, tiresome, flatulent, raw volume of rhapsodies by Walt Whitman, suppressed in Massachusetts. Mr. Whitman has found another publisher in Philadelphia, and a copy bearing the imprint of Rees, Welsh & Co., lies upon our table\u2014entire, priapic, undraped.</p><p>The eminent critic himself, already alluded to, could not, with all his artistic ingenuity, discover any gems of fine thought in the scoriac deposit of that lava-flow of lust, that orgiastic outpouring of coarseness entitled 'Children of Adam.' He certainly did himself the justice to condemn this portion of the work, more or less mildly, to the great annoyance of its creator. Even granting that Walt Whitman has immense genius, lofty sentiment, artistic strength\u2014which we cannot\u2014the 'Children of Adam' would condemn him beyond redemption. Piron was a genius, indeed; but his name will ever be associated with that infamous Ode which befouls his place in literature. </p><p>Yet we would not pretend to judge this portion of Mr. Whitman's work from the standpoint of religious or purely social ethics. In art even that which is highly condemnable by such standards finds indulgence; and perfection of form excuses nudity. There is a holiness about the marble nakedness of an antique goddess that compels respect;\u2014there is a holiness in the passion loveliness creates. The Soul of the Universe is love, permeating, divinizing\u2014finding its loftiest expression in dreams marble-frozen and gem-chiselled\u2014in songs of poets\u2014in the wizard work of musicians\u2014in all the longing of humanity for the Ideal and Impossible. But the duty of art is to elevate our conceptions, to inspire the desire for what is nobler and better than what we have known\u2014to create ideals for future generations to realize\u2014even as Greek mothers brought forth children comely and graceful as the statues of the sculptors. The Naturalists are not artists. They describe only that which is; they are mere dissectors when they are not mere photographers. They acknowledge their work disgusts; and by disgusting people with what is, they hope to inspire them with a thirst for what is not! They are the Nihilists of literature.</p><p>Well, Mr. Whitman is an American Naturalist, quite as reckless as Zola or Maupassant, but withal infinitely less talented, less skillful. The chief difference between the American Naturalist and his ultra-Atlantic brethren, is that he does not profess to revolt his readers for a good purpose\u2014although he does revolt them to no purpose that we can discover. In fact, he imagines that he charms! He describes what is as he conceives it; and seems to imagine himself a great revelator of nature's secrets. There are things which should not be described unless idealized, and therefore only by the high-priests of art. Mr. Whitman imagines himself to be such; and breaks through all canons of good taste, all rules of decency, all conventionalities that the boldest art respects. The result is more or less disgusting;\u2014it is like a navvy trying to model nudities out of mud!</p><p>Pages 86 and 87\u2014('I Sing the Body Electric')\u2014are evidence of this indecency of taste. We do not refer to lasciviousness so much as to coarseness\u2014not to immorality, so much as vulgarity. Swinburne's muse is in some respects more immoral than Mr. Whitman's, but her nudity is of the grand antique sort and her dancing graceful. Her unclad splendor may be judged admiringly, apart from her reputation. But Mr. Whitman's muse is at once indecent and ugly, lascivious and gawky, lubricous and coarse.</p><p>What nobler theme for art than a perfect human body?\u2014the noblest monuments of the world's literatures all contain niches for unclad types of beauty\u2014from the earliest Indian epics to the latest masterpieces of modern verse! But what does Mr. Whitman offer us on these two hideous pages? A series of scenes alternately suggesting a dissecting room and a butcher's shop! He talks about 'naked meat!' What is meat? It is dead flesh!</p><p>Cannibalism?</p><p>And 'jaw-hinges,' 'roof of the mouth,' 'knee-pans,' 'leg-fibre,' 'thin red jellies,' 'lung-sponges,' 'bowels,' 'sweat,' 'scapula,' 'elbow-sockets,' 'the bones and the marrow within the bones'\u2014and many other things which none but Mr. Whitman would mention at all!</p><p>But he tells us these things are the soul! Would it not be more decent to say that he does not believe in individual souls? Is it philosophy even to declare that the 'sweat' and the 'bowels' and 'the toe-joints' are not only parts of the soul, but the soul itself!</p><p>In the downright lubricity of certain lines, we can only say that Mr. Whitman has fully equalled, if not exceeded the extant writers of antiquity, and has used phraseology only to be expected in those surreptitiously circulated works the publication whereof is accounted a crime by the law of all civilized nations.</p><p>He may claim to deal only with legitimate passion; but his treatment of it is illegitimate to the degree of outrage. He has one advantage over his critics, however;\u2014they cannot quote him!</p><p>Elsewhere, there is some philosophy in the book; there are pages of force and rough beauty; there is originality, depth, strong feeling. The book is not the creation of a literary quack. It is the work of an honest man\u2014rude in his conceptions, reckless in his expressions, erroneous occasionally in his deductions, eccentric, erratic, inartistic, enthusiastic, dogmatic likewise. What he writes he believes to be good and beautiful. Some agree with him. We do not. We hold much of his book to be infamous according to the universal code of ethics; and contrary to all just standards of taste; largely shapeless, nebulous\u2014with here and there an appearance of bright and solid nuclei.

Anything, everything, is a fit subject. Art has no business with leading-strings or handcuffs or gags. It says to you, 'Go;' and turns you loose into the great garden of poetry where there is no forbidden fruit.'</p><p>This is Victor Hugo's protest against the disapprobation of those French critics whose conventional imaginations were very much disturbed by the astonishing leaps through time and space that were made by this untrammelled and disorderly genius. It is this same 'quidquid agunt homines,' unrestrained freedom of choice, that Walt Whitman has so urgently insisted upon, when the well-regulated public has remonstrated at what he calls liberty, and society license. If we 'look at the matter widely,' as Hugo recommends, we shall be inclined to agree with the French poet that art should not be handcuffed, and admit as the final test only that the result shall be good poetry; but then this final test must be firmly insisted upon. If a poet has produced really fine poetry, no matter what his material may have been, he has justified himself, at least from the standpoint of his art. But in order to apply this test substantially, we must consider what really good art is; and we find it to be the noble expression of noble ideas; and if it fail in either of these directions it ceases to be the best art. If the ideas are no longer worthy, while the form remains perfect, we have an art that rapidly deteriorates and becomes trivial, and bears within it the germ of decay. If, on the other hand, the ideas are noble and the form indifferent, we have an imperfect, incomplete art, that if it be in a healthy state must soon develop into fuller and finer expression. There is, therefore, not the danger that those concerned with the merely moral side of the question might suppose, in setting art free and cutting her leading strings, as long as the real function of art is recognized. There are plenty of restrictions left, in the severe restraint on hand and eye and speech that true art imposes on her honest servants. What matters it how poor, how mean, how simple the material, if the touch of the artist can turn it to gold, if the imagination can glorify it? There is a certain superb license that brings its own apology with it, when a man of genius is carried over the bounds of convention by the rush of passion, or the glory of beauty, or the heat of a fervid imagination, and is grand at the same time that he is gross, as Shakespeare was sometimes, or Rubens. But if he is only gross without being grand, then there is no quarter for him anywhere, and he is rejected both by morals and art. Realism, for its own sake, has no place in art, least of all in poetry; for poetry, by its very form, separates itself from prose as an imaginative manner of expressing the ideal side of nature and of man's emotions, passions and actions. In prose even brutal realism sometimes justifies itself, when there is need to make reality seem as terribly real as possible and to present facts impressively; but we see to what degradation poetry can be reduced by conscientiously applied realism, even in the hands of a poet of imagination and the most refined sensibilities, a poet who had produced the finest imaginative poetry, in Wordsworth's 'Simon Lee.' And we see to what infinitely lower degradation realism can bring a man without refined sensibilities and a cultivated imagination in Whitman's 'Children of Adam.'</p><p>It is only another proof of the enormous egotism of the man, that he should claim to have made a new departure in insisting on the physical basis of passion, as there is scarcely a poet from Anacreon to Swinburne who has failed to do it ample justice. All that he has done is to tear off, with a rude hand, the thin veil of ideality that 'shadowed its form though not concealed,' and drag it bare before the public, shorn of the finer, higher, purer emotions that sentiment has so intimately associated with it, and stripped of all imaginative charm. This he assuredly has done. It is true that Whitman is a son of the people, and has naturally missed the refining influences of early associations; but then one is forced to remember another son of the people, Robert Burns, and one involuntarily thinks of his</p><p>'O, my Love's like a red, red rose, <br>That's newly sprung in June:<br>O my Love's like a melodie<br>That's sweetly played in tune,'</p><p>when one comes to lines like these,\u2014verses they can scarcely be called:</p><p>'Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturned love.<br>But now I think there is no such thing as unreturned love; the pay is certain <br>one way or another.<br>(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was unreturned,<br>Yet out of my love have I written these songs.)'</p><p>Or put this beside it, so full of spontaneousness and the emotion of the hour.</p><p>'O, wha can prudence think upon,<br>And sic a lassie by him?<br>O, wha can prudence think upon,<br>And sae in love as I am?'</p><p>But it is not only to noble or graceful ideas, but to worthy expression of them as well, that poetry owes its power and charm; and it is in this sense of form that Walt Whitman is so essentially lacking. A poet must be an artist, as well as a man of imagination, and however much of an outlaw or rebel he may be in spirit, must submit himself to the laws of his art. Methods he must have though they be of his own choosing, and the man of genius always recognizes the necessity of such restraints. A poet who absolutely ignores the charm of verse, has missed the secret of his art. An English poet who neglects the language of poetry, which is something set apart from the common terms of daily speech, and by preference employs the most hackneyed, prosaic literal expressions of everyday life, has no sense of the sacredness of poetry. When one thinks of what real poetry is, one has hardly patience with a man who could offer the public lines like these, and call them poetry:</p><p>'I tucked my trowser-ends into my boots, and went and had a good time.'</p><p>'Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well then I contradict myself.<br>(I am large, I contain multitudes.)'</p><p>'I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet besides.'</p><p>'I assert that all fast days were what they must have been,<br>And that they could no-how have been better than what they were,<br>And that to-day is what it must be, and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than what they are.'</p><p>Could indifference of ideas and contempt of form be carried further than this?</p><p>In Whitman's case, it is especially unfortunate that he should have failed to conceive of poetry as an art, for every now and then one comes across a burst of something that might have been poetry, and fine poetry too, if it had been shaped by an artist. There is this from the 'Song of Myself':</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing night.<br>I call to the earth and the sea half held by the night,<br>Press close, bare-bosomed night\u2014press close, magnetic, nourishing night!<br>Night of the south-winds\u2014night of the large few stars!<br>Still, nodding night\u2014mad, naked summer night.'</p><p>There are passages of this quality scattered through the volume in 'Drum Taps,' 'Sea Drift,' 'From Noon to Starry Night,' but they shine like oases among weary pages that are an inextricable tangle of incoherent emotions, epithets, invectives, detached thoughts, inconsequent reflections, un-analyzable, divigations, that spread in straggling unmetrical lines. The author of Leaves of Grass entirely lacks, or has never cultivated any sustained power of construction, and the fact that he has been taken so seriously in Europe is partly due to his astonishing egotism, his defiant tone and fierce assertion of his own individuality, and partly to the undiscriminating manner that prevails in certain English literary circles to find something that shall be unmistakably typical of the new civilization of the crude Western world, something that might pass for the poetry of the self-made man.</p><p>It is not from an ethical standpoint, not from narrow, conservative prejudice, that Walt Whitman's insistent realism is inevitably condemned, but from the vital principles of his art, which it offends beyond reconciliation.

There ever will be a divided opinion, probably, as to Whitman's claim to rank as a poet. Certain is it that he discards all the canonical rules pertaining to composition, and gives just the expression, regardless of 'feet,' that answers his thought's need. Much of his work, therefore, seems but the record of ideas in the baldest of prose. Here and there is a sentiment embodied which touches the highest poetic afflatus. Yet with a feeling throughout that conventional 'poetry' has all been derided, we find many passages that bear reading again and again, and their strength grows upon one as familiarity is achieved. The author seems to us to be laboring with great thoughts, which he must indite at once to rescue from oblivion, with purpose later to set their excellence in flowing rhyme. They are rough diamonds of poetic thought awaiting the inspired lapidary's skill. The 'fleshly' pieces, of which so much has been said, and which endangered the circulation of the book hereabouts, are to our mind but beatific adorations of the great gift of maternity, and to the purist can be as welcome as the nude statue. With the limitations of our civilization, however, there are but few purists, and the intent of the author can easily be misunderstood by very excellent people, and wholly perverted by the depraved. They are not necessary to any representation of the force or originality of the writer, and as they offend large sections of the community, and furnish prurient curiosity with food for lascivious thought, they had better, as Mr. Emerson originally suggested, be curtailed, if not wholly omitted.

This one on 'Leaves of Grass' I heard him give myself, while I was in Boston, and it determined me to buy the book; and now I feel that I want every mother in the land to own the volume and love it. To own it and read it will be to love it. I wish I had room to quote all of Chainey's lecture, but a part must suffice.</P><p>'Whitman found that he had to chant the glory of the body as well as that of the soul.

In doing this, he finds it impossible to leave out of his poems the element of sex. I know of nothing that we need to pay such heed to as to what he has to say on this subject. Never will the world be saved from its sickness, pain, and despair, until we take up this element of human life, and treat it as frankly, purely, and reverently as he has. As he says:</p><p>'Sex contains all.<br>Bodies, souls, meanings, proofs, purities, deli-<br>cacies, results, promulgations.<br>Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal <br>mystery, the seminal milk.<br>All hopes, benefactions, bestowals.<br>All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of <br>the earth,\u2014<br>These are contained in sex as parts of itself, <br>and justifications of itself.'</p><p>'Of course, in the treatment of such a subject there must be expressions used that impure minds will prostitute to impure purposes. The fairest, purest, and most beautiful things on this earth are so violated. As Hamlet said to Ophelia, 'Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.' We all know that depraved passions sometimes break down all the barriers of virtue, and do violence to the most maidenly chastity. It is the same low order of morals that thus seeks to drag into the mire the noblest thought and purest purpose of the best benefactors of humanity. The spirit and purpose of Whitman are clearly revealed in the only reply he has yet made to his maligners and persecutors. He tells us that this subject of sex has hitherto been treated of only in two ways. The first, the conventional one of total repression and silence of good folks, creating the feeling that what can not be spoken of must be vile, and so, by covering over disease and depletion, increasing the world's woe. The second is the coarse, vulgar way of speaking of these things that obtains current in many masculine circles, wherein men lose their respect for women, and hold in low esteem their own manhood through learning to take delight in vulgar stories.</p><p>'Alas! we all know that this is true. Thus, the parlor and the barroom have formed a partnership for the propagation of vice. The first doubt lodged in my mind against the claims of the Christian Church and ministry was the first time I spent an evening in the company of three ministers. I expected innocently that the conversation would be on the subject of religion and touching the advancement of the Church. To my surprise and horror, they spent the whole time in regaling one another with smutty yarns. I never was made to blush so much for the company I found myself in before or since. I soon found, however, that this was quite a common practice in the ministerial profession. At camp-meetings, while one or two of their number are thundering at better men and women than themselves to repent or go to hell, the rest are secluded in their private tent, regaling one another in this fashion.</p><p>'Thinking what he might do to reform these perverted tendencies, Whitman concluded that the time had come for a full and frank statement, in loftiest and most earnest manner, of the relation of sex to the health, sanity, and purity of the human race. He desired to connect it with the highest ethical expression of nature and humanity. How nobly and grandly he has done this, none but those who read and love his poems can feel.'</p><p>I could give you a long array of worthy names indorsing and eulogizing this beautiful work, but instead of the names I give you from the book itself.</p><p>'A child said, What is the grass? fetching it, <br>to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?

That event has now at length taken place (though not, it seems, without unforeseen difficulty of some kind, marked by a long interval between the advertisement and the appearance of the volume, and by a change of publishers apparently at the last moment), and London can at length supply us from its own resources with copies of Leaves of Grass, under which title the author apparently now wishes to include all his poetical works up to the present time.* We are presented at the same time with another work of the same author, the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass (published 1855 in a thin quarto, type set up by the author himself), which is now not easily to be met with. This preface was not reprinted in subsequent editions, but was prefixed with some omissions by Mr. Rossetti to his volume of selections. For what has been given us we must be thankful, though we may mildly complain that Whitman's other prose works, consisting of two books\u2014one a magnificent political prophecy, and the other a personal narrative of deep interest\u2014are apparently to be withheld from the English reader, though long ago advertised as published or to be published in company with the preface afore-mentioned. Even in America, says a personal friend of the author, these books can hardly be said to have been published, though readers occasionally find them out, and certainly in England they are little enough known. The reader at the British Museum may find there a copy of Democratic Vistas, but he will search in vain for Memoranda during the War.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, a real service has been rendered to us by the publication in London of Leaves of Grass, and against the printing of the volume there is nothing to be said; it is, in fact, a fine specimen of typography, with few apparent misprints, excellencies which no doubt are fully appreciated by the author, who knows practically what printing is. For those who are acquainted with previous editions of the poems this publication has an interest of its own quite apart from the fact that it is the first complete English edition. There are poems contained in it which have either never appeared before, or only in a separate form not readily to be obtained in this country, as, for instance, the 'Song of the Exposition,' 'After all not to create only,' with its funeral chant for feudalism, which has passed now to its charnel vault\u2014</p><p>Coffin'd with crown and armour on,<br>Blasoned with Shakespere's purple page<br>And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.</p><p>There are also throughout the poems changes of title, omissions, and corrections, such as the author continually makes in his works, for, rough as they seem and often are, the roughness is not caused by want of revision; and, finally, the poems are rearranged, sometimes under new heads altogether, such as 'Autumn Rivulets,' while 'Passage to India' remains only as the title of a single poem, which in 1872 gave its name to a whole volume. But to mention these in detail, and to estimate the effect of them taken together, would be impossible without assuming in the reader a previous knowledge which in most cases he would not possess. We must confine ourselves at present to more general considerations.</p><p>Whitman has been the object of a good deal of enthusiastic and rather undiscriminating admiration, and also of a certain amount of furious and equally undiscriminating abuse. Neither is deserved, but he lays himself open, it must be said, almost equally to both. It is time, however, that an attempt were made to arrive at a sober estimate of his real value; and to the formation of such an estimate those should contribute who, having carefully considered the writings of the man, feel his influence strongly indeed, as all such will, but are not overpowered by it, and see his great merits plainly without being thereby prevented from seeing plainly also his great excesses and defects. A few of such critics have already essayed the task, but it will hardly be said that there is no room for more.</p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>It is said, and, so far as I know, said truly, that this prophet is not honoured in his own country. This does not mean that his books have not been bought and read: indeed, the number of copies sold of the first editions of Leaves of Grass is to me rather a subject of surprise. Astonishment at the audacity of the venture must have had some share in raising the public interest, for the book unquestionably sold well. Nor does it mean that the merit of the author was quite unrecognized: on the contrary, by some who were most competent to judge, he was estimated at a very high value. 'The most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed' was Emerson's verdict on the book, and Thoreau thought he saw something almost more than human in the personality of the man. But the mass of his countrymen were not and are not strong enough to accept him; they have perhaps too little confidence in their own literary originality to appreciate duly one from among themselves who breaks through all the conventional usages of literature; they have too much squeamish delicacy to admit to their society one who is so brutally outspoken and unrefined. It is necessary perhaps that this writer, for we need not be zealous to claim for him the title of poet, should be first accepted in the Old World before he can be recognised by the New, which at present can see nothing in literature but by reflected light. Strange irony of fate, if such should be the destiny of one who cast off the conventional forms in order to free himself and his country from Old World influences! 'The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.' This he has said and still believes, waiting in confidence for that proof of his title to be forthcoming. But there are many reasons why he should be slowly if at all admitted to his rights, whether in Old World or in New, and to glance at some of these reasons before we proceed further will not be amiss.</p><p>He is perhaps of all writers the most repellent to the reader who glances at him superficially. In the first place he is indecent, and that too not accidentally but on principle. Whatever may be thought of his morality, and that I hold to be essentially sound and healthy, it cannot be denied that in one section of his work, and occasionally throughout the poems and prose, he outrages every ordinary rule of decency. There is nothing impure in this kind of exposure; it has indeed the direct antithesis to prurient suggestion, and the intention of it is unquestionably honest, but from an artistic point of view it is the gravest of faults, it is essentially and irredeemably ugly and repulsive. We are most of us agreed that there is and ought to be a region of reticence, and in to this region the writer had rushed himself and drags us unwillingly after him. He stands convicted of \u0313\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1, if of nothing worse. Akin to this first instance of defect in artistic perception is a second\u2014his use, namely, of words which are either not English or essentially vulgar; and to this must be added a not unfrequent neglect of syntax, which, together with looseness in the application of some words, makes him at times vague or unintelligible. Occasionally there occur words or expressions which, though not ordinarily found in literature, have a native force which justifies them; but generally it is the case that for the French word or for the vulgarism savouring either of the gutter on the one hand or of the Yankee penny-a-liner on the other might be substituted a good English word equally expressive. But here also we too probably have before us a fault of willfulness, for we know that he will not allow the language of English literature to be large enough for the poets of America, but expects accessions to it from Tennessee and California. If, however, he has in his choice of words sought that simplicity which (to quote his own words) is 'the art of art, the glory of expression, and the sunshine of the light of letters,' he has certainly not seldom failed to attain it, and it was hardly to be attained by pouring out indiscriminately into his pages the words which ran naturally off his pen. The 'art of sinking' is illustrated in his juxtaposition of the most incongruous things, and this especially in his well-known catalogues, which, though sometimes picturesque and interesting, are generally only absurd and dull. The fact that they are introduced on principle is not to be admitted as an excuse for the inartistic and formless character, any more than a similar excuse is to be allowed for offences against decency. From many of these faults a sense of humour would have protected him; and this also might have preserved him from some of that violently feeble exaggeration with which he speaks especially of his own countrymen and their institutions, and from the parade with which he sometimes announces truisms, as if they had been just now for the first time discovered by himself. His defence on the general charge is finely given in a poem now published for the first time, written in Platte Ca\u00f1on, Colorado.</p><p>Spirit that formed this scene,<br>These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked freshness,<br>These formless wild arrays . . .<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten art? . . .<br>But thou that revelest here, spirit that formed this scene,<br>They have remembered thee.</p><p>But the grandeur of nature is not always to be attained by heaping together uncouth masses. We complain not so much that the work lacks polish, as that the writer has not been preserved by his own native genius from ugly excrescences.</p><p>These artistic defects and his general disregard of form make many of his works repulsive, and do not allow us to accept any one as faultless. But they are mostly such as expurgation could remove, and therefore are not vital. The characteristic which cannot be got rid of, and yet repels, is his intense egotism and self-assertion. His longest, and in some respects most important, work\u2014a poem of twelve or fourteen hundred lines, with which the original Leaves of Grass opened\u2014has or had his own name as the title\u2020 and his own personality as the subject; and this self-assertion of the individual is perhaps the prevailing characteristic of Whitman's work, that which makes it in fact representative in some degree of the spirit of the age; and the egotism, after all, is not so much personal as typical. The poet is a Kosmos, and contains within himself all unity and all diversity. What he claims for himself he thereby claims for others on the same terms. 'Underneath all, to me is myself, to you yourself.' We feel when the poet proclaims himself 'an acme of things accomplished,' for whose birth all the forces of the universe have been a preparation, he is speaking less for himself individually than for humanity, the humanity of his own day and of future days. The egotism becomes more offensive when it is obviously personal and indicates himself as the Michael Angelo of literature; and that, it must be admitted, is not unseldom, though here too he claims to be speaking less for himself than for the future of democratic poets. To these charges it may be added that, notwithstanding his boasted freedom from the trammels of conventionality, he is in his more ordinary work a mannerist of the most vulgar kind. 'Oh! to realise space!' 'Have you reckoned a thousand acres much?' 'Has any one supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die.' 'I have said that the soul is not more than the body, and I have said that the body is not more than the soul.' 'I swear I think there is nothing but immortality, that the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it!' If these are not all exact quotations, every one will recognise them as genuine types. No style lends itself more readily to parody and burlesque. But when he is at his best the mannerism is in a great measure shaken off.</p><p>The disregard of metrical uniformity is another fact which is observed by the most superficial reader, and probably repels him, but with far less reason than the points above mentioned. It is not indeed correct to say that 'there is no trace of rhyme or metre' in these poems. There is at least one poem which affords an instance of perfectly regular metre and rhyme throughout, and in another the regularity in these respects is all but complete; while in some others, such as 'Pioneers' and the 'Dirge for two Veterans,' though there is no rhyme nor an absolute uniformity in the length of lines, there is a stanzaic uniformity, which satisfies, or almost satisfies, the conventional expectations. As for the rest, some is quite formless; but for the most part there is a strongly marked and characteristic rhythm, not strictly metrical, though with metrical tendencies, nor properly to be called the rhythm of prose. It has rather the monotony of a chant than the varied tones of the best rhythmical prose, though it must be said that it not only resembles but is identical with the early prose rhythm of the same author.\u2021 Every reader of the preface before us will perceive this; and we are relieved from the possibility of doubt by the fact that passages from this preface have been introduced word for word, or with insignificant changes, into subsequently published poems, being divided stichometrically into lines by the natural pauses of the sentence. The words which he himself uttered in this preface on the subject of the rhythmical uniformity are among the best which have been spoken on that subject yet, and no apology is needed for quoting them.</p><p>The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or uniformity. . . . but is the life of these and much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and the uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of material laws, and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts, and oranges, and melons, and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems, or music, or orations, or recitations are not independent but dependent. . . . Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.</p><p>It has been said already that though Whitman's lines are not ordinarily metrical, yet they have metrical tendencies, and this will readily be perceived by any one who reads them aloud. The prevailing rhythm is dactylic. Every reader of Whitman will recognise as characteristic the following examples, chosen purely to illustrate the movement:\u2014</p><p>Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;<br>When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side that day,<br>One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall never forget;<br>One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,<br>Then onward I sped in the battle. . . .</p><p>Or again\u2014</p><p>It is well\u2014against such I say not a word, I am their poet also;<br>But behold such swiftly subside, burnt up for Religion's sake;<br>For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the earth,<br>Any more than such are to Religion.</p><p>Not unseldom we find regular or slightly irregular hexameters, sometimes several in succession, and occasionally also pentameters, e.g.\u2014</p><p>Do you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded?</p><p>Or,</p><p>Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierced with missiles I saw them,<br>And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody.</p><p>Or again (an elegiac couplet)\u2014</p><p>Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence equidistant<br>Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.</p><p>But these are accidents. Let me call the reader's attention to one form of this rhythm which is doubtless the result of design, the occasional lengthening of line in passionate lyrical outbursts, which produces sometimes a remarkable effect of intensity in that it 'crowds and hurries and precipitates' the notes in the eagerness as it were of the verse to find a cadence.</p><p>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would.</p><p>From these dactylics we pass to the inspiriting trochaics of 'Pioneers,' and finally, as the poet grows graver in the more deeply spiritual songs of the soul and of death, which are among his last productions, with the rapid flow of the earlier rhythm mingles the graver tone of the iambic, as in the remarkable poem called 'Passage to India.'</p><p>Passage indeed, O soul, to primal thought,<br>Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,<br>The young maturity of brood and bloom,<br>To realms of budding bibles.</p><p>Or again, in the still more recent 'Song of the Redwood Tree'\u2014</p><p>Nor yield we mournfully, majestic brothers,<br>We who have grandly filled our time;<br>With nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,<br>We welcome what we wrought for through the past,<br>And leave the field for them.</p><p>But enough of the outward form; it is time that we examine more closely the value of the contents.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>If we were asked for justification of the high estimate of this poet, which has been implied, if not expressed, in what has been hitherto said, the answer would be perhaps first, that he has a power of passionate expression, of strong and simple utterance of the deepest tones of grief, which is almost or altogether without its counterpart in the world. Not often has he exerted his power, but often enough to let us understand that he possesses it, and to stamp him as a poet inferior to few, if any, of our time in strength of native genius, however he may fall behind many in artistic perception. Two poems of death, indicated often by himself as the highest theme, though not faultless, for none of his work is so, are enough in themselves to rest his claim upon. The first is 'Out of the Cradle endlessly rocking;' and the other that funeral hymn for President Lincoln which begins, 'When Lilacs last in the Door-yard bloomed.' Nothing illustrates more strongly than these two poems the intense sympathy of the writer with nature, animate and inanimate, and the deep emotional significance which it has for him. Both are saturated with influences of sky, sea, or forest. The first is of the ocean, whose husky meaning is a fit accompaniment to the song of desolate loneliness; the second is of the forest, whose pine-fragrance is as the perfume of the sweet soul that is gone. In both the most passionate outpourings come forth in the notes of birds\u2014the mocking-bird, the most magnificent of songsters, and the hermit thrush, the grey-brown minstrel of the cedar swamp, lyrical mourners whose chant is fused and translated into words by the ecstatic listener. Shelley's skylark pours forth a harmonious madness of joy, Keats' nightingale seems to be intoxicated with passionate yearning; but never before has a bird poured forth to a poet a song so capable of stirring the depths of emotion in the heart, as heart-breaking indeed in its intensity of grief, as that of the lone singer 'on the prong of a moss-scalloped stake, down almost among the slapping waves.' The burden of the first division of the chant is 'Two together.'</p><p>Shine! shine! shine!<br>Pour down your warmth, great sun!<br>While we bask, we two together.<br>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,<br>Day come white or night come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,<br>Singing all time, minding no time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Such is the joyous and careless song of the two feathered guests on the seashore of Paum\u00e1nok, when the snows had melted and the lilac scent was in the air, while every day the boy, curious but never disturbing them, peered cautiously at the he-bird flitting to and fro, and the she-bird 'crouch'd on her nest, silent with bright eyes,' till on a sudden, 'may-be killed unknown to her mate,' she disappeared, nor returned that day nor the next, nor ever appeared again. And thenceforward all the summer, day and night over the surging of the fierce mother the sea, the boy hears at intervals the solitary one who is left.</p><p>Blow! blow! blow!<br>Blow up, sea winds, along Paum\u00e1nok's shore,<br>I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.</p><p>Often the child, gliding down to the beach, had stood with bare feet, the wind wafting his hair, with 'the white arms out in the breaker tirelessly tossing,' to listen and translate the notes of the demon or bird.</p><p>Soothe! soothe! soothe!<br>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,<br>And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close,<br>But my love soothes not me, not me.<br>Low hangs the moon, it rose late,<br>It is lagging\u2014O I think it is heavy with love, with love.<br>O madly the sea pushes upon the land,<br>With love, with love.<br>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?<br>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?<br>Loud! loud! loud!<br>Loud I call to you, my love!<br>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves.<br>Surely you must know who is here, is here,<br>You must know who I am, my love.<br>Low-hanging moon!<br>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?<br>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!<br>O moon, do not keep her from me any longer.<br>Land! land, O land!<br>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would,<br>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>But soft! sink low!<br>Soft! let me just murmur,<br>And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea,<br>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,<br>So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,<br>But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.<br>Hither, my love!<br>Here I am! here!<br>With this just-sustained note I announce myself to you,<br>This gentle call is for you, my love, for you.<br>Do not be decoyed elsewhere,<br>That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice;<br>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;<br>Those are the shadows of the leaves.<br>O darkness! O in vain!<br>O I am very sick and sorrowful.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!<br>In the air, in the woods, over fields,<br>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!<br>But my mate no more, no more with me!<br>We two together no more.</p><p>It stirs the boy's heart, and he feels that it is toward him and not really toward its mate that the bird sings, and a thousand echoes have started to life in his soul.</p><p>O give me the clew! (It lurks in the night here somewhere),<br>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!<br>Whereto answering, the sea,<br>Delaying not, hurrying not,<br>Whispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,<br>Lisped to me the low and delicious word death,<br>And again death, death, death, death,<br>Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,<br>But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,<br>Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,<br>Death, death, death, death, death.</p><p>This is the only solution of the cries of unsatisfied love, and here lies the highest problem which awaits the poet always with its unconquerable, almost unassailable, mysteriousness. This word it is which he gives as the key to the thousand responsive songs awakened in him from that hour, the word which the sea whispered, 'like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside.'\u00a7 'Whispers of Heavenly Death' is the title of one section of these poems, and it is the 'Carol of Death' which forms the centre of the second of the two poems to which attention has not been called. Splendidly imaginative is this 'nocturne,' with its three ever-recurring chords, 'lilac, and star, and bird.' Of more intricate construction than the other and less directly passionate, because expressive of a more reflecting sorrow, it is yet a composition which few can read or hear unmoved.</p><p>Ever-returning Spring, trinity sure to me you bring,<br>Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,<br>And thought of him I love.</p><p>The star is disappearing in the black murk of clouds, while cruel hands hold him powerless; but his senses are steeped in the perfume of the lilac and the song from secluded recesses, 'death's outlet song of life,' of the singer among the cedars, while 'over the breast of the spring,' through lanes and through streets of cities,</p><p>Passing the yellowspear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark brown fields uprisen,<br>Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,<br>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,<br>Night and day journeys a coffin.<br><p>To the coffin that slowly passes, with the great cloud darkening the land, with the people's mourning and 'the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,' he brings a sprig with its flower broken from the lilac bush, with its delicate blossoms and heart-shaped leaves. Nor for this coffin alone, but for all he would bring blossoms and branches and chant a song 'for you, O sane and sacred Death.' This, after all, was what the great star must have meant a month since\u2014</p><p>As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,<br>As you drooped from the sky low down as if to my side, while the other stars all look'd on,<br>As we wander'd together the solemn night (for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep).</p><p>But he is drawn by the song of the bird, though for a moment he lingers, detained by the star, his departing comrade, and by the mastering odour of the lilac. Sea winds blown from east and west, from the Atlantic and from the Pacific, shall be the perfume for the grave of the man he loves. Pictures of growing spring 'with flood of the yellow gold of the gorgeous indolent sinking sun,' of all the scenes of life in country or city of this varied and ample land, these shall adorn his burial house. But over all these falls the dark cloud,</p><p>And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.<br>Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,<br>And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,<br>And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,<br>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,<br>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,<br>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.</p><p>The bird sang the 'Carol of Death.'</p><p>Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.</p><p>The hearer stands rapt by the charm and holding as if by the hand his mystic companions, while the sight that was bound in his eyes 'unclosed, as to long panoramas of visions.' He sees the vision of armies, of battle flags borne through the smoke, of the corpses of all the slain soldiers of the war, and he sees that they were not as had been thought.</p><p>They themselves were fully at rest, they suffered not;<br>The living remained and suffer'd.</p><p>Passing from the visions and from the song, he unlooses the hold of his comrades' hands, and leaves the cedars and the lilac with heart-shaped leaves; yet each and all he keeps.</p><p>The song, the wondrous chant of the grey-brown bird,<br>And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,<br>With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe,<br>With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,<br>Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep, for the dead I loved so well,<br>For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands\u2014and this for his dear sake,<br>Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,<br>There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The passage from the region of pure imagination and passion to the other works of the same writer compels us to deal with his religious and political philosophy. In religion, if he is to be labelled with a name, it must be perhaps 'Pantheist;' he is an exponent of 'Cosmic Emotion.' 'I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand not God in the least.' It is the contemplation of 'the fathomless universe,' and all its movements and rests, its organic and inorganic existences, which stirs the religious emotion in his soul. Men are inclined to cry, 'What is this separate nature so unnatural? What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth without a throb to answer ours, cold earth, the place of graves).' To answer this question is the function of the poet, to soothe 'the sad incessant refrain, Wherefore, unsatisfied soul? and Whither, O mocking Life?' His answer is, 'Bathe in the Spirit of the Universe, intoxicate thyself with God.'</p><p>Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time, and Space, and Death, like waters flowing,<br>Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,<br>Whose air I breathe, whose ripples bear, lave me all over,<br>Bathe me, O God, in thee, mounting to thee,<br>I and my soul to range in range of thee,<br>O Thou transcendent,<br>Nameless, the fibre and the breath,<br>Light of the light, shedding forth universes. . . .<br>Thou pulse, thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,<br>That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,<br>Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,<br>How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak, if out of myself<br>I could not launch to those superior universes?</p><p>God, as he includes all, includes personality, and from God will come somehow a satisfaction of the longing of the soul. What conclusions, if any, are to be drawn from the alteration in the new edition of the poem called 'Gods,' I leave it to the curious to consider; but in it clearly, as elsewhere, we find anticipation of the</p><p>Lover divine, and perfect comrade,<br>Waiting content, invisible yet, but certain,</p><p>of whom, whether he be ideal or real, we cannot pronounce.</p><p>About immortality he doubts, yet strongly believes. In moments of cool reflection he feels that the questions of 'identity beyond the grave' is the great unsolved problem. Yet his poetical optimism continually leads him to assert immortality, and that not merely the merging of our life in the vital forces of the universe, though that is sometimes his meaning, but actual personal identity of the human soul after death. We have, on the one hand, among his first utterances\u2014</p><p>I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love;</p><p>and, on the other hand, we have later the picture of the chamber of death, where</p><p>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the corpse;</p><p>and again the cry\u2014</p><p>If maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are betrayed,<br>Then indeed suspicion of death.</p><p>On the whole he seems to become more definite as he proceeds, in his anticipation of 'identity after the grave.' As for defined creeds, it is not they which give the life;</p><p>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they are shed out of you.</p><p>God and the soul are not to be argued about;</p><p>Logic and sermons never convinces;<br>The damp of the night strikes deeper into my soul.</p><p>But religion is the thing above all, and he rarely fails to point the way to spiritual meanings.</p><p>His morality is almost comprised in the one word 'health,' health of body and health of soul, the healthy and sane man to be the ultimate standard. These are Greek ethics, and the maxim on which they seem to be based\u2014</p><p>Whatever tastes sweet to the most perfect person, that is finally right\u2014</p><p>is thoroughly Aristotelian. A 'sane sensuality,' as it is called by one of his friends, is a necessary part of the ideal man. The body is sacred as well as the soul, and to assert is sacredness is the purpose of his sometimes outrageous physiological details, which can hardly have the desired effect, but are clearly not meant, nor indeed adapted, to minister to vicious tastes; they may disgust, but they can hardly corrupt. There is indeed something in this tearing away of veils which, however justly it may offend true modesty, is to unhealthiness and pruriency as sunlight and the open air; they shrink from the exposure, and shiver at the healthy freshness; it is not an atmosphere in which they can long survive: mystery is the region in which they thrive, and here all mystery is rudely laid bare. This man's nature is itself as healthy as the sea, which endangers not us with all the fevers deposited in it.</p><p>His judgment of actions is rather aesthetic than strictly moral, and he admires the unconscious blossoming out of good and kindly deeds more than all the moral struggles which proceed from religious introspection. He envies the careless rectitude of the movements of animals who are placid and self-contained, and do not 'sweat and whine about their condition.' He is sure that good deeds have their happiness in themselves and not in any external or future reward, and that bad deeds have their misery in themselves and not in any external or future punishment.</p><p>The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him;<br>The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him;<br>The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him;<br>The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him;<br>The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him, it cannot fail.</p><p>And again of a future life\u2014</p><p>I have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us changed;<br>I have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and past law,<br>And that murderers, drunkards, and liars shall be under the present and past law,<br>For I have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough.</p><p>But underlying all, so far as he himself is concerned, is a sympathy embracing all human beings, however vile, and all animals and plants, however irresponsive. It is this which leads him at times to emphasise his own sensuality, that he may make himself the equal of the most depraved, to draw them if it may be in the bonds of sympathy to himself. It is this which is the open secret of that magnetic influence which he is said to exercise over those whom he casually meets. It was this which led him to the hospitals rather than to the field of battle, and makes him recall in memory now the experiences of the 'Dresser,' rather than the great battles and sieges at which he was present. No study of the poet would be complete which did not include the section of his work which deals with the war and after, which indeed contains some of the most magnificent and spirit-stirring trumpet-blasts, as well as some of the most deeply-moving aspects of suffering and death ever expressed by poet. Here was a great theme, and he treated it nobly; with all notes of patriotism and devotion to the flag is beautifully blended sympathy for the vanquished, and deep desire to relieve the sufferings of the wounded. On the whole no part of his work is more interesting than this; it is as if he were the born poet of emancipation, tender to all suffering persons, yet with nerve strong enough to endure without fainting or shrieking the stroke of necessary surgery. Magnificent is his war cry, as in the 'Song of the Banner at Daybreak,' and his note of triumph, 'The war is completed, the price is paid, the title settled beyond recall;' yet finer still is the 'Vigil on the Field of Battle,' the memories of the hospital tent with its long row of cots, the vision of the Mother of All gazing desperate on her dead, the reflection on those 'Camps of Green' where friend and foe without hatred sleep, and need not any longer provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign, nor drummer to beat the morning drum. Other things, too, he gathered from the experiences of the war: he gathered from them more than from all else the steadfastness of his belief in democracy, in the nobleness and courage of common men. But to speak of this would belong rather to a review of the Democratic Vistas, which is not my task; the poetical aspects of the theme are enough. The poet then believes in the power of sympathy, but he believes also in individuality 'underneath all\u2014individuals.' At least half his work is devoted to the assertion of this, and yet with this sympathy and 'adhesiveness' is to go hand in hand, and he has as his watchword still the word of democracy, the word En-masse. The reconciliation is to be found in the prose more clearly than in the verse, but Whitman is not over-anxious for reconciliation; he is large, he contains multitudes, and has room for contradictions.</p><p>Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well then, I contradict myself.</p><p>That being so, his optimism is the more comprehensible; and it is upon a basis of optimism after all that he builds his whole religion and philosophy. He has too firm a grasp of fact to ignore the existence of evil. If he exclaims at times, 'There is no evil,' he adds, 'or if there is, it is just as important to you as anything else.' 'I am not the poet of goodness only; I am just as much the poet of evil.' But he believes that evil is transient and relative; he holds that the drift of things is towards good; that all is, not at once, but finally for the best. This he said, in plain prose, is the growing conviction of his life, and in verse, of the souls of men and women going forward along the roads of the universe,</p><p>They go, they go, I know that they go, but I know not where they go,<br>But I know that they go forward toward the best.</p><p>This it is which makes him so much at peace about God and about death. 'No array of words can describe how much I am at peace about God and about death;' the heroic failures of this world are to him eternal successes. 'Battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won;' therefore, 'Vivas to those who have failed!' And above all the cause of liberty will finally succeed.</p><p>Revolt! and still revolt! revolt!</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>When liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go nor the second or third to go,<br>It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.<br>When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,<br>And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth,<br>Then only shall liberty, or the idea of liberty, be discharged from that part of the earth,<br>And the infidel come into full possession.</p><p>Too much, perhaps, has been said of the religion and morality of the poet, and too little of the literary aspect of his works. But this it is difficult to illustrate sufficiently by quotation, and impossible to set forth without illustration. It seemed to me that suggestions of the drift of the whole were more likely to be useful than attention to particular points. Everyone will remark first the too frequent infelicity of sentiment and phrase, and then the striking directness of utterance, and the stumbling, as if by accident, on the absolutely best words in the absolutely best order, which characterises his finest work. Whether these be truly poems, or fine imaginings only, we need not be much concerned to inquire. His own claim to be the poet of America is based on other than purely literary grounds.</p><p>Give me the pay I have served for,<br>Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest.<br>I have loved the earth, sun, animals; I have despised riches;<br>I have given alms to everyone that asked\u2026.<br>I have dismissed whatever insulted my own soul or defiled me body,<br>Claimed nothing to myself which I have not carefully claimed for others on the same terms,<br>Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every state,<br>(Upon this breast has many a dying soldier leaned to breathe his last).</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Say, O mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?<br>Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?</p><p>G.C.

BUCKE, M.D. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>IN a letter dated Concord, 6th May, 1856, Emerson wrote to Carlyle:\u2014'One book, last summer, came out in New York, a nondescript monster which yet has terrible eyes and buffalo strength, and was indisputably American, which I thought to send you, but the book throve so badly with the few to whom I shewed it, and wanted good morals so much, that I never dxml:id. Yet I believe now again I shall. It is called Leaves of Grass, was written and printed by a journeyman printer in Brooklyn, New York, named Walter Whitman; and after you have looked into it, if you think, as you may, that it is only an auctioneer's inventory, you can light your pipe with it.'</p><p>The book referred to was a copy of the singular looking thin quarto volume of little more than a hundred pages, in which the Leaves of Grass originally appeared, and which is now so eagerly sought after by American book-collectors. What Carlyle's opinion of it was, whether, as Emerson thought he might, he used it for the purpose of lighting his pipe, or like Emerson, he held it in high esteem for its intrinsic excellence, we have no means of knowing. In the recently published Carlyle-Emerson correspondence there is no further reference to it, and so far as we can remember, no allusion is made to it in any of Carlyle's published writing.</p><p>The reception which this strange 'nondescript monster['] with 'terrible eyes and buffalo strength' met with at the hands of the public and in literary circles was almost as disheartening as possible. Of the thousand copies printed, some, Dr. Bucke informs us, were given away, most of them were lost, abandoned, or destroyed.\u2217 According to Mr. Burroughs, some sixty copies were deposited for sale in a bookseller's shop in Brooklyn, and as many more in another in New York. Weeks elapsed and not a single copy was sold. Presently there came the request from both the booksellers that the unfortunate thin quarto should be removed. Subsequently the copies found refuge in the warehouse of a phrenological publishing establishment in Broadway, the proprietors of which advertised the work, and sent out copies for review and to distinguished persons. 'The journals,' continues Mr. Burroughs, 'remained silent, and of the copies sent to distinguished persons several were returned with insulting notes. The only reception heard of, was such, for instance, as the use of the volume by the attaches of a leading daily paper in New York\u2014collected in a swarm Saturday afternoon, waiting to be paxml:id off\u2014as a butt and burlesque, whose perusal aloud by one of the party, the other lounging or standing about, was equivalent to peals upon peals of ironical laughter from the whole assemblage.\u2020 Cold as its reception by the press was, it was scarcely so silent, however, as Mr. Burroughs' words might lead the reader to suppose. As we learn from Dr. Bucke's extremely useful and handy little volume, it was noticed, though certainly in no very complimentary terms, in the Brooklyn Daily Times, in the London Critic, and in the New York Criterion. Nor was it altogether ignored in higher quarters. It had the honour of being reviewed in Putnam's Magazine, then the most influential and best conducted of the American periodicals. The reception given to it there was probably under the circumstances the best possible. The reviewer filled three columns with extracts from its pages, selecting the most original and striking passages, and passing over those which were calculated to offend, and though he pronounced the new poems to be a 'mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism,' which were here 'seen to combine in harmony,' and indulged in other pleasantries of a similar nature, he frankly acknowledged that there were to be found 'an original perception of nature, a manly temper, and an epic directness in the new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school.'</p><p>That any warmer or more encouraging reception should have been accorded to the book was scarcely to be expected. Its singular appearance, its peculiar lines, its utter want of conformity with most of the conventionalities of the poet's art, the obscurity of its author, and above all its seeming want of good morals were against it. Circumstances, however, soon conspired to lift both the volume and its author, if not out of derision, at least out of obscurity. The first and most weighty was the publication of a letter to Whitman from Emerson in which he declared the Leaves of Grass a 'wonderful gift,' and pronounced it 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' 'I give you joy,' he wrote with his usual cheeriness, 'of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things saxml:id incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.    .   .   .  The solxml:id sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Thoreau wrote of the book in a similar, if more guarded, strain. 'On the whole, it sounds to me,' were his words, 'very brave and American, after whatever deductions. I do not believe that all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in this land, put together, are equal to it for preaching. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He sometimes suggests something a little more than human.' By these and other means public attention was gradually directed to the volume: and when at length a new and enlarged edition appeared in 1856, it awoke a perfect storm of derision and abuse. Indeed, so extreme were the feelings it excited, that, according to Dr. Bucke, a number of persons in New York seriously contemplated instituting proceedings against its author in the courts of law, and were only deterred by the consxml:ideration that, whatever might be the estimation in which his book deserved to be held, Whitman himself was so popular in New York and Brooklyn that it would be impossible to get a jury to find him guilty. But the best piece of good luck that befell Whitman was his dismissal in 1865, by Mr. Harlan, formerly a Wesleyan clergyman, but at the time secretary for the Interior, from a government clerkship he had obtained, on the ground of the alleged immorality of Leaves of Grass. This act at once put the climax to the discussion as to his merits and demerits, and aroused an intense curiosity respecting his volume, and not a little sympathy in his favour.</p><p>On Whitman himself the derision and abuse, which were heaped upon him in true Philistine fashion, had, and have had, little or no permanent effect. Least of all, have they induced him to modify the principles with which he started on his literary career, which, as Emerson rightly divined, 'had a long foreground.' Having carefully settled his principles at the beginning, Whitman has steadily adhered to them, never doubting, and never having the slightest misgivings as to their soundness. Respecting the matter in which he has applied them\u2014a very different thing\u2014he has now and again had serious doubts.</p><p>'Since I have been ill,' he writes in a note to the Preface of 1876, 'I have felt temporary depression more than once, for fear that in Leaves of Grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced.' But in his clearest and calmest moods he has always realized, he tells us, that as the Leaves surely prepare the way for morals and necessitate them, and are adjusted to them just as nature does and is, so they are what, consistently with his plan, they must and should be. The scorn which he naturally felt towards his detractors was mainly of the silent sort. He neither sought to defend his reputation, nor to retaliate on those by whom it was so savagely assailed; nor dxml:id he care much whether he was understood or not. In a poem which does not seem to have been included in the earliest edition, and which is in some respects characteristic, he writes:\u2014</p><p>'I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or to be understood;<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise;<br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all),</p><p>'I exist as I am\u2014that is enough:<br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;<br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content;</p><p>'One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;<br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million <br>years,<br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p><p>'My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution;<br>And I know the amplitude of time.'</p><p>This bold and almost arrogant confxml:idence is now apparently being justified. Though not popular in the sense that he is wxml:idely read, or that his works are to be found, as Whittier's are saxml:id to be, in almost every house in the United States, Whitman has on the American continent a large and increasing circle of readers. Outsxml:ide of America his admirers are more numerous still. Like Fourier, he may be saxml:id to have his propagandists in many lands. On the continent of Europe some of his works have been translated into several languages, while in England, where his worth was early recognised, he has secured the warm, and on the whole judicious advocacy of poets and critics like Swinburne, Buchanan, W.B. Bell, W.M. Rossetti, Symonds, and Professor Dowden, and of his popularity amongst ourselves not the least significant sign is the publication of the two handsome volumes, the titles of which we have placed first at the head of this paper.</p><p>In these volumes is contained, it would appear, all that Whitman desires to be preserved of his published writings. The one bearing the title Specimen Days and Collect is, with the exception of one or two juvenile pieces, in prose, and as the title indicates, is of very varied contents. First of all, we have a number of pages in which Whitman gives an account\u2014an account, we may remark in passing, which is not without interest\u2014of his ancestry and early days. Next, we have a number of memoranda written during the war of attempted secession, and here copied verbatim from a series of 'soil'd and creas'd livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket,' and 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain,' having been 'hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom admit the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march.' The memoranda here given from these 'lurxml:id and blood-smutch'd little note-books' bear all the marks of their origin. They are written in swift, vigorous, telling words; while the intense realism by which they are pervaded, and the terrible scenes which they depict, often make their reading exceedingly impressive. Following these, and forming the concluding part of the Specimen Days, is a number of memoranda written during and after the author's recovery from a serious and prolonged illness, brought on by his exertions during the war, and consisting, for the most part, of descriptions of natural and human scenes. They are full of fine thought and feeling, and are frequently not less poetical than some of the finer passages in his poems. In the Collect are included the remarkable essay entitled 'Democratic Vistas,' the prefaces to the various issues of his poems, and a paper on 'American Poetry.'</p><p>Whitman's prose is, in our opinion, not equal to his verse. Passages of great beauty and power occur; but taken as a whole the style is less terse and vigorous. It is marred, too, by mannerisms, and particularly by the frequent occurrence of long and often clumsy parentheses. As a rule the shorter pieces are written in much sounder and healthier English than the longer, though some of these are admirably written, and lead one to suspect, as a not unfriendly critic has observed, 'that his every-day prose is distorted intentionally.' For a right understanding of Whitman's poetry, however, a careful study of his prose writings, and more especially of the section having the somewhat strange, though not all together inappropriate, designation of 'Collect,' is indispensable. It is here that he explains himself, and unfolds the aims and principles by which he is guxml:ided and inspired.</p><p><em>Leaves of Grass</em>, originally, as we have remarked, a thin quarto of about a hundred pages, has now grown into a goodly sized octavo of nearly four hundred closely printed pages, containing close upon three hundred separate poems. Whitman has given regular titles to comparatively few of them. Most of them are headed instead with their first line or phrase, as, e.g. 'As I pondered in silence,' 'I hear America singing,' 'When I heard at the close of the day.' The greater part of them are distributed under the headings\u2014'Inscriptions,' 'Children of Adam,' 'Calamus,' 'Birds of Passage,' 'Sea-drift,' 'By the Roadsxml:ide,' 'Drum-taps,' 'Autumn Rivulets,' 'Whispers of Heavenly Death,' 'From Noon to Starry Eye,' 'Songs of Parting.' Unconnected as they seem, however, it must not be supposed that they have no connection or are without arrangement. Though without formal connection, they have one which is real, and are intended to be read in the order in which they stand, as what may not unfitly be called an Epic of Life. On first reading, as most readers will probably acknowledge, they are somewhat repellent. There is so much in them we do not expect to find, so little respect is paxml:id to our conventional xml:ideas, and the author obtrudes himself so ostentatiously upon our attention, that after a few lines, we are disposed to throw the book asxml:ide as a compound of egotism and nonsense. On further reading, however, the illusion is gradually dispelled. First the attention is arrested by single lines or isolated passages, and as we proceed we become aware of an intellectual wealth and suggestiveness, a subtle charm, a personal force, a rush and glow of overmastering passion which we have seldom met with elsewhere; and though there are passages from which we turn away with repugnance, we cease to wonder at the warm and extremely eulogistic terms in which the admirers of Whitman are in the habit of speaking of him.</p><p>But whatever our estimate of Whitman's writings may be, Whitman himself is unquestionably a notable figure, certainly one of the most notable America has produced. As Professor Dowden has remarked,\u2014'What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass, is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-word clay nor cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timxml:idly from behind his work to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am, a solxml:id and not inconsxml:iderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications; he attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love: or our extreme repugnance. However we feel toward him we cannot despise him. He is a 'summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be gotten rxml:id of. Passed by he cannot be.'\u2021 Nor are the sources of this singular power far to seek. They are to be found not so much in his art, for as an artist he is in some respects confessedly weak, but in the lofty purpose by which he is inspired, and in the ardent, and almost fierce enthusiasm with which he has from first to last devoted himself to it. This purpose, to put it in the fewest words, is nothing less than to inaugurate in America, by means of a genuinely native imaginative literature, a new era of intellectual and spiritual development. Or to put it differently, and to use the eloquent words of W. M. Rossetti, he 'occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one\u2014a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the continent, or the Washington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America.' This purpose is surely a noble one, and which, if at all seriously followed, cannot fail to be fruitful in extraordinary power. And that this is the purpose which Whitman has continually set before him he has frequently declared. 'Democratic Vistas,' his various Prefaces, and several other of his prose essays may be taken as a sort of apology justifying it. But, nowhere has he given more noble utterance to it, as Mr. Rossetti has also pointed out, than in the following lines:\u2014</p><p>'Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,<br>I will make the most splendxml:id race the sun ever shone upon,<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades,<br>'I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, <br>and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,<br>I will make inseparable cities with their arms around each other's necks,<br>By the love of comrades<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>'For you, these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!<br>For you, for you, I am trilling these songs.'</p><p>Besxml:ides an 'imperious conviction and the commands of his nature as total and as irresistible as those which make the sea flow, or the globe revolve,' Whitman's incentives to this great and unquestionably beneficent task are partly in the condition of American society, and partly in the character of American literature.</p><p>The spectacle presented by American society he describes as 'appalling.' Everywhere he sees hollowness, hypocrisy, deceit; in the business classes a depravity 'infinitely greater than has been supposed;' 'corruption, falsehood, and maladministration in branches and departments of the official services, whether national, state, or municipal;' in 'fashionable life flippancy, tepxml:id armours, weak infxml:idelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time;' 'in literature a scornful superciliousness;' 'in the churches and sects the most dismal phantasms usurping the name of religion.' 'The best class we shew,' he writes, 'is but a mob of fashionably-dress'd speculators and vulgarians.' Though an unwavering believer in democracy, and joyfully recognising the 'immense success of the New World democracy in lifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain species of intellectual culture,' he is nevertheless painfully oppressed by the conviction that so far 'in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, esthetic results, it is almost a complete failure,' 'in vain, he exclaims, 'do we march with unprecedented strxml:ides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annexed Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north to Canada and south to Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.' Or take the following passage from the 'Democratic Vistas,' which, while it illustrates his style in prose writing, clearly indicates one at least of the reasons why he has devoted himself to his self-imposed task:\u2014</p><p>'Let me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations, localities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition. After an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bays, sparkling sea txml:ides, costly and lofty new buildings, facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich ships, the wharves, the great Central Park and the Brooklyn Park of hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)\u2014the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters\u2014these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my sense of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the east and north rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in the Wall Street, or the Gold Exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas\u2014but in the artificial, the work of man, too, is equally great\u2014in this profusion of teeming humanity\u2014in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships\u2014these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p><p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real importance, personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask\u2014Are there, indeed, men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Is there a great moral and religious civilization\u2014the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infxml:idelity\u2014everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe\u2014everywhere an abnormal libxml:idinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood decreasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (consxml:idering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p><p>Turning to the literature of America, any 'breath recuperative of sane and heroic life' to breathe into these lamentable conditions, Whitman nowhere finds. That which he observes to be everywhere lacking is native or original power. Workers in a certain sort of literature he sees in abundance; but 'touched by the national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality, they wither,' he affirms, 'to ashes.' 'I have not seen,' he remarks, 'a single writer, artist, lecturer, or what not, that has confronted the voiceless, but ever erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the land, in a spirit kindred to itself.' And, again, 'consxml:idered with reference to purposes of patriotism, health, and noble personality, religion, and the democratic adjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic plays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of our best xml:ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish no one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no one, and suffice only the lowest levels of vacant minds.' Morally and artistically, he affirms, America has as yet originated nothing. 'We see the sons and daughters of the New World,' he observes, 'ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the universal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and the dead. We see London, Paris, Italy\u2014not original, superb, as where they belong, but secondhand here, where they do not belong. We see the shreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks, but where on her own soil do we see, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.' The central point of a nation, and that whence it is swayed and sways others, that which consolxml:idates its various parts, and is the source at once of its inspiration and influence, is, he believes, its national literature, and more especially its archetypal poems, but any such literature or poems America, he maintains, does not possess.</p><p>What then is the literature he desires and to what extent has he realised this desire in his own works? The answer to the first of these questions the foregoing paragraphs have already suggested. Those who wish for a fuller and more explicit answer we must refer to Specimen Days and Collect, and more especially to the 'Democratic Vistas,' the Prefaces of 1855 and 1876, and to the essay on 'Poetry To-day in America\u2014Shakespeare\u2014The Future,' where Whitman has unfolded his xml:ideas at consxml:iderable length, and frequently with great eloquence and power. In the space now remaining at our disposal we shall point out one or two of the features of the literature he has produced, premising, however, that many of the questions we shall be obliged to pass over in silence.</p><p>Whitman's principle defect, as a poet, lies, as it seems to us, and as we have already saxml:id, in the direction of his artistic power. That which strikes the reader first on opening Leaves of Grass is the singular appearance of its pages. The ordinary forms of versification Whitman has discarded, and adopted in their stead one which reminds us of Ossian, the writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the Vedas. By his thorough-paced admirers this is claimed as a sign of originality and strength. In our opinion, it is a sign of weakness. A really great poet, one, that is, who is thoroughly perfect in all the branches of his art, is a master of expression. Whitman confessedly is not. After many trials he was forced, he tells us, to give up the attempt to express himself in the forms employed by the great poets of the principal literary nations, and to use the mode he has here adopted. There is running through his works, as Mr. Rossetti has very truly remarked, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical movement and a sustained melody which are admirable, as for example\u2014'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,' 'O Captain, my Captain,' 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed.' These, however, are exceptions. Generally speaking, Whitman's lines are deficient in melody. Music of a certain kind they certainly have; but they want the measured cadence, the flowing melody, that exquisite rhythmical charm which makes the words of the great poets take hold of the mind and live in the memory as the sweetest strain of a noble song. Nor can it be saxml:id that by adopting this peculiar mode of versification Whitman has secured any advantages superior to those afforded by the ordinary forms. That he has obtained a greater freedom may probably be admitted; but it is questionable whether it is not at the expense of effectiveness. To take but a single illustration. The thought of the following is admirable:\u2014</p><p>'There was a child went forth every day:<br>And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;<br>And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part <br>of the day,<br>Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years<br>         .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .     <br>  The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt-marsh <br>and shore-mud;<br>These become part of that child who went forth every day, and <br>who now goes, and will always go forth every day.'</p><p>But compare with it Wordsworth's treatment of the same theme:\u2014</p><p>'The stars of mxml:idnight shall be dear<br>To her: and she shall lean her ear<br>In many a secret place,<br>Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br>And beauty born of murmuring sound<br>Shall pass into her face.'</p><p>Whatever may be saxml:id in favour of Whitman's treatment, the advantages, so far as general effectiveness is concerned, are plainly with Wordsworth. The last two lines, besxml:ides having a fulness and suggestiveness about them quite equal to all that Whitman has saxml:id, or has attempted to say, have a music and a charm of expression on which the ear delights to dwell. Whitman's neglect of the art of expression is calculated, we think, to tell greatly against him. That he is capable of great things in this way we do not doubt. The poems referred to above, and others we could name, are a proof of the consummate work he might have done, had he been less impatient of restraint and more devoted to the perfecting of his skill in what is in reality one of the main sources of the poet's power. It must not be supposed, however, that Whitman is indifferent to the charms of art, or that, in his revolt against conventionalism, he has no rules or principles of his own. To those who imagine so we commend the perusal of what follows from the Preface of 1855:\u2014</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity\u2014nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the road-sxml:ide, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of some flowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writings any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. What I tell I tell precisely for what is. Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my sxml:ide and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>In 'Children of Adam,' Whitman has sinned, we think, against good taste, common sense, and, in fact, as one of his critics has pointed out, against one of his own canons. True, he has probably violated no moral law, and has simply spoken of what nature permits. It is true also that according to Schiller, whatever nature permits, is permitted also to art. Still, there are some things on which men have agreed to be silent, and though we are by no means disposed to regard conventionality as the standard of morals, we cannot avoxml:id the conviction that by speaking of the sexual relations in the way in which he has, Whitman has violated a natural instinct of the human mind. That he is an immoral writer, as some of his critics have maintained, we do not believe. His fault is one of manner rather than of spirit, and has its origin in an error of judgement rather than in a wrong bias of the mind. His deepest spirit and highest aim are, it seems to us, religious; and nothing, we imagine, but a strong sense of duty could have made him withstand so patiently and persistently the fierce storm of invective and abuse which some of his poems have aroused against him.</p><p>Whitman's faults, however, are greatly outweighed by his merits. First we may notice that in spirit he is intensely American. In the poets of other lands he is evxml:idently well read; yet, he is an imitator of none. His manner, style, and spirit are entirely his own. Previous to him the poetry of American was, as has been justly observed, merely the poetry of apt pupils, with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. The poems of Bryant and Longfellow might have been written as easily on the banks of the Thames as on the banks of the Hudson. There is little in them that is distinctively American. Whitman's poems, on the other hand, are saturated through and through with the spirit of the New World. 'Starting from Paumanock,' 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,' 'A Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Broad Axe,' 'A Song for Occupations,' 'Pioneers! O Pioneers!' 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' 'Drum-taps,' and 'Sea Drift,' it may be safely saxml:id, could not have been written elsewhere than on the American Continent, or by one whose spiritual life had not been reared among its people, and nourished by a life-long communion with its magnificent natural phenomena. Whitman is American also in another sense. He is thoroughly democratic. The Presxml:ident is no more to him than a mason, or woodsman, or western farmer. Any breath of a political aristocracy, of feudalism, or of caste, is not allowed to taint his pages. Their xml:ideas and institutions are entirely alien to his spirit. He could no more have written the xml:idylls of the King, or a play of Shakespeare than he could have written the Iliad. The doctrine which he preaches on every page is the greatness of the indivxml:idual soul. While Spencer writes 'to fashion a gentleman or nobleperson in virtuous and gentle discipline,' Whitman writes to build up a new and splendxml:id race of average men. As a poet of Democracy, as Democracy exists in the New World, he stands alone.</p><p>'The messages of great poets to each man and woman,' he has remarked, 'are, Come to us on equal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you. What we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy.' Of his own poems, this is a marked feature. Their directness is unquestionable. They place the reader on a level with themselves, and make him feel that he is being addressed by one who is of the same flesh and blood as himself, by one whose thoughts and feelings are, or may be his own. And the reason is that, subjective as Whitman's poems are, and distinctively as they teach the doctrine of indivxml:idualism, they always rest on that which is universally human. Perhaps no other poet of the present has a larger vision of that 'great human heart by which we live,' or more persistently announces it. The 'self' of which he sings is not always his own indivxml:idual self; as frequently, if not more so, it is the universal self, that universal being of which each indivxml:idual is but a conscious manifestation. Of this any one can convince himself by a careful reading of the 'Song of Myself.' Take, for instance, the following lines:\u2014</p><p>'I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning <br>and the end.<br>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now;'</p><p>or take the lines with which the song opens:\u2014</p><p>'I celebrate myself, and sing of myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belongs to me as good as belongs to you;'</p><p>or these:\u2014</p><p>'The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br>The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,<br>The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps <br>by his wife;<br>And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br>And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>And of these one and all I weave the song of myself,'</p><p>This mysticism, indeed, forms the background of all Whitman's more important pieces, and is the key to their meaning. Without a clear apprehension of it it is impossible to understand the paradoxes in which his pages abound, or to reconcile his apparent contradictions. Were it not that we have Mr. Burroughs' assertion to the contrary, we should have attributed Whitman's mysticisms to a close study of Emerson. It seems, however, that before he published the first edition of the Leaves of Grass, Whitman had never read Emerson at all, and that he dxml:id not become acquainted with the Essay until the following summer. The similarity of their xml:ideas is remarkable, and may probably be taken as significant of the tendency of American thought.</p><p>Whitman is pre-eminently a poet of the modern world. No other has more thoroughly adopted the conclusions of science, or made a more splendxml:id and impressive use of them in his writings. Not unseldom they give a vastness and grandeur to his thought, which is well-nigh overwhelming. At the same time he is very far from being in any sense or degree a materialist. The supremacy of the spiritual he always loyally, and sometimes ostentatiously, recognises. Though almost Greek in his sympathy with nature, and notwithstanding the manner in which he has sung of man's physical constitution, the position which he assigns to the soul is always incomparably higher, as the following from his Preface of 1876 clearly shows:\u2014</p><p>'Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a higher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too) the spiritual the religious\u2014which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred-fold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the divine, and of the xml:ideal, through mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the objective worlds\u2026 To me the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendxml:id theology, and for ampler and diviner songs.'</p><p>Still, notwithstanding his modern tone of thought, and the democratic spirit which pervades his writings, the past is by no means disdained by Whitman. Past, present, and future, he holds, are not disjoined but joined. The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been. The present, he affirms, is but a stage in the eternal process of creative thought, and is what is through the past. At the same time, however, while admitting his indebtedness to the past, and claming kinship with it, he asserts also his independence, and claims to stand in his own place with his own day about him:\u2014</p><p>'I conn'd old times,<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.<br>In the name of These States shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophers, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, investors, governments long since<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted<br> hither<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it)<br>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more <br>than it deserves,<br>Regarding it all intensely a long while, then dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place with my own day here.'</p><p>We are warned, however, that our space is already exhausted, and can refer to but one other of the many features of Whitman's poetry. After pointing out that formerly he was consxml:idered the best poet who composed the most perfect work, or the one which was most complete in every respect, Sainte-Beuve has remarked that for us in the present the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's imagination and reflection; not he who has done the best, but he who suggests the most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, who leaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in your turn.' Judged by this standard Whitman deserves to take a place among the foremost. His works are preeminently suggestive. Any finished picture he seldom presents. His poems are rather suggestions, arousing the reader, and leading him on and on, till he feels the fresher air of a freer thought breathing around him, and sees spreading out before him the limitless and unknown.</p><p>'I but write one or two indicative words for the future,<br>I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.<br>I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a <br>casual look upon you, and then averts his face,<br>Leaving it to you to prove and define it,<br>Expecting the main things from you.'</p><p>To the religious spirit which breathes through Whitman's writings we have already referred; and our assertions on this point have been borne out by several of the passages we have cited for other purposes. Dxml:id our space permit, numerous other passages might be cited as bearing directly upon it. But as a last word, and as indicating with consxml:iderable fullness the scope and spirit of all that he has written, we transcribe the following:\u2014</p><p>'And thou America,<br>For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality<br>For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.</p><p>'Thou, too, surroundest all,<br>Embracing, carrying, welcoming all, thou, too, by pathways broad and <br>new,<br>To the xml:ideal tendest.</p><p>'The measur'd faith of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,<br>Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,<br>Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,<br>All eligible to all.</p><p>'All for immortality,<br>Love like the light silently wrapping all,<br>Nature's amelioration blessing all,<br>The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,<br>Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening.</p><p>'Give me, O God, to sing that thought<br>Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,<br>In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,<br>Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,<br>Health, peace, salvation, universal.</p><p>'Is it a dream?<br>Nay, but the lack of it the dream?<br>And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,<br>And all the world a dream.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217P. 183.</p><p>\u2020Notes on Walt Whitman, pp. 15-16.</p><p>\u2021Studies in Literature, 1789\u20131877, p. 473.</p>", "date": "September 1883", "year": 1883, "creator": "William Musham Metcalfe", "publication": "The Scottish Review", "citation": "Metcalfe, William Musham [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman.\" September 1883.

It contained several selections from the book which induced a feeling of utter bewilderment. Since that time I have read sundry other compositions of the 'good gray poet,' and always the effect has been the same. As one stumbles through the uncouth chants, the mixed metaphors, the hirsute style, the ragged similes, and the rickety grammar of the 'Leaves of Grass,' he begins to feel that he is lost in a wild jungle, and must trust to luck to get out. The ordinary compass will avail him naught. The poet must be judged by none of the received standards.</p><p>In a recent issue of a New York journal, Walt Whitman casts a backward glance on his own road. Even in this sketch, it is no easy task to divine what he is driving at. His vagueness of style and elusiveness of thought pervade even this prose article in which he endeavors to set forth some of the motives and theories involved in his 'Leaves.' Criticism on that extraordinary production has taken the shape of indiscriminate eulogy, or has confined itself to a condemnation of the glaring vulgarity of the book. This general arraignment of the work for its immorality has probably been the cause of its sale. Let it be announced that the author has expunged from it all the unseemly passages, and he will find that it will very soon die. Walt Whitman has been chanting his own praises so long, and has made such noisy claims for his writing, that a criticism of his 'Leaves' may not be untimely. There is still considerable curiosity about him and his book, and some sort of settled opinion should be reached and a verdict pronounced upon the worth of his alleged poems. If they are rubbish, it is well enough to say so.</p><p>In his latest article Mr. Whitman says:</p><p>'Many consider the expression of poetry and art to come under certain inflexible standards, set patterns, fixed and immovable, like iron castings. To the highest sense, nothing of the sort. As, in the theatre of to-day, 'each new actor of real merit (for Hamlet or any eminent r\u00f4le) recreates the persons of the older drama, sending traditions to the winds, and producing a new character on the stage,' the adaptation, development, incarnation, of his own traits, idiosyncrasy, and environment,\u2014'there being not merely one good way of representing a great part, but as many ways as there are great actors,'\u2014so in constructing poems.'</p><p>There are certain inflexible standards for fine art and poetry as well as for the stage, and the wings of genius have never lagged because of them. An actor recreates Hamlet by his personal magnetism, his subtler grasp of Shakespeare's meaning, his finer mastery of motives underlying the character, and his ability to project an animated, picturesque portraiture upon the sensibilities of the audience. Suppose, however, he undertook to play the part in a cutaway coat, a plug hat, corduroy trowsers, and green stockings; suppose he interpolated modern 'gags' in the soliloquies, or recited 'To be or not to be' while standing on his head! He would be original, but intolerable. However great might be his genius, however fiercely he might cast stage traditions to the winds, there are certain standards he could not destroy. He would have to preserve the dignity of the character, its psychological prominence, its intensity, and its morbid intellectuality. In literature it is the same. Standards of some kind must ballast the writer, or he may go on to Ursa Major. There are two kinds of literature,\u2014prose and poetry; and, as Monsieur Jourdan says, everything written is either one or the other. Unless some kind of metrical arrangement is observed by a writer, then his production is prose. Emerson is allowed to diverge widely from ordinary rhythm, but no one doubts that he has written poetry. Whitman claims that his 'Leaves' are poems, using the word in the old Greek sense, probably. It is hard to admit that the 'Leaves' are either prose or poetry. Nothing but a purgatory of their own is adapted to their reception. They are literary mermaids, without the legendary interest associated with those mythologic characters.</p><p>But Mr. Whitman says 'no one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt at such performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or aestheticism. I hope to go on record for something different\u2014something better, if I may dare to say so.' No one is likely to insist that the poet aimed very sedulously at art; but if 'Leaves of Grass' is not a literary performance, what is it? It is surely not a scientific treatise nor a passage of music. It is a literary work, and when Mr. Whitman does not want it judged as such he appears in the part of the man endeavoring to escape the issues he himself has forced. There are curt, balky, uneasy writers who bring us divine messages in their ungraceful way; they leave with us burning thoughts leading to higher resolves and splendid aspirations. Their style may be deplorable, but we understand them. We know that they bear a message to us, and do not expect from them facility of verse or even pliancy of language. Their meaning is clear, their thought sharply outlined, their purpose tangible and coherent.</p><p>Is Mr. Whitman such a writer? Most assuredly he is not. While it would be unfair to him to judge his work by the 'set patterns,' it is certainly allowable to look at it from the standpoint of common sense. We have a right to insist that all reputable work shall have a meaning, and it is permissible to criticise its aim, to show where it has failed or succeeded, to point out its beauties or its defects. It is true that the violet-ink novelists, like Howells and James, decry all purpose in literature; but their own productions are sufficient refutation of their theories. The man who writes or acts without a purpose is a fool.</p><p>What is the raison d'etre of 'Leaves of Grass'? Has the author ever stated in intelligible English the purpose of his book? Is its aim moral, political, scientific, aesthetic? Is it written in the interest of democracy, or of the intellectual classes? Very likely its author would claim that its purpose is collective. Has it inspired any one with greater love for humanity; has it caused the torch of patriotism in the hand of any individual to burn the brighter; has it lifted a single soul from its despair; has it brought sunshine to any heart; has it given new hopes; has it sweetened religion; has it encouraged science; has it given new wings to the imagination; has it led the intellect into new paths of light and knowledge; has it cleared up any of our doubts or thrown the slightest ray of helpful light upon our questionings? If it has done none of these things, the reason of its being is not apparent.</p><p>But, some of Mr. Whitman's admirers say, it is written from a democratic stand-point. If this is the case, the people ought to be able to understand it; but the ordinary man would regard 'Leaves of Grass' as the production of a maniac. Only the 'gifted few' can discover any sense in 'Leaves of Grass'; and what particular message they get from it is past the comprehension of one of the ungifted many. The work, of course, is defective in its literary form. Even its author admits that. Moreover, it has the faults of bad grammar, incomplete sentences, misuse of words, and incoherence of ideas. There is about as much consecutiveness in the 'Song of Myself' as there is in a dream originating in too much shrimp salad for supper. A transcript of the dream would be as valuable as the 'Song of Myself.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman says that 'the volumes were intended to be most decided, serious, bona fide expressions of an identical individual personality\u2014egotism if you choose, for I shall not quarrel about the word.' In this connection, Mr. Whitman quotes a saying of Carlyle's, that 'there is no grand poem in the world but is at bottom a biography\u2014the life of a man.' It is noticeable here that Carlyle does not say an autobiography. Mr. Whitman is mistaken. The 'ego' is usually voted a nuisance in fiction and works of imagination. And it is just as well for us to continue setting down as a vain and disagreeable fellow the man who speaks always of himself as if he were the universe. Egotism hardly does justice to Mr. Whitman's condition. It should be termed the delirium of self-conceit.</p><p>The 'Song of Myself' is probably a fair sample of Walt Whitman's style and purposes, and there is no injustice in judging him by it. If the critic or the laborious reader were to devote himself to this 'poem,' what would he find in it? I will attempt a partial summary of it. He begins by saying 'I celebrate myself and sing myself.' After celebrating and singing himself, he continues: 'I loafe, and invite my soul.' We may define him then to be a sort of loafer-poet. Having shown that he is not too much of a loafer to be a poet, and vice versa, he continues: 'I harbor for good or bad. I permit to speak at every hazard nature without check, with original energy.' In other words, he erases the words restraint, modesty, and shame from his vocabulary, and drops the distinction between decency and indecency. He would confound all our previous conceptions of good and evil; and, if his theory were carried out, where would be maidenly modesty and youthful delicacy? He might as well contend that everybody should forswear clothes and strut about in puris naturalibus. The poet begins his pilgrimage in houses full of fragrance; then he goes out in the air to the bank by the wood and becomes undisguised and naked. 'I am mad,' he says, 'for the air to come in contact with me.' This is the language of the lunatic asylum rather than that of poetry. Then follows an enumeration of abstract and concrete things, about which he predicates nothing. It reminds one of the negro's story of the storm that blew down the house but left the roof standing. The poet fails to provide an adequate support for his words, but leaves them suspended in mid-air. After he has made mincemeat of these barbaric phrases, he says: 'Stop this day and night with me, and you shall possess the origin of all poems.' In the phantasmagoria that follows, if the reader can discover the origin of anything, he is entitled to it. Whitman continues:</p><p>'There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now;<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there now.'</p><p>This is the climax of nonsense, and carries one back to the alleged philosophers who claimed that motion was an impossibility, and pain a myth. What becomes of evolution, progress, civilization? There could be no more depressing belief than this, for it means nothing but universal death. Fortunately, it is disproved by science, by history, and by religion. After winging his way through another space of inky obscurity, the poet says: 'The unseen is proved by the seen, till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.' Now what does this mean? He starts out with the seen, which needs no proof, and establishes from it the unseen. So far, it is clear; but now the seen becomes unseen, and receives proof in turn. Proof of what? That it is unseen. The necessity for proving the unseen is not apparent. If the poet intends to convey the idea that there is an invisible order of things, an unseen universe, why does he not say so? And if he did, it is not a matter of proof or demonstration, but of hope and conjecture. His dictum is mere verbal jugglery.</p><p>The poet then exalts his body, and this physical delirium runs all through the song at intervals; but there is no new and divine message here. The doctors tell us that the body is not vile, nor any of its parts; and when a genuine poet called it the temple of God, he said all that was necessary to say concerning it. Whitman 'believes in the flesh and the appetites,' meaning libidinous desire. In this respect he is not unlike the libertine. Indeed, this 'Song of Myself' is the chant of the rou\u00e9. Resuming, he enumerates the people around him, the events happening about him, the battles, the feelings, anything and everything that chances to run in his mind, and concerning them all he says:</p><p>'These come to me days and nights, and go from me again,<br>But they are not the Me myself.'</p><p>Has this passage any meaning? Whitman says he is not a battle, or a fever, or a dress, or a dinner, or a compliment. Neither is he a pancake, a turnip, or a sardine. If he means that his soul stands apart from and uncontrolled by matter, why not say so? If he means the contrary, why not say so? If he means that he is a mere isolated spectator of human events, is it not easy enough for him to make his meaning clear to the average intellect?</p><p>Then he announces to his soul that he believes in it, and goes on to chant: 'Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,' etc. Naturally, one would infer that he was still addressing his soul. If so, he becomes ridiculous; for he gives the soul a throat and a voice. When we read farther we find he is addressing some one else, but whom we cannot divine. He says:</p><p>'I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning,'</p><p>etc. The matter that follows is too vulgar for quotation. The passage is simply nauseating and devoid of sense.</p><p>The next incident is a child's bringing him a handful of grass, and asking him what it is. Of course, he does not know, but he proceeds to make up a wild 'yawp' about it, nevertheless; and he drifts next to the subject of death, and says it is as lucky to die as to be born, and he knows it. For one, I don't believe he knows anything of the kind. He says:</p><p>'I am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;<br>I am the mate and companion of people, all just as<br>Immortal and fathomless as myself;<br>(They do not know how immortal, but I know).'</p><p>Nor is he a comet, a meteor, or a ring of Saturn. 'They do not know how immortal they are, but I know,' is evidently regarded by him as a valuable bit of confidence. The plebian mind, however, will wonder how there can be degrees of immortality. We could just as well ask how long a man would live if he lived forever.</p><p>Now follows another jungle of people and things, which he says are for him; but he omits to say why they are 'for him,' and what he intends doing with them. Let us catalogue them in regular order: Male and female, boys, those that love women, the proud man, the sweetheart, the old maid, mothers, mothers of mothers, lips, eyes, children, the baby, the youngster, the red-faced girl, the suicide, the corpse, the blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of promenaders, omnibus, driver, sleighs, clank of horses, jokes, snow-balls, hurrahs, the mob's fury, flap of litter, a sick man, meeting of enemies, oaths, blows, a fall, crowd, policeman, stones, groans, exclamations, speech, arrests, slights, assignations, rejections, etc. The writer gives us here a bare enumeration of living beings, inanimate objects, abstractions, that have no bearing on each other, obey no sequence, and teach no lesson. An inroad into Mitchell's geography would be far more significant and useful. As a description of a street scene it is lame, hueless, and unnatural.</p><p>The bard's next transition is to the country; but he fails to give us any connecting links to show whence he went, why he went, or whither he went, though he does not fail to tell us what he did when he got there. He did exactly what one would expect him to do, after one has read the 'Song of Myself' up to this point. Instead of acting as a rational man, he 'jumps from the cross-beams of the wagon, seizes the clover and timothy, and rolls head over heels and tangles his hair full of wisps.' This kind of individual would jump out of a third-story window, instead of contenting himself with viewing the prospect through it. He is next hunting out in the wilds; then he is at sea; then at a clambake; then at the marriage of a trapper and an Indian girl. A runaway slave comes to his house and sits next to him at his table. This episode fixes his attention for a moment, and his mind wanders again, and he sees twenty-eight young men bathing by the shore\u2014</p><p>'Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:<br>Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.'</p><p>In the next paragraph the poet says:</p><p>'She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;<br>She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window.<br>Which of the young men does she like the best?<br>Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.<br>Where are you off to, lady? for I see you;<br>You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.<br>Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;<br>The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.<br>The beards of the young men glistened with wet, it ran from their long hair:<br>Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.<br>An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies;<br>It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.'</p><p>Who they are, what they have to do with the poem, how they could lead twenty-eight years of 'womanly' life, what difference it makes whether they were so friendly and so lonesome or not, how they could be so lonesome if there were twenty-eight of them, and how they could be so friendly if they were all lonesome, are a few of the riddles suggesting themselves to the mind of the unbeliever in reading this passage. It has been suggested to me that the paragraph is intended as a picture of twenty-eight women who are lonesome because deprived of the society of twenty-eight men who are accustomed to associate together to the neglect of the women; but the phrase 'twenty-eight years of womanly life' is hardly synonymous with 'twenty-eight women.' And who is this mysterious 'she,' and what is she doing? Is she engaged in the unmaidenly act of watching the men bathe? If there is a suggestiveness here except the suggestiveness of an unclean mind, it is not apparent.</p><p>By this time the reader is in a positive whirl; but the poet continues to exhibit his wax-works, and introduces the butcher-boy, the blacksmith, and possibly the baker and the candlestick maker. He next sees a negro driving a dray, and from him he goes by the usual degrees to the wild gander leading his flock. A little further on, 'the pure contralto sings in the organ loft,' and 'the carpenter dresses his plank.' Another convulsion seizes the writer at this juncture, and he gives us a catalogue of all sorts of people and professions. He jumps from a steam-boat to a ball, from one of the seasons to one of the States. At one time he is in Missouri, and at another in a street-car. There is no telling where he will alight next.</p><p>It would not be profitable to carry the analysis further. It is evident that the 'Song of Myself' leads nowhither, and that it is the unsystematic, unpruned expression of a very peculiar mind. A few more quotations may be pardoned, as showing to what extremes language can go. For instance, this abrupt paragraph:</p><p>'Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?'</p><p>It is, of course, impossible for the reader to say who goes there. Possibly he doesn't care. As for the second question, that may be respectfully referred to the physiologist, who can answer it to any man's satisfaction. One fails to see what the bard is hankering after, and why he is nude. The connection between his being mystical and his eating beef is also a mystery, from which he has not lifted the veil. Again he says:</p><p>'I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth.'</p><p>In one place he says, 'I know that I am deathless,' and in another declares himself a materialist. He speaks of the sea as the 'howler and scooper of storms.' He finds the scent of the armpits 'aroma finer than prayer.' These quotations might be strung out endlessly, but they would afford merely cumulative proof of the rankest kind of rebellion against common sense. It is not to be denied that at times the reader detects the gleam of the diamond in this mass of rubbish. The poet has evidently thought and read of many things, but his comments convey a hint of indigestion. When one finishes reading the 'Song of Myself,' it is impossible for him to give a rational review of what it is, and what it is intended to teach. It is a failure, because the writer has neglected that very art which he professes to despise. The word 'art,' which is as wide in its significance as the heavens, has often been degraded by careless thinkers into a synonym of form, when it is in reality the execution of truth. Thought is never valuable unless it is clear and comprehensible. An obscure thought is hueless, tasteless, and devoid of nourishment. If Mr. Whitman's thinking is obscure, it is not worth the preserving. On the other hand, his thoughts may be true and clear, but he may lack fitting expression, just as a man may have a perfect conception of harmony and have no voice for song. It is in giving adequate, tangible expression to clean, valuable thinking, that the writer or poet justifies himself. He should have something to tell, and he should tell it. Unless he can do so, he has no business posing as a poet. Shakespeare found the English language and the established modes of composition spacious enough for his transcendent genius. Cicero, Virgil, and Horace were not trammeled by the polished completeness of Latin. Dante could express all his thoughts in artistic Italian, while Goethe and Schiller never thought of rebelling against the rules of German grammar and the accepted modes of composition. The man who has a story to build will never fail for want of verbal tools; if he falters, it will be because he knows not how to use them. If he has a message to deliver, wings are convenient; but he must know how to fly with them. We have a right to insist that a definite subject or story shall be selected, and that it shall be developed artistically, and in such a way as to be grasped. When Wagner, the musical revolutionist, set about the consummation of his theories, every musician understood perfectly what his theories were, though many angrily doubted and denied that music could respond to the call he made upon it. In all his labor there were system, consecutiveness, and art; otherwise, he would have failed. Has Mr. Whitman enunciated an intelligible theory? He speaks vaguely about poetry being written under the influence of our democratic institutions. Well and good. Now, Dame Columbia may insist on free thought and free speech; but she is not maudlin, nor incoherent. Her head is clear, her mien self-reliant, her actions brisk and animated, her perception acute, and her imagination warm and glowing. There is nothing confused or aimless about her. A literature in accord with democracy would partake of these attributes. If Mr. Whitman desires an original American literature, his plea is praiseworthy. The material for a literature that will do honor to the English tongue is to be found in this country, and the mine is now being worked. I feel no hesitation in saying that the spirit of Mr. Whitman's poetry is the contrary of the democratic spirit, because it is deficient in clearness, in consistency, in art, and in common sense. At first blush there may seem to be a kinship of liberty; but the liberty of democracy is the highest evolutionary step in the struggle for the rights of man, while the liberty of Walt Whitman's poetry is license of thought and anarchy of expression. Most people take pride in conquering the thoughts which he takes a riotous glee in giving vent to.</p><p>The thinking man of to-day finds himself beset with in-crowding problems, and the mission of literature should be to relieve him from the depressing sense of the infinities. In no way can cheer be flashed into his darkened, perplexed mind except by preserving as a holy thing his faith in the unseen and spiritual, by keeping a line perpetually drawn between the just and the unjust, by placing what is good aloft in conspicuous splendor and sending evil to the gloomy shadows below; by preserving the ideals of purity and 'sweetness and light'; by fixing virtue on a lasting pedestal and dethroning vice from its seat in the hearts of men. The man who obscures these valuable results of moral teaching, who leaves a doubt in the mind as to whether good is preferable to evil, who exalts the flesh\u2014that incubus upon the loftiest dreams of purity\u2014and calls the soul the body, can hardly be considered as bringing with him a message that we are bound either to receive or to respect.</p><p>WALKER KENNEDY.</p>", "date": "June 1884", "year": 1884, "creator": "Walker Kennedy", "publication": "North American Review", "citation": "Kennedy, Walker. \"Walt Whitman.\" June 1884.

He himself confessed to a friend that he had 'no talent for industry.' During his early years we find too many changes of occupation and scene, printing, editing, writing, publishing, teaching, joinering, house-building; one time in New York, another in New Orleans, then back again or up and down the country. This erratic temperament displays itself in the scrappy character of much of his literary work. Yet he was the reverse of an idle man. He always earned his bread. If his worldly gains were small, there was compensation in the modesty of his wants. He said he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread and water.</p><p>Whitman's admirers have certainly no right to complain that his energies were not centered on trade or other fortune making. All those years of miscellaneous occupation and variety of scene were his apprenticeship. The 'many a good day or half-day' on Long Island, of which he tells, riding, boating, walking, 'absorbing fields, shores, marine incidents, characters, the bay-men, farmers, pilots, fishermen,' by-and-by took form in poetry. So also did the city scenes in which he mingled; his jaunts on New York omnibuses, and intercourse with the drivers\u2014'Broadway Jack,' 'Old Elephant,' 'Yellow Joe,' and the rest\u2014and with the toilers in the workshops and with the loungers in the streets. 'I suppose the critics will laugh heartily,' he writes, 'but the influence of those Broadway omnibus jaunts, and drivers, and declamations, and escapades, undoubtedly entered into the gestation of Leaves of Grass.' He visited hospitals, alms-houses and prisons, attended political gatherings, frequented taverns, and was the friend of publicans and sinners. He was a good observer and a good hearer, and his curiosity was unbounded. He would take nothing from another's report, but must see and hear and feel for himself. The gods had provided a banquet of life, and he would taste of every dish, whether it were sweet or bitter. To a weaker spirit than his, it might have been a perilous thing to do. That which we call experience is the soul's vision of itself in the mirror of the world; the spectacle may well frighten those who dare not to discover, even to themselves, what they really are; but the strong, seeing their defects, aspire to perfection. To the well-constituted mind variety brings health, rough contact invigorates, the experiences of the world, smooth and rugged, yield pure benefit.</p><p>What precisely Whitman did during this period I do not know and am not interested to discover. The mere knowledge of a man's deeds may easily mislead the judgment. Did he do this or that? What does it signify? The vital questions are, What were his opportunities? what use did he make of them? how would he have behaved under other conditions? Whitman was never on trial with felons, yet he confessed himself as much a felon as those who were:</p><p>'You felons on trial in courts,<br>You convicts in prison cells; you sentenced assassins chain'd and <br>handcuff'd with iron,<br>Who am I, too, that I am not on trial or in prison?<br>Me, ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain'd with<br> iron or my ankles with iron?<br>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217<br>O, admirers! praise me not\u2014compliment me not\u2014you make me <br>wince,<br>I see what you do not, I know what you do not.'</p><p>This bit of experience will find a responsive echo in many minds. Have we not all felt, some time in our lives, when we have been made confidants of some secret wrong or have witnessed the exposure of evil-doers, how equally guilty in all but the mere deed we also were? Nay, have we not felt we were in some sort worse than those others, because, being guilty, we were praised as innocent, or at least escaped due chastisement, merely because we did not make our guilt manifest in an act? Worthy John Bradford, when he saw a criminal carried to execution, used to say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes John Bradford.' If it were not for the grace of God, or, if you prefer, the fortunate chance or the want of opportunity to do ill, not a few on-lookers, not a few reputed saints, would be standing side by side with the felons on trial in the courts.</p><p>Nevertheless, this acknowledgement of kinship in sin or in the possibility of sin, is only a half statement of the truth that sin itself is lesser or stunted virtue, just as darkness is only light too thinly spread for human eyes to perceive. Men never turn themselves from the good, though they do not keep it continually in view; and, though they stumble and hesitate, their look and movement are always onward.</p><p>How Whitman emerged from his experiences must be shown in his life, yet it is worth while to note that he is not blamed for these experiences, but for making a record of them. While others have been superficial and circumspect in what they wrote, he has striven to be thorough, and great has been the disgust that what every one secretly knew and was thinking of or timidly hinting, he should boldly declare. Such unaccustomed thoroughness caused an outcry; but he felt that, if he was to depict man at all, his presentment must be entire.</p><p>Yet Whitman's honest bluntness is not without a touch of bravado, I think. It comes primarily from an intellectual conviction that in nature there are no indecencies, and to this conviction he resolves to give the fullest utterance. For his part, nothing being improper, nothing shall be suppressed. Mr. Lowell's remark that Fielding 'had the courage to be absolutely sincere if he had not always the tact to see where sincerity was out of place' may be not inaptly applied to Whitman. There is much, too, in the way a thing is treated, and Whitman's touch, it must be admitted, is not delicate. His speech is open but not quite spontaneous; not as free and natural, for example, as the language of Fielding in some of his books. He is aware that he is doing rather a daring thing. He must wonder a little what the effect will be upon his readers. In other words, his expression of himself is conscious. Perhaps in our age this is unavoidable. Thackeray lamented that the condition of the time prevented him from using absolutely sincere expressions, and possibly he would have been a happier man and a healthier writer if he had had the liberty he craved. It is related that when Bayard Taylor was a child, his mother, who had been a Quakeress, tried so constantly to impress upon him the wickedness of profane swearing, that his imagination became centered on oaths, and he was filled with an uncontrollable desire to swear. So he went into the fields, beyond hearing, and there gave vent to all the oaths he had ever heard or could invent, in as loud a voice as possible. After this he felt happy. The human race may have been in a like predicament until Whitman relieved it, for a time, by his bold utterance. At any rate, I think thereby he relieved himself and, having written the section of his book called 'Children of Adam,' was free for the efficient performance of work more generally acceptable and useful. And, after all, the chief point is whether the statement he makes is true or false.</p><p>Out of his experience Whitman constructed his book. Leaves of Grass was begun on the shores of Long Island in 1853, the author being then thirty-four years old. He set it in type himself in the printing-office of a friend. It contained twelve pieces in verse and a preface in prose. In 1855 it appeared. A thousand copies were printed. Some were sent to newspapers and to public men, and afforded a certain amount of amusement to the recipients. The style was curious, and some of the ideas seemed odd and uncouth. Emerson, however, chancing upon a copy, discerned its value. He alone, of all the persons who saw the work, perceived that there was something worthy in it. He thought he discerned the signs of genius in its early dawn, and wrote straightway to the author to tell him that in his book he had found 'incomparable things said incomparably well. . . . The solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Few if any copies of the book were sold.</p><p>The second edition was issued in 1856, a much thicker volume than the first. It contained some of the pieces which are now gathered together in the section called 'Children of Adam,' and these changed the scornful laughter of the critics into angry denunciation. The sharp controversy to which they gave rise has not yet wholly subsided. The prose preface had disappeared or rather had taken poetical form. Since then several editions have appeared with varying but for the most part small fortune. One publisher failed; others grew timid and withdrew. The current edition issued in 1881, is the only one which, commercially, has proved a marked success.</p><p>When the fourth edition was published, Whitman had gathered an important, new experience to be woven into poems. The Civil War had taken place. His brother having been wounded in an early engagement, he went to the front to nurse him. Once there, his sympathy with suffering was too strong to permit him to return. It is on record that he was careful to have his name on the roll of volunteers eligible for service, but he was not drafted. In the hospitals he found work as useful and as arduous, and needing as much courage as service in the army itself. But it was congenial, for his heart was more in saving than in slaying. It is said that during the war he personally tended or in some way aided not fewer than 100,000 wounded soldiers. Some of these services seem slight enough. A passing kindly word or touch or smile; but the suffering and lonely men appreciated such tokens of love. To not a few the last earthly vision was of that countenance glowing with tenderness. Whitman's aim was not to supplant but to suplement the doctors and nurses by giving aid which they had not the time, even if they had the understanding to give. He knew that more was needed than medical and surgical skill; that to these soldiers on beds of sickness, often of death, far from their friends, the power of a touch of home-tenderness would be magical. Hence, in many instances he gave true and substantial aid by pressing a hand or by a kiss or a smile or a word of cheer as he passed the bed; or he would write a letter to wife or mother, or give a little money or tobacco or an orange, or receive a message from the dying. Humane persons in different parts of the country sent him money and stores to carry on his work, and not a little came from his own pocket. A small volume called Drum Taps, issued in 1865, is Whitman's record of his war-experiences. To it he appended a few pathetic pieces referring to the death of President Lincoln. All are now incorporated with Leaves of Grass.</p><p>In connection with these experiences, nothing is more significant than the expansion of Whitman's sentiment towards death. Already in his 'Song of Myself' he had said, 'As to you, Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try and alarm me . . . And, as to you, Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, (no doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before).' But in the war and the tragedy of President Lincoln's death at its close, that which before had been perceived by the intellect has fused itself, by experience, into the life. He has faced death, mingled with it, borne it daily through four terrible years, and now he can sing his glowing chants of 'heavenly death.' The poet of life will, henceforward, be the poet of death also. Here, as I think, is Whitman's real advance beyond his predecessors. Others have treated death as a 'dread monster,' an enemy, or, like Emerson, have steadily ignored it. Even Goethe said, 'Death is something so strange that, notwithstanding all experience, one thinks it impossible for it to seize a beloved object; and it always presents itself as something incredible and unexpected.['] No doubt Spinoza was right when he said, 'A free man thinks of nothing less than of death, and his wisdom is not a meditation upon death but upon life.' But Whitman has demonstrated the power of a free man to find the blessedness of death as well as the blessedness of life. He alone hails it lovingly as a friend:\u2014</p><p>'Come lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later delicate death.</p><p>'Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.</p><p>'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come <br>unfalteringly.'</p><p>Towards the close of the war Whitman contracted blood-poisoning in the hospital, and thus, at 45 years of age, was stricken with the first serious illness of his life. He never quite recovered, although after a short interval he resumed his ministrations. When the war was over he obtained, successively, two offices under the American Government. From the first he was dismissed, because he was the author of Leaves of Grass, and Mr. Harlan, the head of his department, did not approve of the book; and to the second, under the Attorney-General, he was appointed because of his dismissal from the first. Here he remained until 1873, when, at length, the hardship and sickness of the war time, followed as it was by too frugal living that he might have more to dispose in charity, laid him low with paralysis.</p><p>Whitman bore sickness and destitution in the same calm spirit with which he had met the many previous changes of his life. No longer able to be an active helper in the world, his time henceforth, for several years, was spent away from cities; and in the abounding life of the country he formed new ties of fellowship with animals, trees and flowers. Some of the best passages in his note books and poems relate to this period, and very touching are these records of the poet's simple life when, broken in health by labours of love among his fellow-men, he sought rest and, as far as might be, to renew the vigour he had lost. Nature is always tender to a noble spirit, and she treated him well.</p><p>The enjoyment Whitman derives from nature apart from man, is sensuous and something more. Nature is health-giving and restful, and appeals to his sense of beauty, but it also touches his spiritual sense. In the birds, insects, animals and trees he feels the presence of the same soul which he himself shares. 'I have a positive conviction,' he says, 'that some of these birds fly and flirt about here for my especial benefit.' For the sea he had a peculiar regard. Mr. Conway, who bathed with him, noticed that he fairly hugged the water. Passages throughout his works indicate this affection. He speaks of 'the soothing rustle of the waves.' He relates that when a boy he had a wish to write a poem about the sea-shore, 'that suggestive dividing line, the solid marrying the liquid.' But afterwards he felt that instead of making this his theme, it should be, rather, 'an invisible influence' pervading his work. It is interesting to observe that the restful unrest and the vastness of the sea do typify his poems.</p><p>If Whitman does not deliberately claim to be the Poet of the Modern, assuredly he would not repudiate the title. He really accepts the mission when he says, 'the modern man I sing;' and when, throughout his prose as well as his poetry, he proclaims how ample are the materials to his hand in the affairs of to-day, for the making of poems. Dr. Bucke, his intimate friend and truly able biographer, who plays Boswell to Whitman's Johnson, reports: 'He said to me one day that he considered the most distinguishing feature of his own poetry to be 'its modernness\u2014the taking up in their own spirit of all that specially differentiates our era from others, particularly our democratic tendencies.'' Hitherto feudalism or the system of the past had been the theme of poets. They sang of chivalry, of wars, warriors, and kings, nor does he discard these:</p><p>'In the name of the States, shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.'</p><p>Nevertheless, Whitman's own theme shall be America, the type of the modern, built on the antique; and by America he means, not the actuality of to-day so much as the ideal world of energy, freedom, and advancement. Yet he believed that 'this teeming nation of nations' was 'essentially the greatest poem.' Accordingly, he writes of America. Others have glorified man in his hour of repose; he will do this and more. The workman at the bench and the farmer in the field seem to him not less beautiful than the struggle and adventure chronicled by Shakespeare. The life of 'the average man, in average circumstances,' might, he believed, be 'still grand\u2014heroic.' 'We owe to genius,' said Emerson, 'always the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common and showing us that divinities are sitting disguised in the seeming gang of gypsies and pedlars.' Man as a worker and the implements of his work are proper subjects for song:</p><p>'Ah little recks the labourer,<br>How near his work is holding him to God,<br>The loving Labourer through space and time.'</p><p>Goethe affirmed that 'at bottom no real object is unpoetical if the poet knows how to use it properly.' Thoreau found the spirit of music in the telegraph-pole, but it remained for Whitman to write a poem\u2014strikingly picturesque\u2014'To a Locomotive in Winter,' a 'Song of the Broad Axe,' and a 'Song of Occupations,' in which he says</p><p>'In the labour of engines and trades and the labour of the fields I <br>find the developments,<br>And find the eternal meanings.'</p><p>The chief difference between the poets of Chivalry and this poet of the Modern is a difference in their choice of illustrations. The former extolled honour and courage as displayed in battle; Whitman also extols honour and courage, but finds it here to-day in the street and the workshop, and he considers these spheres for the exercise of virtue the most appropriate for celebration in the poetry of the living present. There were poets of the Modern before Whitman, though none of them sang on principle, so to speak, as he does. In truth, he fills an undue proportion of his books, not in singing the modern, but in singing about singing it. I think it was Mr. Ernest Rhys who first drew a comparison between Whitman and Burns. Burns was truly a 'poet of the Modern' when in 'The Cottar's Saturday Night,' lifting the curtain from the common-place, he actually did, without any theories or announcements, sing 'the modern man.' Whitman, however, for the first time, treats man working, as a subject for poems.</p><p>I do not advise any one to read Leaves of Grass except as a whole. It would not be understood. Passages are easy to find which, when detached, seem foolish or offensive but which in their proper place contribute to the harmony of the structure. When one of the editions was in preparation a friend of Whitman urged him to omit certain passages, saying, 'What in the world do you want to put in that stuff for that nobody can read?' Whitman replied, 'Well, John, if you need to ask that question it is evident, at any rate, that the book was not written for you;' a fitting answer to other objectors.</p><p>Nevertheless, John's difficulty was not unnatural. It does take time to find the key to this poetry, and the first impression is likely to be the least favourable. Startling departures from literary conventionalities must be overcome. The initial trouble is the peculiar form\u2014a kind of rhythmic prose. It seems calculated to obscure rather to elucidate the author's meaning. If Whitman's sense of the ludicrous had been more keen, there are passages in his book which he would by no means have admitted. He is an exceedingly literal man, a fact which makes his work precise and careful; but had he been something of a humourist his language and his grouping of facts would not have been quite what they are.</p><p>Tested by scholastic rules, I suppose Leaves of Grass would not be called poetry at all. It does not obey the laws of prosody, yet musicians have affirmed that it does obey the laws of music. When, however, the key of the meaning is found, the propriety of the form is felt; it almost seems as though no other form would have served. A comparison between Leaves of Grass and the finest Whitman's prose, shows that the former stands upon a level altogether higher than the latter. Here, as in all works of true power, the thought has created its own befitting form.</p><p>Leaves of Grass expresses a triune doctrine of Unity, Beauty, and Progression. It represents human nature as everywhere the same, and not human nature only, but animals, plants and what are called inanimate things also; it affirms that everything in its own place is beautiful, and that there is a tendency, through all, toward an unseen but certain goal. The 'comradeship' insisted upon so untiringly by Whitman is the corollary. That which we feel to be akin to us stimulates sympathy; and if all things belong thus one to another, universal brotherhood must result. Furthermore, if all things, however lowly, have their appropriate place and task, contempt is out of the question. To us, henceforth, there can be nothing 'common or unclean.'</p><p>The poems of Whitman's earlier period are full of city life, and breathe the spirit of fellowship which characterized those ferry boat and omnibus jaunts and the familiar intercourse of the streets. They are, in essence, poems of comradeship and sexual love. In majestic chants he presents a vivid picture of this wonderful life of the world, its contrasts and antagonisms on the surface and the oneness underneath. He notes the sights and sounds of a great city\u2014the carter, the factory girl, the president, the boatman, the conductor, all attending to their various avocations. While here the slave is sold in the market, there the infant is baptized in the Church; in one place a drunken prostitute curses a jeering crowd, while, not far off, a convert is 'making his first profession.' The singer is singing in the organ loft, and the children 'ride home from their Thanksgiving dinner,' even while, elsewhere, 'the lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirmed case.' Thus, pain and pleasure mingling, life proceeds, while a man of large heart watches it with the eyes of a poet, and perceives the kinship of one with another and of himself with all. 'The known universe,' he says, 'has one complete lover, and that is the greatest poet.' This is the Comradeship of which he speaks so often, and his ministrations to the outcast men and women in the city streets and the prisons, and to the wounded soldiers in the war-hospitals, testify to the sincerity of his belief in comradeship. 'We believe only as deep as we live.' He not only wrote but lived 'the evangel poem of comrades and of love.' His sympathy extends to those whom society excludes. They too are members of the human family, having claims upon him,\u2014claims all the greater because of the greater need. Let others cast stones if they choose; he will treat them, not with the partiality and prejudice of men, but in the spirit of nature:</p><p>'Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you,<br>Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to rustle <br>for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.'</p><p>He sees through the husk of sin to the soul beyond, and is filled with pity. The surpassing tenderness, without a trace of morbidness, of the piece called 'The City Dead House,' lingers long in the memory, and the lesson of charity it instills will not be readily effaced.</p><p>Whitman, I have said, preaches Beauty also; the universal fitness of things. He does not choose the good and discard the evil, but, shutting his eyes to nothing, he sees that the law of the universe is benefit. Failure! Evil! these are the reverse side, and as appropriate in their place as success and virtue in theirs:</p><p>'How perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it!<br>What is called good is perfect, and what is called evil is just as perfect.'</p><p>'The chief end I purpose to myself in all my labours,' wrote Dean Swift, 'is to vex the world rather than divert it.' In the person of the 'Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,' we have still amongst us a very different type of man, whose purpose is to divert the world rather than to vex it. Yet Swift to vex the world, and Holmes to entertain it, alike expose the weakness and folly of mankind. They discover to their fellow-men the unsavoury realities of human life, Swift the low aims and hypocrisy of men, and Holmes their defects of speech and manners. The method of Whitman is different. He does not show humanity to be either hideous or ridiculous. Swift and, in more superficial fashion, Holmes, regard man as vile, and expose the faults they see, with a desire, perhaps, for their removal. The bulk of persons seem to regard man as vile, and strive not so much to remove the vileness as to hide it. Whitman looks deeper and sees only the beautiful.</p><p>The other feature of Whitman's doctrine is Progression, the eternal onward march of the soul. Life is a development, onward, 'for ever and for ever, longer than soil is brown and solid, longer than water ebbs and flows':</p><p>'This day, before dawn, I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded <br>heaven,<br>And I said to my spirit, When we become the enfolders of these orbs, <br>and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them, shall we be <br>fill'd and satisfied then?<br>And my spirit said 'No.''</p><p>To show to man the dignity of his calling, that his path through life is fair and that he has a noble destiny, is the best service which can be rendered to virtue. When these truths are understood, grossness in thought or deed becomes impossible. Such a doctrine as Whitman's leaves no room for doubt or misgiving. It summons men to put forth their best powers. It demands nothing less than perfect manhood and womanhood. To the key-note which it strikes, the chord in the human heart that will respond is nobility,\u2014the love of divine things and the high aim.</p><p>In any final estimate of Leaves of Grass, it is necessary to take into account the fact that, in spite of peculiarities of style and thought, and of relentless opposition encountered from the first, the book has steadily made its way. Many, whose opinion cannot be despised, have thought well of it. Emerson, as we have seen, admired it at the beginning. A quarter of a century later, George Eliot, being induced, with some difficulty, to read it, found that it contained what was 'good for her soul.' Mr. Swinburne, in the days when he was himself a poet, wrote friendly greetings to Whitman, but he has recanted, and scolds him now like Dr. Peter Bayne. Among Whitman's personal friends were Bryant and Longfellow. Thoreau, after visiting him with Alcott in 1856, came to the conclusion that 'We ought to rejoice greatly in him . . . he is a great fellow.' No success or reputation ever gets itself established unless it is rooted in character. Whitman, like his book, is strong. It is himself that speaks, not the echo of another.

Cavazza. Portland, Me.: Thomas B. Mosher. $1.50); and the last, gray felt-bound 'Leaves of Grass' (Philadelphia: D. McKay. $2.00),\u2014that issue which Whitman, almost in his last breath, called his 'special and entire self-chosen poetic utterance,' wishing it 'to absolutely supersede all previous editions.' These works of two American and one English poet represent a great deal that is most salient in modern poetic expression, and, constituting at once a small and a large library,\u2014a wide poetic range in but three volumes,\u2014especially deserve purchase by one of liberal taste and culture. The conflicting difference between man and Nature, finding expression in poetry and making way toward a new outlook, is given characteristically by Lowell, for example, in his little poem 'The Nightingale in the Study.' Cat-bird and thrush scoff at his 'many-volumed gains,' the 'withered leaves' he turns in his study in order to win at best, for all his pains, 'A nature mummy-wrapt in learning;' but the singers of all weathers, the nightingales in his study, the poet maintains, give their 'best sweetness to all song, To Nature's self her better glory.' The rich involutions of Meredith's story of a present-day Othello contains another word on man's command of Nature. Nature plays 'for Seasons, not Eternities,' as must 'All those whose stake is nothing more than dust;' and in his closing sonnet he finds the secret of the woe of the 'ever-diverse pair' he depicts, in that 'they fed not on the advancing hours,' but sought the 'dusty answer' the soul gets 'When hot for certainties in this our life.' The poet of human selfhood, ordinarily supposed to be less weighted with the lore of libraries than Lowell, less subtly introspective than Meredith, supposed to be, indeed, only an untutored child of Nature herself, seems yet to have written in his 'Leaves of Grass'\u2014for example, in his praise of mind-images he calls 'Eid\u00f3lons'\u2014of all the songs of thought's supremacy the most unequivocal:\u2014</p><p>'Lo, I or you<br>Or woman, man, or State, known or unknown,<br>We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty, build,<br>But really build eid\u00f3lons.<br>. . . . . . .<br>Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,<br>Far-born, far dying, living long, to leave<br>Eid\u00f3lons everlasting.<br>Not this the world,<br>Nor these the universes, they the universe,<br>Purport and end, ever the permanent life of life.'</p>", "date": "1892", "year": 1892, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "Poet Lore", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass (1891\u201392)].\" 1892.

The history of that composition, so far, is curious. It has already had three births, or successive issues.</p><p>The first issue of the poems consisted of a thin quarto volume of 96 pages, in Brooklyn, in 1855. It comprised eleven pieces, and was received with derision by the literary law givers. The only exception was a note from Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p><p>The work sold, however, and in 1857 a second issue, a very neat 16mo. volume of 384 pages, was published in New York, containing thirty-two poems.</p><p>The book now in the market, the third issue, containing, large and small, one hundred and fifty-four poems, superbly printed, (it is indeed universally pronounced, here and in England, a perfect specimen of choice typography,) came forth in Boston, the current year, 1860.</p><p>Such is the book to which this curious collection of 'criticisms' refers. The poem itself, (for 'LEAVES OF GRASS,' all have a compact unity,) may be described, in short terms, as the Song of the sovereignty of One\u2019s self\u2014and the Song of entire faith in all that Nature is, universal, and particular\u2014and in all that belongs to a man, body and soul. The egotistical outset, 'I celebrate myself,' and which runs in spirit through so much of the volume, speaks for him or her reading it precisely the same as for the author, and is invariably to be so applied. Thus the book is a gospel of self-assertion and self-reliance for every American reader\u2014which is the same as saying it is the gospel of Democracy.</p><p>A man 'in perfect health' here comes forward, devoting his life to the experiment of singing the New World in a New Song\u2014not only new in spirit, but new in letter, in form. To him America means not at all a second edition, an adaptation of Europe\u2014not content with a new theory and practice of politics only\u2014but above its politics, and more important than they, inaugurating new and infinitely more generous and comprehensive theories of Sociology, Literature, Religion and Comradeship.</p><p>We therefore do not wonder at the general howl with which these poem the 'Imprints' refer to, has been received both in America and in Europe. The truth about the poem and its author is, that they both of them confound and contradict several of the most cherished of the old and hitherto accepted canons upon the right manner and matter of men and books\u2014and cannot be judged thereby;\u2014but aim to establish new canons, and can only be judged by them. Just the same as America itself does and can only be judged.</p><p>Neither can the song of 'Leaves of Grass' ever be judged by the intellect\u2014nor suffice to be read merely once or so, for amusement. This strange song, (often offensive to the intellect), is to be felt, absorbed by the soul. It is to be dwelt upon\u2014returned to, again and again. It wants a broad space to turn in, like a big ship. Many readers, perhaps the majority, will be perplexed and baffled by it at first; but in frequent cases those who liked the book least at first will take it closest to their hearts upon a second or third perusal.</p><p>Permanency is written all over the poem, so far. Also, a peculiar native idiomatic flavor is in it, to many disagreeable. There is no denying, indeed, that an essential quality it takes from its author, is, (as has been charged,) the quality of the celebrated New York 'rough,' full of muscular and excessively virile energy, full of animal blood, masterful, striding to the front rank, allowing none to walk before him, full of rudeness and recklessness, talking and acting his own way, utterly regardless of other people\u2019s ways.</p><p>The cry of indecency against 'Leaves of Grass' amounts, when plainly stated, about to this: Other writers assume that the sexual relations are shameful in themselves, and not to be put in poems. But our new bard, walking right straight through all that, assumes that those very relations are the most beautiful and pure and divine of any\u2014and in that way he 'celebrates' them. No wonder he confounds the orthodox. Yet his indecency is the ever-recurring indecency of the inspired Biblical writers\u2014and is that of innocent youth, and of the natural and untainted man in all ages.</p><p>In other words, the only explanation the reader needs to bear in mind to clear up the whole matter is this: The subjects ('amativeness,' &c.,) about which such a storm has been raised, are treated by Walt Whitman with unprecedented boldness and candor, but always in the very highest religious and esthetic spirit. Filthy to others, to him they are not filthy, but 'illustrious.' While his 'critics,' (carefully minding never to state the foregoing fact, thought it is stamped all over the book,) consider those subjects in 'Leaves of Grass,' from the point of view of persons standing on the lowest animal and infidelistic platform. Which, then, is really the 'beast?'</p><p>Those who really know Walt Whitman will be amused beyond measure at the personal statements put forth about him in some of these criticisms. We believe it was Dr. Dictionary Johnson who said that persons of any celebrity may calculate how much truth there is in histories and written lives by weighing the amount of that article in the stuff that is printed about themselves.</p><p>The notices, &c., in this supplement, from pages 3 to 64, refer in their allusions to the typography, &c., to the first and second issues of 'Leaves of Grass.' The paper, print, and binding of the present edition of the Thayer & Eldridge have, as we before said, received, as they deserve, unconditional applause.</p>", "date": "October 10 1860", "year": 1860, "creator": "Walt Whitman", "publication": "Brooklyn City News", "citation": "Whitman, Walt [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Leaves of Grass Imprints].\" 10 October 1860.

Both Whitman and Ward are representative men. In them, for the first time, the full strength of our American life receives expression\u2014receives assertion. We have had in our Poetry and Art idealizations of loftier aspiration\u2014imaginations of finer conceit\u2014but they were not grounded in our soil; even though American in their reference, they were foreign to our New World; they belonged rather to some modern school of thought, than to our modern and American life\u2014they were not the outgrowth of that new movement in civilization which America inaugurates.</p><p>In all human organizations, whether those of personal or of national life, there is the moment of consciousness as self, as individual\u2014a moment full of original force.</p><p>This 'I Am' of youth, may include more or less of meaning according to the status of organic development. The youthful self-assertion of one age implies more than the assertion of an anterior epoch. Life is an ever on- flowing tide; each successive wave strands the human consciousness upon a higher look-out. The earlier ages expressed their consciousness of life, through the imagination, by mythical rites and symbols. America now first in the world's history experiences this life as superior to all forms\u2014as ever forming -itself never bounded by form\u2014as the common life, common as the 'leaves of grass'\u2014as the great fraternizing element\u2014as the all-sufficient\u2014the vast, indomitable, sole Fact. In literature\u2014Whitman, in art\u2014Ward, are they who come forward to express this New-World self-assertion of ours, in all its boundless and fierce strength. Both fling aside the buskin and come down to the common ground; they state that which is, and thereby give the fact\u2014the thing -its truest and highest idealization; for the fact\u2014the thing\u2014thus simply and absolutely given, is at once spiritual and material\u2014is ideal.</p><p>As an artist\u2014that is, as one who gives a complete and harmonious externalization to his feeling\u2014Mr. Whitman is much inferior to Mr. Ward. Still the poet may be said to be more truly artistic than if he were more ostensibly so. He sets out to assert himself\u2014the conscious American life as superior to restrictions of time and place, as all-containing, all-sanctifying. His inartistic looseness of style and expression is quite consistent with this mood. The poet, in consequence, presents himself to the mind as a more congruous and artistic whole than if he had modeled his verse in accordance with all the unities of Art.</p><p>In Whitman's last collection, we observe a much greater regard for beauty of form than the Leaves of Grass displayed. The latter work was full of the ungoverned vigor of life-consciousness; the present exhibits a tendency to define this vigor by lines of beauty. We accordingly discover greater regularity of rhythm, and more unity of conception in the grouping of details.</p><p>But our present object is to introduce an extract from Drum Taps, which may, we hope, incite the reader to a serious study of the works of its author\u2014the most remarkable outgrowths of our New-World life. As the earlier poems were not a bouquet of garden flowers, but leaves of grass plucked by the handful from the bosom of nature, with here and there a wild blossom, fresh, juicy, wet with the dews of morning, so the recent ones\u2014referring to that upheaving of the Great Life in human action which has marked our times\u2014are not the elaborate martial strains of the parade-ground, but the vigorous 'drums taps' of the column in march.</p><p>PIONEERS!<br>O PIONEERS!<br>1.<br>Come, my tan-faced children,<br>Follow well in order, get your weapons ready;<br>Have you your pistols? have you your sharp-edged <br>axes?<br>Pioneers!

Doubts to be solved by the wise futurity which shall pay off our national debt. Poet or not, however, there was that in Walt Whitman's first book which compels attention to his second. There are obvious differences between the two: this is much smaller than that; and whereas you had at times to hold your nose (as a great sage observed) in reading 'Leaves of Grass,' there is not an indecent thing in 'Drum-Taps.' The artistic method of the poet remains, however, the same, and we must think it mistaken. The trouble about it is that it does not give you sensation in a portable shape; the thought is as intangible as aroma; it is no more put up than the atmosphere.</p><p>We are to suppose that Mr. Whitman first adopted his method as something that came to him of its own motion. This is the best possible reason, and only possible excuse, for it. In its way, it is quite as artificial as that of any other poet, while it is unspeakably inartistic. On this account it is a failure. The method of talking to one's self in rhythmic and ecstatic prose is one that surprises at first, but, in the end, the talker can only have the devil for a listener, as happens in other cases when people address their own individualities; not, however, the devil of the proverb, but the devil of reasonless, hopeless, all-defying egotism. An ingenious French critic said very acutely of Mr. Whitman that he made you partner of the poetical enterprise, which is perfectly true; but no one wants to share the enterprise. We want its effect, its success; we do not want to plant corn, to hoe it, to drive the crows away, to gather it, husk it, grind it, sift it, bake it, and butter it, before eating it, and then take the risk of its being at last moldy in our mouths. And this is what you have to do in reading Mr. Whitman's rhythm.</p><p>At first, a favorable impression is made by the lawlessness of this poet, and one asks himself if this is not the form which the unconscious poetry of American life would take, if it could find a general utterance. But there is really no evidence that such is the case. It is certain that among the rudest peoples the lurking sublimity of nature has always sought expression in artistic form, and there is no good reason to believe that the sentiment of a people with our high average culture would seek expression more rude and formless than that of the savagest tribes. Is it not more probable that, if the passional principle of American life could find utterance, it would choose the highest, least dubious, most articulate speech? Could the finest, most shapely expression be too good for it?</p><p>If we are to judge the worth of Mr. Whitman's poetic theory (or impulse, or possession) by its popular success, we must confess that he is wrong. It is already many years since he first appeared with his claim of poet, and in that time he has employed criticism as much as any literary man in our country, and he has enjoyed the fructifying extremes of blame and praise. Yet he is, perhaps, less known to the popular mind, to which he has attempted to give an utterance, than the newest growth of the magazines and the newspaper notices. The people fairly rejected his former revelation, letter and spirit, and those who enjoyed it were readers with a cultivated taste for the quaint and the outlandish. The time to denounce or to ridicule Mr. Whitman for his first book is past. The case of 'Leaves of Grass' was long ago taken out [of] the hands of counsel and referred to the great jury. They have pronounced no audible verdict; but what does their silence mean? There were reasons in the preponderant beastliness of that book why a decent public should reject it; but now the poet has cleansed the old channels of their filth, and pours through them a stream of blameless purity, and the public has again to decide, and this time more directly, on the question of his poethood. As we said, his method remains the same, and he himself declares that, so far as concerns it, he has not changed nor grown in any way since we saw him last.</p><p>'Beginning my studies, the first step pleased me so much,<br>The mere fact, consciousness\u2014these forms\u2014the power of <br>motion.<br>The least insect or animal\u2014the senses\u2014eye-sight;<br>The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,<br>I have never gone, and never wish'd to go, any further,<br>But stop and loiter all my life to sing it in ecstatic <br>songs.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman has summed up his own poetical theory so well in these lines, that no criticism could possibly have done it better. It makes us doubt, indeed, if all we have said in consideration of him has not been said idly, and certainly releases us from further explanation of his method.</p><p>In 'Drum-Taps,' there is far more equality than in 'Leaves of Grass,' and though the poet is not the least changed in purpose, he is certainly changed in fact. The pieces of the new book are nearly all very brief, but generally his expression is freer and fuller than ever before. The reader understands, doubtless, from the title, that nearly all these pieces relate to the war; and they celebrate many of the experiences of the author in the noble part he took in the war. One imagines that burly tenderness of the man who went to supply the</p><p>'\u2014\u2014lack of woman's nursing'</p><p>that there was in the hospitals of the field, and woman's tears creep unconsciously to the eyes as the pity of his heart communicates itself to his reader's. No doubt the pathos of many of the poems gains something from the quaintness of the poet's speech. One is touched in reading them by the same inarticulate feeling as that which dwells in music; and is sensible that the poet conveys to the heart certain emotions which the brain cannot analyze, and only remotely perceives. This is especially true of his inspirations from nature; memories and yearnings come to you folded, mute, and motionless in his verse, as they come in the breath of a familiar perfume. They give a strange, shadowy sort of pleasure, but they do not satisfy, and you rise from the perusal of this man's book as you issue from the presence of one whose personal magnetism is very subtle and strong, but who has not added to this tacit attraction the charm of spoken ideas. We must not mistake this fascination for a higher quality. In the tender eyes of an ox lurks a melancholy, soft and pleasing to the glance as the pensive sweetness of a woman's eyes; but in the orb of the brute there is no hope of expression, and in the woman's look there is the endless delight of history, the heavenly; possibility of utterance.</p><p>Art cannot greatly employ itself with things in embryo. The instinct of the beast may interest science; but poetry, which is nobler than science, must concern itself with natural instincts only as they can be developed into the sentiments and ideas of the soul of man. The mind will absorb from nature all that is speechless in her influences: and it will demand from kindred mind those higher things which can be spoken. Let us say our say here against the nonsense, long current, that there is, or can be, poetry between the lines, as is often sillily asserted. Expression will always suggest; but mere suggestion in art is unworthy of existence, vexes the heart, and shall not live. Every man has tender, and beautiful, and lofty emotions; but the poet was sent into this world to give these a tangible utterance, and if he do not this, but only give us back dumb emotion for dumb emotion, he is a cumberer of the earth. There is a yearning, almost to agony at times, in the human heart, to throw off the burden of inarticulate feeling, and if the poet will not help it in this effort, if, on the contrary, he shall seek to weigh it and sink it down under heavier burdens, he has not any reason to be.</p><p>So long, then, as Mr. Whitman chooses to stop at mere consciousness, he cannot be called a true poet. We all have consciousness; but we ask of art an utterance. We do not so much care in what way we get this expression; we will take it in ecstatic prose, though we think it is better subjected to the laws of prosody, since every good thing is subject to some law; but the expression we must have. Often, in spite of himself, Mr. Whitman grants it in this volume, and there is some hope that he will hereafter grant it more and more. There are such rich possibilities in the man that it is lamentable to contemplate his error of theory. He has truly and thoroughly absorbed the idea of our American life, and we say to him as he says to himself, 'You've got enough in you, Walt; why don't you get it out?' A man's greatness is good for nothing folded up in him, and if emitted in barbaric yawps, it is not more filling than Ossian or the east wind.</p><p>W. D. H. </p><p>\u2217 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps.'

It exhibits the effort of an essentially prosaic mind to lift itself, by a prolonged muscular strain, into poetry.

If this were the case, we had been a nation of poets. The constant developments of the war moved us continually to strong feeling and to strong expression of it. But in those cases in which these expressions were written out and printed with all due regard to prosody, they failed to make poetry, as any one may see by consulting now in cold blood the back volumes of the 'Rebellion Record.'2 Of course the city of Manhattan, as Mr. Whitman delights to call it, when regiments poured through it in the first months of the war, and its own sole god, to borrow the words of a real poet, ceased for a while to be the millionaire, was a noble spectacle, and a poetical statement to this effect is possible. Of course the tumult of a battle is grand, the results of a battle tragic, and the untimely deaths of young men a theme for elegies. But he is not a poet who merely reiterates these plain facts ore rotundo. He only sings them worthily who views them from a height. Every tragic event collects about it a number of persons who delight to dwell upon its superficial points\u2014of minds which are bullied by the accidents of the affair. The temper of such minds seems to us to be the reverse of the poetic temper; for the poet, although he incidentally masters, grasps, and uses the superficial traits of his theme, is really a poet only in so far as he extracts its latent meaning and holds it up to common eyes. And yet from such minds most of our war-verses have come, and Mr. Whitman's utterances, much as the assertion may surprise his friends, are in this respect no exception to general fashion. They are an exception, however, in that they openly pretend to be something better; and this it is that makes them melancholy reading. Mr. Whitman is very fond of blowing his own trumpet, and he has made very explicit claims for his book. 'Shut not your doors,' he exclaims at the outset\u2014</p><p>'Shut not your doors to me, proud libraries,<br>For that which was lacking among you all, yet needed most, I bring;<br>A book I have made for your dear sake, O soldiers,<br>And for you, O soul of man, and you, love of comrades;<br>The words of my book nothing, the life of it everything;<br>A book separate, not link'd with the rest, nor felt by the intellect;<br>But you will feel every word, O Libertad! arm'd Libertad!<br>It shall pass by the intellect to swim the sea, the air,<br>With joy with you, O soul of man.'</p><p>These are great pretensions, but it seems to us that the following are even greater:</p><p>'From Paumanok starting, I fly like a bird,<br>Around and around to soar, to sing the idea of all;<br>To the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs,<br>To Kanada, 'till I absorb Kanada in myself\u2014to Michigan then,<br>To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs (they are inimitable);<br>Then to Ohio and Indiana, to sing theirs\u2014to Missouri and Kansas and Arkansas to <br>sing theirs,<br>To Tennessee and Kentucky\u2014to the Carolinas and Georgia, to sing theirs,<br>To Texas, and so along up toward California, to roam accepted everywhere;<br>To sing first (to the tap of the war-drum, if need be)<br>The idea of all\u2014of the western world, one and inseparable,<br>And then the song of each member of these States.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman's primary purpose is to celebrate the greatness of our armies; his secondary purpose is to celebrate the greatness of the city of New York. He pursues these objects through a hundred pages of matter which remind us irresistibly of the story of the college professor who, on a venturesome youth's bringing him a theme done in blank verse, reminded him that it was not customary in writing prose to begin each line with a capital. The frequent capitals are the only marks of verse in Mr. Whitman's writing. There is, fortunately, but one attempt at rhyme. We say fortunately, for if the inequality of Mr. Whitman's lines were self-registering, as it would be in the case of an anticipated syllable at their close, the effect would be painful in the extreme. As the case stands, each line starts off by itself, in resolute independence of its companions, without a visible goal. But if Mr. Whitman does not write verse, he does not write ordinary prose. The reader has seen that liberty is 'libertad.' In like manner, comrade is 'camerado;' Americans are 'Americanos;' a pavement is a 'trottoir,' and Mr. Whitman himself is a 'chansonnier.' If there is one thing that Mr. Whitman is not, it is this, for Beranger3 was a chansonnier. To appreciate the force of our conjunction, the reader should compare his military lyrics with Mr. Whitman's declamations. Our author's novelty, however, is not in his words, but in the form of his writing. As we have said, it begins for all the world like verse and turns out to be arrant prose. It is more like Mr. Tupper's proverbs than anything we have met. But what if, in form, it is prose? it may be asked. Very good poetry has come out of prose before this. To this we would reply that it must first have gone into it. Prose, in order to be good poetry, must first be good prose. As a general principle, we know of no circumstance more likely to impugn a writer's earnestness than the adoption of an anomalous style. He must have something very original to say if none of the old vehicles will carry his thoughts. Of course he may be surprisingly original. Still, presumption is against him. If on examination the matter of his discourse proves very valuable, it justifies, or at any rate excuses, his literary innovation.</p><p>But if, on the other hand, it is of a common quality, with nothing new about it but its manners, the public will judge the writer harshly. The most that can be said of Mr. Whitman's vaticinations is, that, cast in a fluent and familiar manner, the average substance of them might escape unchallenged. But we have seen that Mr. Whitman prides himself especially on the substance\u2014the life\u2014of his poetry. It may be rough, it may be grim, it may be clumsy\u2014such we take to be the author's argument\u2014but it is sincere, it is sublime, it appeals to the soul of man, it is the voice of a people. He tells us, in the lines quoted, that the words of his book are nothing. To our perception they are everything, and very little at that. A great deal of verse that is nothing but words has, during the war, been sympathetically sighed over and cut out of newspaper corners, because it has possessed a certain simple melody. But Mr. Whitman's verse, we are confident, would have failed even of this triumph, for the simple reason that no triumph, however small, is won but through the exercise of art, and that this volume is an offense against art. It is not enough to be grim and rough and careless; common sense is also necessary, for it is by common sense that we are judged. There exists in even the commonest minds, in literary matters, a certain precise instinct of conservatism, which is very shrewd in detecting wanton eccentricities. To this instinct Mr. Whitman's attitude seems monstrous. It is monstrous because it pretends to persuade the soul while it slights the intellect; because it pretends to gratify the feelings while it outrages the taste. The point is that it does this on theory, wilfully, consciously, arrogantly. It is the little nursery game of 'open your mouth and shut your eyes.' Our hearts are often touched through a compromise with the artistic sense, but never in direct violation of it. Mr. Whitman sits down at the outset and counts out the intelligence. This were indeed a wise precaution on his part if the intelligence were only submissive! But when she is deliberately insulted, she takes her revenge by simply standing erect and open-eyed. This is assuredly the best she can do. And if she could find a voice she would probably address Mr. Whitman as follows: 'You came to woo my sister, the human soul. Instead of giving me a kick as you approach, you should either greet me courteously, or, at least, steal in unobserved. But now you have me on your hands. Your chances are poor. What the human heart desires above all is sincerity, and you do not appear to me sincere. For a lover you talk entirely too much about yourself. In one place you threaten to absorb Kanada. In another you call upon the city of New York to incarnate you, as you have incarnated it. In another you inform us that neither youth pertains to you nor 'delicatesse,' that you are awkward in the parlor, that you do not dance, and that you have neither bearing, beauty, knowledge, nor fortune. In another place, by an allusion to your 'little songs,' you seem to identify yourself with the third person of the Trinity. For a poet who claims to sing 'the idea of all,' this is tolerably egotistical. We look in vain, however, through your book for a single idea. We find nothing but flashy imitations of ideas. We find a medley of extravagances and commonplaces. We find art, measure, grace, sense sneered at on every page, and nothing positive given us in their stead. To be positive one must have something to say; to be positive requires reason, labor, and art; and art requires, above all things, a suppression of one's self, a subordination of one's self to an idea. This will never do for you, whose plan is to adapt the scheme of the universe to your own limitations. You cannot entertain and exhibit ideas; but, as we have seen, you are prepared to incarnate them. It is for this reason, doubtless, that when once you have planted yourself squarely before the public, and in view of the great service you have done to the ideal, have become, as you say, 'accepted everywhere,' you can afford to deal exclusively in words. What would be bald nonsense and dreary platitudes in any one else becomes sublimity in you. But all this is a mistake. To become adopted as a national poet, it is not enough to discard everything in particular and to accept everything in general, to amass crudity upon crudity, to discharge the undigested contents of your blotting-book into the lap of the public. You must respect the public which you address; for it has taste, if you have not. It delights in the grand, the heroic, and the masculine; but it delights to see these conceptions cast into worthy form. It is indifferent to brute sublimity. It will never do for you to thrust your hands into your pockets and cry out that, as the research of form is an intolerable bore, the shortest and most economical way for the public to embrace its idols\u2014for the nation to realize its genius\u2014is in your own person. This democratic, liberty-loving, American populace, this stern and war-tried people, is a great civilizer. It is devoted to refinement. If it has sustained a monstrous war, and practised human nature's best in so many ways for the last five years, it is not to put up with spurious poetry afterwards. To sing aright our battles and our glories it is not enough to have served in a hospital (however praiseworthy the task in itself), to be aggressively careless, inelegant, and ignorant, and to be constantly preoccupied with yourself. It is not enough to be rude, lugubrious, and grim. You must also be serious. You must forget yourself in your ideas. Your personal qualities\u2014the vigor of your temperament, the manly independence of your nature, the tenderness of your heart\u2014these facts are impertinent. You must be possessed, and you must strive to possess your possession. If in your striving you break into divine eloquence, then you are a poet. If the idea which possesses you is the idea of your country's greatness, then you are a national poet; and not otherwise.' </p><p>\u2217 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps.'

He has no ear, no sense of the melody of verse. His poems only differ from prose in the lines being cut into length, instead of continuously pointed. As prose, they must be gauged by the sense they contain, the mechanism of verse being either despised by, or out of the reach of the writer. Considered as prose, then, we find in them a poverty of thought, paraded forth with a hubbub of stray words, and accompanied with a vehement self-assertion in the author, that betrays an absence of true and calm confidence in himself and his impulses. Mr. WHITMAN has fortunately better claims on the gratitude of his countrymen than any he will ever derive from his vocation as a poet. What a man does, is of far greater consequence than what he says or prints, and his devotion to the most painful of duties in the hospitals at Washington during the war, will confer honor on his memory when Leaves of Grass are withered and Drum Taps have ceased to vibrate.</p>", "date": "November 22 1865", "year": 1865, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Times", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Drum-Taps].\" 22 November 1865.

We have no mind to laugh at Whitman's poetry. We know that for four years of war he has done noble and beautiful service in the hospitals, bending his shaggy form to a thousand little offices of kindness and shrinking from nothing. But he is not a poet, if we know what a poet is.</p><p>We have supposed that, without imagination, without music, without any revelation of either the beautiful or the sublime, without any intimate and pervading connection between the form and the substance, there could be no poetry. Strong feeling is something, and a keen appreciation of the picturesque and impressive in nature is something, but they alone cannot furnish forth poetry any more than two strings can fitly make a harp. Walt Whitman has these two, and the jagged and battered frame of the instrument he calls his verse holds little else. He is a fervent patriot, a hearty lover of the soldier, a keen, cordial sympathizer with nature, feeling the flow of its kindred currents with vigor and freshness; and he is a thorough rough, but not a singer. It is an easy thing for one who, in camps and marches, on the field of battle and by the side of sick or wounded men, has seen the soldier's heroism, patience, pluck, and simple, sublime repose in his cause and his God\u2014for one who has seen and felt the romance of the war and its strange incidents, its unpainted and unspoken scenes\u2014to think that the unaccustomed tide of feeling which fires the brain and compels the heart, and lights the eye and deepens the voice and hurries the pen and quickens human sympathy wherever it is looked or spoken, is the inspiration of the poet. But when it is this, and nothing more, it is not inspiration, and it results in Walt Whitman in something which\u2014in spite of its grotesque form and occasional sonorous lines and frequent thrilling passages\u2014is commonplace, and must sooner or later die a commonplace's dreary death.</p><p>In our opinion, moreover, this old friend of ours sins in more than the very common mistake of supposing that poetry which is not. He falls into the fatal error of supposing and acting and writing on the supposition that he is, on the whole, the most completely original, authoritative, and indisputable critic of this world and its contents, vain and otherwise, that a hitherto stingy Providence has vouchsafed. In such cases there is generally one safe disposition for the resulting criticism, and that is a hasty consignment to oblivion. But Mr. Whitman deserves more of us, for though he insists that inherently there is no doubt of his vast elevation above the rest of mankind, he is so sturdily good-natured in his assumption, so really sincere in his rapturous self-worship, and so familiar with the ways and words of the world he despises, very weak or a very wicked devotee at his own shrine. The fact is that, with ample chances to be at least a sensible writer, he chooses to be the opposite; and along with some broken, distorted, unfinished thoughts on life and the war, and man and Manhattan, he pours upon us an intolerable flood of Whitman in its crude state and most comfortless forms.</p><p>Mr. Whitman will hardly be a poet in this world if 'Drum Taps' are his best; and we doubt if any man who could be guilty of some of these can be a poet in any world where harmony and beauty in thought and expression are attributes of poetry</p>", "date": "November 23 1865", "year": 1865, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "none", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Drum Taps.\" 23 November 1865.

Walt Whitman is a brawny, sensitive, brave, tender-hearted man, with untrimmed beard and broad shoulders, but as gentle as a girl. He felt the workings of a quaint sort of afflatus years ago, and wrote 'Leaves of Grass,' which Emerson said was 'the best thing America has yet produced,' but which, per contra, prompted Salmon P. Chase to say in a burst of disgust, 'he ought to be hanged for it.' Now he brings out 'Drum Taps' in the same style\u2014a sort of poetic madness without a method. It is little to say of it that it is a bold defiance of good taste, for that is just what it claims to be. It does not merely undertake to subordinate the mind to the feelings, but to ignore the intellectual and \u00e6sthetic altogether. This book, like Leaves of Grass, consists in disjointed exclamations with no attempt at either rhyme or meter\u2014ten thousand unfinished sentences with ten thousand exclamation points at the end. We give a sample.</p><p>'Race of veterans!<br>Race of the soil ready for conflict! race of the conquering march!<br>(No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race!)<br>Race of passion and the storm.'</p><p>That is the whole of one poem!

What shall we say of this person?\u2014that he is an idiot? No; for he is a refined and educated gentleman, an agreeable companion, something of a scholar. Shall we reckon his publishers fools? Hardly; for they sold a large edition of 'Leaves of Grass' which was not a whit better. Moreover, that was justly offensive for its impurities of thought and expression, and there was talk of suppressing it for its immorality. Yet from personal acquaintance we believe Walt Whitman to be a pure man. He is delicate and thoroughly conscientious. He expended the money which he received for 'Leaves of Grass' in the most devoted ministrations to the wounded soldiers during the war, and they loved him as if he had been a mother, and he bore them in his strong arms with the fidelity of an elder brother. He is a moral man; but 'Leaves of Grass' has a bad tendency. He is a learned man, but 'Drum Taps' is utterly without any continous sense, or else an intelligent public is very addle-headed.</p>", "date": "November 28 1865", "year": 1865, "creator": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Drum-Taps].\" 28 November 1865.

It is impossible to sympathize heartily with the greatest thoughts that have found utterance in literature, and not to admire; him. The two ideas which have him in their possession,\u2014the omnipresence of; the soul, and the sacredness of the individual\u2014lie at the roots of poetry and civilization; and he chants them with an invincible faith, which is, of itself, sufficient to place him on a plane beyond that of the poets who believe in art as a finality.</p><p>But to be a Pantheist and a Democrat, does not constitute a claim sufficient to entitle any man to the distinction of being a great poet; and Walt Whitman has no other, save a picturesqueness of phrase unsurpassed in literature, and a powerful rhythm, whose long musical roll is like that of the waves of the sea. For he is not a man of ideas. What is called his sanity, his tenacious grasp on realities, is, after all, the monomania of a man whom a great thought has robbed of his self-possession. The unity of the soul is a key that unlocks all doors, but Walt Whitman stopped at the first one to which he applied it. He celebrates the divinity of matter, and worships the shells of things with such fervor that he almost persuades us that there is no substance behind them. It is a dangerous error. The sphinx, Matter, stands in her terrible beauty before every soul, and no answer to her riddle is more fatal than this. Whisper to her that she is divine, and her smiling lips open surely for your destruction. The idea which led Oriental thinkers to the life of contemplation, and which gives Emerson a serenity like that of the unclouded summer sky, leads this poet to materialism. His songs, though beautiful and inspiring, smack too strongly of the earth. His suggestions are sometimes vast, but himself is chaotic and fragmentary. The truth is that the two ideas which find expression through him are antagonistic. Because the soul is one and all mighty, the individual is nothing. 'I want no masses at all,' says Emerson; but in Whitman the passion for individuals is so strong that it continually wrestles with and overthrows his belief in the universal. Democracy is a good thought to found a state upon, but it is not the profoundest basis for a poem.</p><p>Jefferson may claim that 'all men are born free and equal,' and Whitman may 'accept nothing which all cannot have the counterpart of on the same terms;' but the soul, which does not divide itself impartially through the whole universe, but incarnates itself wholly in each atom, is an aristocrat\u2014does not whiffle about rights and duties\u2014claims all and will not be hindered of its own. Mr. Gradgrind's facts, Walt Whitman's patriotism, the vilest man, the purest saint, are equally sacred, and equally valueless, for they are the stepping- stones only, to the unattainable beyond. Let any man assume the attitude of adoration, no matter how fair the shrine, and his shell instantly hardens around him. And porous as this poet thinks himself to all the influences of the universe, he is prostrated, deaf, dumb and blind, before an idol from which the god has departed.</p><p>And yet, as Thoreau said, he suggests at times something more than human. In his latest volume there are a few passages which contain the very essence of poetry, and are inexpressibly pathetic, moreover, with the yearning humanity that breathes through them. Setting aside his war chants, which are remarkable for nothing but the startling vividness of their pictures, there are certain poems which make one doubt the correctness of the impression made by the whole man. Such, for instance, are the invocation to Death in the poem called 'When last in the dooryard the lilacs bloomed [sic],' 'Chanting the Square Deific,' and 'As I lay with my head in your lap.' If his faith in the unseen were more of a prophetic fury, and less a premeditated and coolly considered belief; if he clung closer to realities and less tenaciously to appearances, he would be the greatest poet of our day. But he hesitates, as he says, with a rare self-appreciation, at the first step in his progress. He shuts himself from hearty sympathy on all sides. His music, his picturesque force avail him little with the poets, while he so persistently produces poetical effects outside of the accepted rules of their art; and his vast ideas fail of half their force to those who, believing in them as faithfully as he, feel that his application of them is limited and material.</p><p>F.</p>", "date": "January 27 1866", "year": 1866, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Saturday Press", "citation": "F.

(Pp. 96.)</p><p>Such is the title of the latest volume of poems by a man of singular genius, Mr. Walter Whitman, of Brooklyn, N. Y. lately displaced from a humble clerkship in Washington by the husband of Mrs. Harlan. In it is included also a smaller collection of verses, called 'Sequel to Drum Taps,' and containing chiefly poems which relate to the death of President Lincoln and the close of the war. The poems called Drum Taps, as the name indicates, relate mostly to the beginning and the progress of the war. Before noticing at any length either these poems or their author, let us make a little comparison which is not without significance.</p><p>Mr. Whitman is a native of New York, a staunch patriot, and through the war, by his services to our soldiers in camp and hospital, has earned the gratitude of tens of thousands of the men who fought and died for their country. He has tenderly cared for the wounded, nursed the sick, consoled the dying and buried the dead. This he did not for pay or for glory\u2014for he got neither\u2014but for love of the sacred cause of freedom and of mankind. He had previously been known to many of his countrymen as a poet of original powers, occupied with the most important themes, which he did not always treat in conformity to the preconceived opinions of the multitude. Having served in his chosen work through the war, both before and after his appointment and dismissal from a clerkship at Washington, he sought in his native city a publisher for his patriotic verses, but he found none willing to put his name to the volume. Messrs. Bunce & Huntington finally printed it, but without their name, and without taking any of customary steps to introduce the book to the reading public. It is scarcely to be got at a bookstore, has hardly been noticed by a newspaper, and, though full of the noblest verses, is utterly unknown to the mass of readers.</p><p>Now, look at another fact. Mr. John Esten Cooke is a Virginian, who early joined the rebellion, in which his State played so prominent a part. He served in the army, and did his noble best to destroy the government and kill our brave soldiers. Being a writer, too, he aided his sword by his pen; and by what passes in Virginia for fine writing, he encouraged his fellow-traitors to prolong their treason. He had been known at the North, too, before the war, as a writer of trashy verses and sensational fiction.</p><p>Whether Mr. Cooke was pardoned by President Johnson at the urgency of Mrs. Cobb, or whether he is still unpardoned, (if he ever rose to the rank which made a pardon necessary,) we do not know. But he has had the effrontery to come to New York with a fourth-rate novel, written in the style of Mrs. Henry Wood, but full of the rankest treason and laudation of traitors, and he, too, has needed a publisher. But he did not wait long. Messrs. Bunce & Huntington, the same who treat Mr. Whitman so cavalierly, are eager to put his trash into the market. They announce it months in advance; they advertise it in all the newspapers; they send advance copies and secure long notices in the leading journals. The Advertiser devotes nearly a column to it; the Evening Post notices it at some length; the Round Table blows a trumpet before and behind it; and other journals pay it the courtesy of a serious review.

In the first poem, for instance, which gives its name to the volume, he describes the arming of New York when the news came of the attack on Fort [illegible]. 'The Lady of this teeming and turbulent city' calls forth her children as bees are called from the hive. She,</p><p>'At dead of night, at news from the South,<br>Incensed, struck with clenched hand the pave-<br>ment,\u2014<br>A shock electric\u2014the night sustained it,<br>Till with ominous hum, our hive at daybreak poured <br>out its myriads.'</p><p>One of the longer poems opens thus, with a melodious verse which yet does not come under any of the rules for English prosody:\u2014</p><p>'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,<br>And the great star early drooped in the western <br>sky in the night,<br>I mourned\u2014and yet shall mourn with ever retur-<br>ning spring.'</p><p>In the 'Dirge for Two Veterans' are these stanzas:\u2014</p><p>'I see a sad procession,<br>And I hear the sound of coming full-keyed bugles;<br>All the channels of the city streets they're flooding<br>As with voices and with tears.</p><p>I hear the great drums pounding,<br>And the small drums steady whirring;<br>And every blow of the great convulsive drum<br>Strikes me through and through.</p><p>Now nearer blow the bugles,<br>And the drums strike more convulsively;<br>And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,<br>And the strong dead-march enwraps me.'</p><p>We have quoted enough to show the power which this poet has to fix his thought in the mind at a single stroke. But what cannot so well be shown by quotations is the broad effect of his poems as a whole; as he says himself,</p><p>'The words of my book nothing, the life of it <br>everything.'</p><p>He has the power which Crawford had in sculpture, and which Church has in painting, of producing in his own way the feeling that the American landscape produces,\u2014a vast and vague delight in the scope of existence on this western hemisphere. This was manifest in Leaves of Grass, but it is still more so here, where the sentiment is more concentrated by the national crisis in which the poems were written.</p><p>Like many of our best poets, however, he is too wilful, and does not conform himself with sufficient patience to the laws of rhythm and proportion in thought or expression. Consequently he is fitfully great, and pleases only at intervals in the details of his composition. He is often as tiresome as Wordsworth in his dull passages, and as rugged as an old English metrical romance. He is full of other faults, too, but they mostly spring from his wilfulness and impatience of rules.</p><p>The complaints made of his earlier poems, that they were coarse and immoral in passages, will not apply to this little volume, which is as free from reproach on this score as Mr. Harlan's hymn-book. It will do much, we are confident, to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds, and to secure him that place in literature during his lifetime which he is sure to hold in the next age.</p>", "date": "February 24 1866", "year": 1866, "creator": "Franklin Bejamin Sanborn", "publication": "The Boston Commonwealth", "citation": "Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Drum-Taps].\" 24 February 1866.

This acute observation has never been more strikingly proved than by the author of the volume before us. The curious and the metaphysical have frequently essayed a complete and accurate definition of the word poetry; but it would be impossible to locate within any of their survey-bills, the strange pastures into which Walt Whitman leads his flocks. And yet the author of 'Leaves of Grass,' is as unquestionably a true poet, as the greatest of his contemporaries. He seems to us more purely permeated with the subtile essence of poetry than almost any other. It is the air he breathes: the very blood of his arteries. With others there are wide vistas of unmitigated prose in their view of life; to this poet, everything in the world is glowing with poetic beauty. Objects which seem so insignificant\u2014so homely and common-place to most of us, he weaves into his poems. We would not, of course, be understood to say that a simple photography of whatever objects pass before us answers the ends of art. The hand which holds the pencil is everything; and all must be so portrayed that we view them from the poet's own high stand-point. This answers the artistic end; and it is vain to deny artistic treatment in Walt Whitman's poems because they are not constructed in accordance with canons previously laid down. The true poet discovers new and unsuspected laws of art, and makes his own rules. If he touches the secret chords of poetry in our soul, that is the only test, whether we can explain it to our own understanding or not.</p><p>'Drum-Taps' contains but few strikingly different characteristics from the author's former volume. We are pleased to find that certain features of that are not introduced in this; for we are compelled to confess that there were certain pages of the 'Leaves of Grass' which we regretted had been written. We have written upon the fly-leaf of our copy this passage from 'The Essays:' 'Osmand had a humanity so broad and deep, that although his speech was so bold and free with the Koran as to disgust all the dervishes, yet was there never a poor outcast, eccentric or insane man, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had been mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his brain, but fled at once to him: that great heart lay there so sunny and hospitable in the centre of the country, that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers drew them to his side.'</p><p>On looking through the pages of 'Drum-Taps,' and catching the soft and sweet strains of a sublime tenderness, much more than the martial music which the title indicates, certain scenes in Washington in the winter of '63 and '64 recur very vividly to memory; his meeting soldiers on the street whom he had nursed and tended\u2014</p><p>'Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested\u2014<br>Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips',\u2014</p><p>walks with him through some of the hospitals, where he came a ministering spirit, daily. It was very affecting to witness the adoration which this divine love kindled.

He has been sneered at and mocked and ridiculed; he has been cursed and caricatured and persecuted, and instead of retorting in a like strain, or growing embittered and misanthropic, he has preserved his serenity and good nature under all, and illustrated the doctrine of charity he has preached by acts of the most pure and disinterested benevolence. Walt Whitman was born on Long Island, N. Y., in the Spring of 1819, and boasts that his tongue and every atom of his blood was formed from this soil, this air. 'Born here of parents born here, from parents the same and their parents' parents the same,' and hence, physiologically, is American to the very marrow of his bones.</p><p>On his father's side, his stock is English; on his mother's, Holland Dutch. From his father he inherits his large frame and muscular build\u2014his antecedents here being a race of farmers and mechanics, silent, good-natured, playing no high part in society, politics or the church, and noted chiefly for strength and size. His early life was passed partly in Brooklyn and partly in the country about forty miles east of Brooklyn, where he lived much in presence of the sea. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty he seems to have been mostly engaged in teaching country schools in his native town and vicinity. It was about this time that he began writing for the press. His first productions, mostly sketches, appeared in the 'Democratic Review,' from which they were copied into some of the newspapers. Between the ages of twenty and thirty, he was variously occupied as writer and editor on the press of New York and Brooklyn, sometimes going into the country and delivering political addresses. During this period he was on familiar terms of acquaintance with William Cullen Bryant, and the two were in the habit of taking long walks, which, of course, were equivalent to long talks, in and about Brooklyn. In 1850 he went to New Orleans in the capacity of editor, where he remained a year. On his trip to and from that city he made it a point to penetrate various parts of the West and Southwest, particularly to explore the Mississippi and its tributaries, searching, one might say, for hints and models to be used in the making of his poems.</p><p>He does not seem to have conceived the idea of writing 'Leaves of Grass' till after his thirtieth year. How he was led to adopt this style of expression, thoroughly versed as he was in the literature of the day, is uncertain. The most probable explanation is, that he felt hampered by the old forms and measures, and saw that if America ever came to possess a style of her own it would be in the direction of more freedom and scope\u2014a feeling in which many of his contemporaries are beginning to share. For three or four years before he began to write in this vein, and while his loaf was leavening, as it were, he was a diligent student of the critical literature of the age, delving into foreign magazines and quarterly reviews, and collecting together a vast amount of matter, bearing upon poetry and literature generally, for further use and study. It is quite probable that this course of reading had some influence in determining his own course as a poet, and that he knew well beforehand wherein the head and front of his offending would lie. It has not been with his eyes shut that he set himself squarely against the popular taste and standards, and wrote for an audience of which he did not count upon the present existence of a single member. It cannot be said with the same force of any other writer, living or dead, that he must 'wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of himself.'</p><p>When 'Leaves of Grass' was written and published, the author was engaged in putting up small frame houses in the suburbs of Brooklyn, partly with his own hands and partly with hired help. The book was still-born. To a small job printing office in that city belongs the honor, if such, of bringing it to light. Some three score copies were deposited in a neighboring book store, and as many more in another book store in New York. Weeks elapsed and not one was sold. Presently there issued requests from both the stores that the thin quarto, for such it was, should be forthwith removed. The copies found refuge in a well-known phrenological publishing house in Broadway, whose proprietors advertised it and sent specimen copies to the journals and to some distinguished persons. The journals remained silent, and several of the volumes sent to the distinguished persons were returned with ironical and insulting notes. The only attention the book received was, for instance, the use of it by the collected attach\u00e9s of a leading daily paper of New York, when at leisure, as a butt and burlesque\u2014its perusal aloud by one of the party being equivalent to peals of ironical laughter from the rest.</p><p>A small but important occurrence seems to have turned the tide. This was the appearance of a letter from the most illustrious literary man in America, brief, but containing a magnificent eulogium of the book. A demand arose, and before many months all the copies of the thin quarto were sold. At the present date, a curious person, poring over the shelves of second-hand book stalls in side places of the city, may light upon a copy of this quarto, for which the stall-keeper will ask him treble its first price. 'Leaves of Grass,' considerably added to, and printed in the new shape of a handy 16mo. of about 350 pages, again appeared in 1857. This edition also sold. The newspaper notices of it both here and in Great Britain were numerous, and nearly all of them scoffing, bitter and condemnatory. The most general charge made was that it had passages of serious indelicacy.</p><p>For the third time, now much enlarged and in a really beautiful typography and accompaniments, these 'Leaves' were issued in Boston as a 12mo. of 456 pages, in 1860. This is their last appearance. An edition of several thousand was taken up, but the business panic of the year, joined with the war, broke down the publishing house that had the book in hand, and the stereotype plates were locked up in chancery. We understand, however, that a new edition is now (August) in the hands of the printer and will shortly be given to the public. This edition will include 'Drum Taps,' and show many changes, both in the text and arrangement of the other poems, and indicate much more clearly the purpose or idea of the poet than any edition heretofore published. The entire carrying out of his plan, however, still contemplates the addition of a series of short pieces, like those called 'Calamus,' expressive of the religious sentiment and aspiration of man.</p><p>The full history of the book, if it could ever be written, would be a very curious one. No American work has ever before excited at once such diametrically opposite judgments, some seeing in it only matter for ridicule and contempt; others, eminent in the walks of literature, regarding it as a great American poem. Its most enthusiastic champions are young men, and students and lovers of nature; though the most pertinent and suggestive criticism of it we have ever seen, and one that accepted it as a whole, was by a lady\u2014one whose name stands high on the list of our poets. Some of the poet's warmest personal friends, also, are women of this mould. On the other hand, the most bitter and vindictive critic of him of whom we have heard was a Catholic priest, who evoked no very mild degree of damnation upon his soul; if, indeed, we except the priestly official at the seat of government who, in administering the affairs of his department, on what he had the complacency to call Christian principles, took occasion, for reason of the poet's literary heresies alone, to expel him from a position in his office. Of much more weight than the opinion of either of these Christian gentlemen is the admiration of that Union soldier we chanced to hear of, who by accident came into possession of the book, and without any previous knowledge of it or its author, and by the aid of his mother wit alone, came to regard it with feelings akin to those which personal friendship and intercourse alone awaken; carrying it in his knapsack through three years of campaigning on the Potomac, and guarding it with a sort of jealous affection from the hands of his comrades.</p><p>It certainly is an astounding book; but if one will face it fairly, it is by no means so hopeless as it would seem. If the book as a whole means anything, it means power, health, freedom, democracy, self-esteem, a full life in the open air, an escape from the old forms and standards, and a declaration for new and enlarged modes, not only in letters, but in life. In other words, 'Leaves of Grass' is the expression in literature of a perfectly healthy, unconventional man; not an abstract, or an intellectual statement of him merely, but the full rendering of a human personality for better or for worse. The poet celebrates himself, that is, uses himself, as an illustration of the character upon which his book is predicated, and which he believes to be typical of the American of the future. This character he has mapped out in bold, strong lines, and in its interest has written his poems. Hence it is not for the man of to-day he has spoken; he has discarded the man of today as effete\u2014has rejected his models and standards, and spoken for what he believes to be the man of the future. He must, therefore, have been well prepared for the reception he has met with. Is it to be expected that current conventionalities will endorse him who seeks their overthrow? If we see correctly, the book is also a terrible reaction against the petty, dainty, drivelling ways into which literature has fallen.</p><p>But to return to our account of the poet himself. Contrary to the hasty opinions of the critics, who mistook the personal element in his poems and their unliterary spirit (the spirit of nature and life is always unliterary) as evidence of the want of culture in their author, he is a man deeply learned in all the great literatures of the world. The Greek dramatists he has read as few moderns have, and knows Homer to his finger ends. The sects and commentators have not spoilt for him that greatest of books, the Bible, which he always has near. And his mastery of the German metaphysicians has not barred his mind to the enjoyment of the other extreme of literature; the stores of ballad poetry, as the Spanish songs of the 'Cid,'1 and Walter Scott's 'Border Minstrelsy,'2 which last is a source of never-failing delight to him. Considering how the critics have fathered him on Emerson, it is valuable to know that he did not make the acquaintance of Emerson's mind till after the publication of the first edition of his poems. Going, as was his wont, to spend a long Summer day by the sea-shore on Coney Island, in those years a place entirely uninhabited, he carried with him in the basket that contained his dinner, three volumes of 'Emerson's Essays,' which a friend had recommended to him. There, on that solitary beach fronting the sea, he that day, for the first time, read Emerson.</p><p>But he has been a reader of men and of things, and a student of America, much more than of books. Fond of cities, he has gone persistently into all their haunts and by-places, not as a modern missionary and reformer, but as a student and lover of men, finding beneath all forms of vice and degradation the same old delicious, yearning creatures, after all.</p><p>Lethargic during an interview, passive and receptive, an admirable listener, never in a hurry, with the air of one who has plenty of leisure, always in perfect repose, imple and direct in manners, a lover of plain, common people, 'meeter of savage and gentleman on equal terms,' temperate, chaste, sweet-breathed, tender and affectionate, of copious friendship, preferring always to meet as flesh and blood, and with a large, summery, motherly soul that shines in all his ways and looks, he is by no means the 'rough' people have been so willing to believe. Fastidious as a high caste Brahmin in his food and personal neatness and cleanliness, well dressed, with a gray, open throat, a deep, sympathetic voice, a kind, genial look, the impression he makes upon you is that of the best blood and breeding. He reminds one of the first men\u2014the beginners; has a primitive, out-door look\u2014not so much from being in the open air as from the texture and quality of his make\u2014a look as of the earth, the sea, or the mountains, and 'is usually taken,' says a late champion of his cause, 'for some great mechanic, or stevedore, or seaman, or grand laborer of one kind or another.' His physiognomy presents very marked features\u2014features of the true antique pattern, almost obsolete in modern faces\u2014seen in the strong, square bridge of his nose, his high arching brows, and the absence of all bulging in his forehead, a face approximating in type to the statued Greek. He does not mean intellect merely, but life; and one feels that he must arrive at his results rather by sympathy and absorption than by hard intellectual processes; by the effluence of power rather than by direct and total application of it. In keeping with this, his poems do not have the character of carefully elaborated specimens\u2014of gems cut and polished by the intellect, but are warm and vascular, like living organisms.</p><p>In the matter of health he is an exception to most known instances. He presents the rare phenomenon of a man giving himself to intellectual labor without suffering the slightest detriment to his physical powers; never knowing dyspepsia, nervousness, ennui, and an entire stranger to headache until his presence in the army hospitals, and his stopping too long consecutively after the battles of the Wilderness, with a collection of gangrened wounds, had inoculated his system with a malignant virus. And this robust bodily health, as we have said, is one key to his poems. The peculiar quality of them\u2014a quality as of the open air, the woods, the shore, we believe to be more or less attributable to this source. The absence of all pettiness, dallying and sentimentalism, follows from a like cause.</p><p>We need not praise him for his patriotism, yet was there ever such a lover of country? He has trailed its entire geography through his poems, courteously saluted every city, great and small, celebrated every phase of its life, the habits of its people, their trades, tools, employments, etc.; has tallied in his poems its vast mass movements, and has not merely predicted, but unhesitatingly counted upon, a future greatness for it absolutely unparalleled in the history of the world.</p><p>Soon after the breaking out of the Rebellion, he was drawn to the seat of war to look after a wounded brother3\u2014a captain in one of the New York regiments -and since that time has been engaged in field and hospital in nourishing the sick and wounded soldiers. Up to a very recent date he was still quietly but steadily occupied in the same ministrations among the few worst specimens that lingered in the hospitals about Washington.</p><p>His theory seems to have been that what the soldiers\u2014many of them becoming worse, and even dying of sheer home-sickness\u2014most needed, was a fresh, cheerful countenance, a strong, hopeful voice, and the atmosphere and presence of a loving and healthy friend. Hence he went among them purely in the spirit of love, distributing small gifts\u2014sometimes of money, books, or papers, sometimes of fruits, delicacies, or special food\u2014now reading aloud to a listening group, now soothing by his presence the worst, and, may be, last moments of some poor sufferer. Many soldiers can be found who aver that he saved their lives out and out. His mere presence was tonic and invigorating.</p><p>The book called 'Drum Taps,' which is the result of the poet's experience in the army and in the hospitals, and to which we propose to devote the remainder of this article, is a little volume of less than a hundred pages, full of warlike passion, singularly blended with as much sadness, perhaps, as was ever printed in a like space.</p><p>Those who know Walt Whitman will not be surprised at his calmness and good nature under the treatment awarded to his previous book, and that he should still display the same confidence in himself, and determination to 'fight it out on that line' that he evinced at first.</p><p>I am more resolute because all have denied me that I could ever have been had all <br>accepted me; I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities, <br>nor ridicule.</p><p>Yet, on the whole, the sadness and solemnity of 'Drum Taps' contrasts strongly with the flushed, exultant, arrogant, fore-noon spirit of 'Leaves of Grass.' Here the thought is of death and suffering, and of the desolation of hearts.</p><p>Though his themes are mostly suggested by our recent war, yet it is evidently not the purpose of the poet to give descriptions of battles and of great campaigns, or to celebrate great leaders and brilliant achievements; but rather to give the human aspects of anguish that follow in the train of war. He has looked deeper into the matter than the critics are willing to believe. He perhaps feels that the permanent condition of modern society is that of peace; that war, as a business, as a means of growth, has served its time, and that, notwithstanding the vast difference between ancient and modern warfare, both in the spirit and in the means, Homer's pictures are essentially true yet, and no additions to them can be made. War can never be to us what it was to Greece, Rome, and, indeed, to the nations of all ages down to the present; never the main fact\u2014the paramount condition, tyrannizing over all the affairs of national and individual life; but only an episode, a passing interruption; and the poet who in our day would be as true to his nation and times as Homer was to his, must treat of it from the standpoint of peace and progress, and even benevolence. Vast armies rise up in a night and disappear in a day\u2014half a million of men, inured to battle and to blood, go back to the avocations of peace without a moment's confusion or delay\u2014indicating clearly the tendency that prevails.</p><p>Also, in obedience to the true democratic spirit, which is the spirit of the times, the attention of the poet is not drawn to the army as a unit\u2014as a tremendous power wielded by a single will, but to the private soldier, the man in the ranks, from the farm, the shop, the mill, the mine, still a citizen engaged in the sacred warfare of peace. Always and always the individual, this is the modern doctrine, as opposed to slavery and caste and the results of the feudal world.</p><p>Hence those of the poet's friends who expected to find in this little volume all the 'pomp and circumstance of glorious war' have been disappointed. Apostrophizing the genius of America, he says:</p><p>No poem proud I chanting bring to thee\u2014nor mastery's rapturous verse;<br>But a little book containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,<br>And psalms of the dead.</p><p>His aim does not permit of the slightest expression of partisan or sectional feeling, or any exultation over a fallen foe. Under the head of 'Reconciliation' are these lines:</p><p>Word over all, beautiful as the sky:<br>Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly lost;<br>That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly, softly wash again, and ever <br>again, this soil'd world;<br>For my enemy is dead\u2014a man divine as myself is dead;<br>I look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin\u2014I draw near;<br>I bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.</p><p>The following lines express with great vividness and force the feeling in which all true patriots shared during the second year of the war:</p><p>Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!<br>Your Summer wind was warm enough\u2014yet the air I breathed froze me;<br>A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me;<br>Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself;<br>Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?<br>And sullen hymns of defeat?</p><p>The poem on page 71 is so full of an overmastering pathos; and displays so well the poet's peculiar method and spirit, that we give it entire:</p><p>Pensive, on her dead gazing, I heard the Mother of All,<br>Desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle-fields gazing;<br>As she call\u2019d to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk\u2019d:<br>Absorb them well, O my earth, she cried\u2014I charge you, lose not my sons! lose not an <br>atom;</p><p>And you streams, absorb them well, taking their dear blood;<br>And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly,<br>And all you essences of soil and growth\u2014and you, my rivers\u2019 depths;<br>And you, mountain sides\u2014and the woods where my dear children\u2019s blood, trickling, <br>redden\u2019d;</p><p>And you trees, down in your roots, to bequeath to all future trees,<br>My dead absorb\u2014my young men\u2019s beautiful bodies absorb\u2014and their precious, precious, <br>precious blood;</p><p>Which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again give me, many a year hence,<br>In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence;<br>In blowing airs from the fields, back again give me my darlings\u2014give my immortal <br>heroes;</p><p>Exhale me them centuries hence\u2014breathe me their breath\u2014let not an atom be lost;<br>O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!<br>Exhale them perennial, sweet death, years, centuries hence.</p><p>Or again in this:</p><p>Look down, fair moon, and bathe this scene;<br>Pour softly down night's nimbus floods, on faces ghastly, swollen, purple;<br>On the dead, on their backs, with their arms toss'd wide,<br>Pour down your unstinted nimbus, sacred moon.</p><p>The following exquisite stanza illustrates the poet's power to give a human interest to inanimate objects, and his biblical largeness and freedom in the use of metaphors:</p><p>Bathed in war's perfume\u2014delicate flag!<br>O to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers! flag like a beautiful woman!<br>O to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men! O the ships they arm with <br>joy!</p><p>O to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships!<br>O to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks!<br>Flag like the eyes of women.</p><p>We invite the reader's careful consideration of one more piece, in which the poet's subtle art and large range of sympathies are perhaps best seen\u2014the poem commemorating the death of Lincoln, beginning, 'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed.' This poem must not be dismissed with a single perusal\u2014a caution, indeed, which may well be observed in reference to the whole book. For, let it be understood, we are dealing with one of the most tyrannical and exacting of bards\u2014one who steadfastly refuses to be read in any but his own spirit. It is only after repeated readings and turning to him again and again, that the atmosphere he breathes is reached. 'You must Summer and Winter with people to know them,' says an old proverb, which is especially true of this poet. The piece referred to is like intricate and involved music, with subtle, far-reaching harmonies. By that curious indirect method which is always the method of nature, the poet makes no reference to the mere facts of Lincoln's death\u2014neither describes it, or laments it, or dwells upon its unprovoked atrocity, or its political aspects, but quite beyond the possibilities of the art of the ordinary versifier, he seizes upon three beautiful facts of nature which he weaves into a wreath for the dead President's tomb. The central thought is of death, but around this he curiously twines, first the early blooming lilacs which the poet may have plucked the day the dark shadow came; next the song of the hermit thrush, the most sweet and solemn of all our songsters, heard at twilight in the dusky cedars; and with these the evening star, which, as many may remember, night after night in the early part of that eventful Spring, hung low in the west with unusual lustre and brightness. These are the premises whence he starts his solemn chant.</p><p>The poem may disappoint on the first perusal. The treatment of the subject is so unusual\u2014so unlike the direct and prosy style to which our ears have been educated\u2014that it seems to want method and purpose. It eludes one; it hovers and hovers and will not be seized by the mind, though the soul feels it. But it presently appears that this is precisely the end contemplated by the poet. He would give as far as possible the analogy of music, knowing that in that exalted condition of the sentiments at the presence of death in a manner so overwhelming, the mere facts or statistics of the matter are lost sight of, and that it is not a narrative of the great man's death, done into rhyme, however faultless, or an eulogy upon his character, however just and discriminating, that offers an opportunity for the display of the highest poetic art, or that would be the most fitting performance on an occasion so august and solemn. Hence the piece has little or none of the character of the usual productions on such occasions. It is dramatic, yet there is no procession of events or development of plot, but a constant interplay\u2014a turning and re-turning of images and sentiments, so that the section in which is narrated how the great shadow fell upon the land occurs far along in the piece. It is a poem that may be slow in making admirers, yet it is well worth the careful study of every student of literature.</p><p>Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,<br>Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>With the pomp of the inloop\u2019d flags, with the cities draped in black,<br>With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil\u2019d women, standing,<br>With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,<br>With the countless torches lit\u2014with the silent sea of faces, and the unbared heads,<br>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn;<br>With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pour\u2019d around the coffin,<br>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs\u2014Where amid these you journey,<br>With the tolling, tolling bells\u2019 perpetual clang;<br>Here! coffin that slowly passes,<br>I give you my sprig of lilac.</p><p>(Nor for you, for one, alone;<br>Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring:<br>For fresh as the morning\u2014thus would I carol a song for you, O sane and sacred death.</p><p>All over bouquets of roses,<br>O death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies;<br>But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,<br>Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes;<br>With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,<br>For you, and the coffins all of you, O death.)</p><br><p>O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?<br>And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?<br>And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love?</p><p>Sea-winds, blown from east and west,<br>Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies <br>meeting:<br>These, and with these, and the breath of my chant,<br>I perfume the grave of him I love.</p><p>O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?<br>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,<br>To adorn the burial-house of him I love?</p><p>Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,<br>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,<br>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expand-<br>ing the air;</p><p>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees pro-<br>lific;</p><p>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and <br>there;</p><p>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows;<br>And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.</p><p>The poem reaches, perhaps, its height in the matchless invocation to Death:</p><p>Come, lovely and soothing Death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate Death.</p><p>Prais\u2019d be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;<br>And for love, sweet love\u2014But praise! O praise and praise<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death,</p><p>Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee\u2014I glorify thee above all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.</p><p>Approach, strong Deliveress!When it is so\u2014when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.</p><p>From me to thee glad serenades,<br>Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee\u2014dornments and feastings for thee;<br>And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting,<br>And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.</p><p>The night, in silence, under many a star;<br>The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know;<br>And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil\u2019d Death,<br>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.</p><p>The gravity and seriousness of this book and its primitive untaught ways are entirely new in modern literature. With all our profuse sentimentalism, there is no deep human solemnity\u2014the solemnity of a strong, earnest affectionate, unconventional man\u2014in our literature. There are pathos and tears and weeds of mourning; but we would indicate an attitude or habit of the soul which is not expressed by melancholy\u2014which is no sudden burst, or fit, or spasm\u2014which is not inconsistent with cheerfulness and good nature, but which is always coupled with these\u2014a state or condition induced by large perceptions, faith, and deep human sympathies. It may be further characterized as impatient of trifles and dallyings, tires even of wit and smartness, dislikes garrulity and fiction and all play upon words, and is but one remove from silence itself. The plainness and simplicity of the biblical writers afford the best example.</p><p>Contemplation, without love or sympathy, of the foibles, follies, and fashions of men and women and of their weaknesses and oddities begets the punning, scoffing, caricaturing habit we deprecate; contemplation of the laws and movements of society, the shows and processes of nature and issues of life and death, begets the rugged faith and sweet solemnity we would describe in 'Drum Taps.'</p><p>The reader perceives that the quality of these poems is not in any word, or epithet, or metaphor, or verbal and labial felicity whatever; but in the several atmospheres they breathe and exhale. The poet does not aim to load his pages with sweets\u2014he makes no bouquets, distils no perfumes\u2014whatever flower-scents there are, are lost in a smell as of the earth, the shore, the woods. Fine writing, with him, goes for naught. He seeks neither to please nor startle, nor even convince any more than nature does; and beauty follows, if at all, never as the aim, always as the result. There are none of the generally sought for, and, when found, much applauded, delicate fancies or poetical themes\u2014but a large and loving absorption of whatever the earth holds. And this leads us to our final remark upon this subject, in making which we mean discredit to none.</p><p>It seems to us that Walt Whitman possesses almost in excess, a quality in which every current poet is lacking. We mean the faculty of being in entire sympathy with nature, and the objects and shows of nature, and of rude, abysmal man; and appalling directness of utterance therefrom, without any intermediate agency or modification.</p><p>The influence of books and works of art upon an author may be seen in all respectable writers. If knowledge alone made literature, or culture genius, there would be no dearth of these things among the moderns. But we feel bound to say that there is something higher and deeper than the influence or perusal of any or all books, or all other productions of genius\u2014a quality of information which the masters can never impart, and which all the libraries do not hold. This is the absorption by an author, previous to becoming so, of the spirit of nature, through the visible objects of the universe, and his affiliation with them subjectively and objectively. The calm, all-permitting, wordless spirit of nature yet so eloquent to him who hath ears to hear! The sunrise, the heaving sea, the woods and mountains, the storm and the whistling winds, the gentle Summer day, the Winter sights and sounds, the night and the high dome of stars\u2014to have really perused these, especially from childhood onward, till what there is in them so impossible to define finds its full mate and echo in the mind\u2014his only is the lore which breathes the breath of life into all the rest. Without it, literary productions may have the superb beauty of statues, but with it only can they have the beauty of life.</p><p>JOHN BURROUGHS.</p>", "date": "December 1 1866", "year": 1866, "creator": "John Burroughs", "publication": "Galaxy", "citation": "Burroughs, John. \"Walt Whitman And His 'Drum Taps'.\" 1 December 1866.

WALT WHITMAN's Drum-Taps New York. 1865. 12mo. pp. 72.</p><p>2. Sequel to Drum-Taps. (Since the preceding came from the Press.) When Lilacs last in the Dooryard bloomed, and Other Pieces</p><p>IT is fortunate that 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps,' unlike his 'Leaves of Grass,' is in point of propriety unexceptionable, so that it can be judged on its intrinsic merits.</p><p>The pieces of which 'Drum-Taps' consists are in form, like those in 'Leaves of Grass,' neither blank verse nor rhythmical prose. A poet of genuine artistic power would suffer from the absence of those restraints which are to genius what its banks are to a river,\u2014limitations that aid in the development of beauty and of force; and Mr. Whitman is so far from being an artist, that he boasts of his lack of culture, after the fashion of 'self-made' men. Yet it is precisely this deficiency which disguises his real excellence, and stands between him and the fame he predicts for himself. A writer whose works are to live must have taste to discriminate between what is worth saying in a given poem, and what is not worth saying, and must have courage to excise the latter. The business of cataloguing the works of creation should be left to the auctioneer.</p><p>Poets of vastly more genius and culture than Mr. Whitman possesses have committed the error of thinking all objects and fancies equally worthy of a poem. Wordsworth, for example, patched his shining robes with homespun; but Wordsworth had the manners and speech of a gentleman, while Whitman has the characteristics, good and bad, of a Bowery boy. His love of New York City has more in common with Gavroche's love for Paris than with that of Victor Hugo, and more in common with Tony Weller's love for London than with that of Dr. Johnson, Lamb, or even Dickens. His glorification of America smacks of the 'We can lick all creation' of Tammany Hall. But with the extravagance, coarseness, and general 'loudness' of Bowery boys, Mr. Whitman possesses in an unusual degree their better traits. He is not ashamed of the body he lives in, and he calls all things by plain names. His compositions, without being sentimental or pretty, show genuine sensibility to the beauty of nature and of man. His braggart patriotism evinced its genuineness during the war.</p><p>'Beauty, knowledge, fortune, inure not to me, yet there are two things inure to me.<br>I have nourished the wounded and soothed many a dying soldier;<br>And at intervals I have strung together a few songs,<br>Fit for war and the life of a camp.'</p><p>The fact that the 'songs' in Drum-Taps were written under such circumstances ought to have rebutted in the most fastidious minds whatever presumption may have been raised against the volume by previous publications.</p><p>But the claims of these productions to consideration rest upon a more solid basis than the author's personal services in the hospital. Mr. Whitman not only possesses an almost photographic accuracy of observation, a masculine directness of expression, and real tenderness of feeling, but he sometimes hits upon an original epithet which illuminates a page of prosaic details. He speaks of 'the sturdy artillery\u2026soon, unlimbered to begin the red business'; 'the hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted, robust year' (1861); the 'hinged knees and steady hand' of the dresser of wounds; the 'elderly (sick) man, so gaunt and grim, with well-grayed hair and flesh all sunken about the eyes'; 'million-footed, superb-faced Manhattan'; 'the wind with girlish laughter'; the 'gentle, soft-born, measureless light'; 'the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air'; 'the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty'; 'the huge and thoughtful night.' And in at least three places he shows more sustained, if not higher power. The effect of the news from Sumter upon New York is thus described:\u2014</p><p>'The Lady of this teeming and turbulent city,<br>Sleepless, amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,<br>With her million children around her\u2014suddenly<br>At dead of night, at news from the South,<br>Incensed , struck with clenched hand the pavement.'</p><p>'Old Ireland' is personified as</p><p>'Crouching over a grave, an ancient, sorrowful mother,<br>Once a queen,now lean and tattered, seated on the ground,<br>Her old white hair drooping dishevelled round her shoulders;<br>At her feet fallen an unused royal harp.'<br><p>But Mr. Whitman's faculty is, perhaps, most fully shown in the poem entitled, 'When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloomed'; in which the contrast of the beauty and life of the opening spring with the scenes presented and the thoughts awakened by the funeral of Abraham Lincoln is drawn with unexpected power. The poem is, as a whole, remarkable, but we must content ourselves with a brief quotation.</p><p>'Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities;<br>Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes\u2014passing the endless grass;<br>Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown <br>fields uprising;<br>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave<br>Night and day journeys a coffin.<br>. . . . .<br>Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>With the pomp of the inloop\u2019d flags, with the cities draped in black,<br>With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil\u2019d women, standing,<br>With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,<br>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>With all the mournful voices of the dirges, poured around the coffin,<br>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs\u2014Where amid these you journey,<br>With the tolling, tolling bells\u2019 perpetual clang,<br>Here! coffin that slowly passes,<br>I give you my sprig of lilac.</p>", "date": "January 1867", "year": 1867, "creator": "A.S.

Luckily, the man is strong enough, sane enough, to take both abuse and panegyric with calmness. He believes hugely in himself, and in the part he is destined to take in American affairs. He is neither to be put down by prudes, nor tempted aside by the serenade of pipes and timbrels. A large, dispassionate, daring, and splendidly-proportioned animal, he remains unmoved, explanatory up to a certain point, but sphinx-like when he is questioned too closely on morality or religion. Yet when the enthusiastic and credulous, the half-formed, the inquiring, youth of a nation begin to be carried away by a man's teachings, it is time to inquire what these teachings are; for assuredly they are going to exercise extraordinary influence on life and opinion. Now, it is clear, on the best authority, that the writer in question is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates\u2014his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. What the man is, and what the ministry implies, it will not take long to explain. Let it be admitted at the outset, however, that we are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capability for good.</p><p>Sprung from the masses, as he himself tells us, Walt Whitman has for many years lived a vagabond life, labouring, as the humour seized him, and invariably winning his bread by actual and persistent industry. He has been alternately a farmer, a carpenter, a printer. He has been a constant contributor of prose to the Republican journals. He appears, moreover, at intervals, to have wandered over the North American continent, to have worked his way from city to city, and to have consorted liberally with the draff of men on bold and equal conditions. Before the outbreak of the war, he was to be found dwelling in New York, on 'fish-shape Paumanok,' basking there in the rays of the almost tropical sun, or sallying forth into the streets to mingle with strange companions\u2014from the lodging-house luminary and the omnibus driver, down to the scowling rowdy of the wharf bars. Having written his first book, 'Leaves of Grass,' he set it up with his own hands, in a printing-office in Brooklyn. Some of our readers may dimly remember how the work was briefly noticed by contemporary English reviews, in a way to leave the impression that the writer was a wild maniac, with morbid developments in the region of the os pelvis. On the outbreak of the great rebellion, he followed in the rear of the great armies, distinguishing himself by unremitting attention to the wounded in the Ambulance Department, until, on receiving a clerkship in the Department of the Interior, he removed to Washington. Here, to the great scandal of American virtue, he continued to vagabondize as before, but without neglecting his official duties. At the street corner, at the drinking-bar, in the slums, in the hospital wards, the tall figure of Walt Whitman was encountered daily by the citizens of the capital. He knew everybody, from the President down to the crossing-sweeper.</p> <p>'Well,' said Abraham Lincoln, watching him as he stalked by, 'he looks like a man.'</p><p>Latterly, his loafing propensities appear to have grown too strong for American tolerance, and he was ejected from his clerkship, on the pretext that he had written 'indecent verses,' and was a 'free lover.' His admirers, indignant to a man at this treatment, have accumulated protest upon protest, enumerating numberless instances of his personal goodness and self-denial, and laying powerful emphasis on certain deeds which, if truly chronicled, evince a width of sympathy and a private influence unparalleled, perhaps, in contemporary history. With all this personal business we have no concern. His admirers move for a new trial on the evidence of his written works, and to that evidence we must proceed.</p><p>In about ten thousand lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence, Walt Whitman professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man, and, more particularly, indicating the great elements which distinguish American freedom from the fabrics erected by European politicians. Starting from Paumanok, where he was born, he takes mankind in review, and sees everywhere but one wondrous life\u2014the movement of the great masses, seeking incessantly under the sun for guarantees of personal liberty. He respects no particular creed, admits no specific morality prescribed by the civil law, but affirms in round terms the universal equality of men, subject to the action of particular revolutions, and guided en masse by the identity of particular leaders. The whole introduction is a reverie on the destiny of nations, with an undertone of forethought on the American future, which is to contain the surest and final triumph of the democratical man. A new race is to arise, dominating previous ones, and grander far, with new contests, new politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts. But how dominating? By the perfect recognition of individual equality, by the recognition of the personal responsibility and spiritual significance of each being, by the abrogation of distinctions such as set barriers in the way of perfect private action\u2014action responsible only to the being of whom it is a consequence, and inevitably controlled, if diabolic, by the combined action of masses.</p><p>Briefly, Walt Whitman sees in the American future the grandest realization of centuries of idealism\u2014equable distribution of property, luminous enlargement of the spiritual horizon, perfect exercise of all the functions; no apathy, no prudery, no shame, none of that worst absenteeism wherein the soul deserts its proper and ample physical sphere, and sallies out into the regions of the impossible and the unknown. Very finely, indeed, does the writer set forth the divine functions of the body\u2014the dignity and the righteousness of a habitation existing only on the condition of personal exertion; and faintly, but truly, does he suggest how from that personal exertion issues spirituality, fashioning literatures, dreaming religions, and perfecting arts. 'I will make,' he exclaims, 'the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems; and I will make the poems of my body and of mortality: for I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.'</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Having broadly premised, describing the great movements of masses, Walt Whitman proceeds, in a separate 'poem' or 'book,' to select a member of the great democracy, representing typically the privileges, the immunities, the conditions, and the functions of all the rest. He cannot, he believes, choose a better example than himself so he calls this poem 'Walt Whitman.' He is for the time being, and for poetical purposes, the cosmical Man, an entity, a representative of the great forces.\u2020 He describes the delight of his own physical being, the pleasure of the senses, the countless sensations through which he communicates with the material universe. All, he says, is sweet\u2014smell, taste, thought, the play of his limbs, the fantasies of his mind; every attribute is welcome, and he is ashamed of none. He is not afraid of death; he is content to change, if it be the nature of things that he should change, but it is certain that he cannot perish. He pictures the pageant of life in the country and in cities; all is a fine panorama, wherein mountains and valleys, nations and religions, genre, pictures and gleams of sunlight, babes on the breast and dead men in shrouds, pyramids and brothels, deserts and populated streets, sweep wonderfully by him. To all those things he is bound:\u2014wherever they force him, he is not wholly a free agent; but on one point he is very clear\u2014that, so far as he is concerned, he is the most important thing of all. He has work to do; life is not merely a suck or a sell; nay, the whole business of ages has gone on with one object only\u2014that he, the democrat, Walt Whitman, might have work to do. In these very strange passages, he proclaims the magnitude of the preparations for his private action:\u2014</p><p>'Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?</p><p>What is a man, anyhow?

We have chosen an extract where the utterance is unusually clear and vivid. But more extraordinary, in their strong sympathy, are the portions describing the occupations of men. In a few vivid touches we have striking pictures; the writer shifts his identity like Proteus, but breathes the same deep undertone in every shape. He can transfer himself into any personality, however base. 'I am the man\u2014I suffered\u2014I was there.' He cares for no man's pride. He holds no man unclean.</p><p>And afterwards, in the poem called 'Children of Adam,' he proceeds to particularize the privileges of flesh, and to assert that in his own personal living body there is no uncleanness. He sees that the beasts are not ashamed; why, therefore, should he be ashamed? Then comes passage after passage of daring animalism; the functions of the body are unhesitatingly described, and the man asserts that the basest of them is glorious. All the stuff which offended American virtue is to be found here. It is very coarse, but, as we shall see, very important. It is never, however, inhuman; indeed, it is strongly masculine\u2014unsicklied by Lesbian bestialities and Petronian abominations. It simply chronicles acts and functions which, however unfit for art, are natural, sane, and perfectly pure. We shall attempt to show further on that Walt Whitman is not an artist at all, not a poet, properly so called; and that this grossness, offensive in itself, is highly significant\u2014an essential part of very imperfect work. The general question of literary immorality need not be introduced at all. No one is likely to read the book who is not intelligently chaste, or who is not familiar with numberless authors offensive to prudes\u2014Lucretius, Virgil, Dante, Goethe, Byron, among poets; Tacitus, Rabelais, Montaigne, Cervantes, Swedenborg, among prose thinkers.</p><p>The remainder of 'Leaves of Grass' is occupied with poems of democracy, and general monotonous prophecies. There is nothing more which it would serve our present purpose to describe in detail, or to interpret. The typical man continues his cry, encouraging all men,\u2014on the open road, in the light of day, in the region of dreams. All is right with the world, he thinks. For religion he advises, 'Reverence all things'; for morality, 'Be not ashamed'; for political wisdom among peoples, 'Resist much\u2014obey little.' He has no word for art; it is not in her temple that he burns incense. His language, as even a short extract has showed, is strong, vehement, instantaneously chosen; always forcible, and sometimes even rhythmical, like the prose of Plato. Thoughts crowd so thick upon him, that he has no time to seek their artistic equivalent; he utters his thought in any way, and his expressions gain accidental beauty from the glamour of his sympathy. As he speaks, we more than once see a man's face at white heat, and a man's hand beating down emphasis at the end of periods. He is inspired, not angry; yet as even inspiration is not infallible, he sometimes talks rank nonsense.</p><p>The second part of the volume, 'Drum-Taps,' is a series of poetic soliloquies on the war. It is more American and somewhat less mystical than the 'Leaves of Grass'; but we have again the old cry of democracy. Here, in proportion to the absence of self-consciousness, and the presence of vivid emotion, we find absolute music, culminating once or twice in poetry. The monody on the death of Lincoln\u2014'when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed'\u2014contains the three essentials of poetic art\u2014perfect vision, supreme emotion, and true music. This, however, is unusual in Walt Whitman. Intellectual self-consciousness generally coerces emotion, insincerities and follies ensue, and instead of rising into poetry, the lines wail monotonously, and the sound drops into the circle of crabbed prose.</p><p>For there is this distinction between Walt Whitman and the poet\u2014that Whitman is content to reiterate his truth over and over again in the same tones, with the same result; while the poet, having found a truth to utter, is coerced by his artistic sympathies into seeking fresh literary forms for its expression. 'Bawling out the rights of man,' wrote Horne Tooke, 'is not singing.' Artistic sympathies Walt Whitman has none; he is that curiously-crying bird\u2014a prophet with no taste. He is careless about beautifying his truth: he is heedless of the new forms\u2014personal, dramatic, lyrical\u2014in which another man would clothe it, and in which his disciples will be certain to clothe it for him. He sees vividly, but he is not always so naturally moved as to sing exquisitely. He has the swagger of the prophet, not the sweetness of the musician. Hence all those crude metaphors and false notes which must shock artists, those needless bestialities which repel prudes, that general want of balance and that mental dizziness which astonish most Europeans.</p><p>But when this has been said, all blame has been said, if, after all, a man is to incur blame for not being quite another sort of being than nature made him. Walt Whitman has arisen on the States to point the way to new literatures. He is the plain pioneer, pickaxe on shoulder, working and 'roughing.' The daintier gentlemen will follow, and build where he is delving.</p><p>Whitman himself would be the first to denounce those loose young gentlemen who admire him vaguely because he is loud and massive, gross and colossal, not for the sake of the truth he is teaching, and the grandeur of the result that may ensue. There are some men who can admire nothing unless it is 'strong'; intellectual dram-drinkers, quite as far from the truth as sentimental tea-drinkers. Let it at once and unhesitatingly be admitted that Whitman's want of art, his grossness, his tall talk, his metaphorical word-piling, are faults\u2014prodigious ones; and then let us turn reverently to contemplate these signs which denote his ministry, his command of rude forces, his nationality, his manly earnestness, and, last and greatest, his wondrous sympathy with men as men. In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. He emerges from the mass of unwelded materials\u2014in shape much like the Earth-spirit in Faust. He is loud and coarse, like most prophets, 'sounding,' as he himself phrases it, 'his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' He is the voice of which America stood most in need\u2014a voice at which ladies scream and gigmen titter, but which clearly pertains to a man who means to be heard. He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied, but not perhaps to be beheld till the vast American democracy has subsided a little from its last and grandest struggle. Honour in his generation is of course his due, but he does not seem to solicit honour. He is too thoroughly alive to care about being tickled into activity, too excited already to be much moved by finding himself that most badgered of functionaries, the recognized Sir Oracle.</p><p>\u2217 Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass,' 'Drum-Taps,' etc New York, 1867.</p><p>\u2020Let it be understood, here and elsewhere, that we shall attach our own significance to passages in themselves sufficiently mystical.

The plates of the three uniform volumes comprising Whitman's writings are used, but with the broad margins and finer paper of the uncut sheets, the guise seems an entirely new one. The text has received a final revision, there is the charm of certain additions, there are several portraits of Whitman ranging from his early prime to one taken in his 70th year, and there is the great value of the direct association of the poet's personality, as guaranteed in the words of the handsome title page, with its fine profile reproduced from a photograph: Complete Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman. 1855-1888. Authenticated and Personal Book (Handled by W. W.) Portraits from Life. Autograph. On the first fly leaf of the copy before the writer are the words, written in the poet's familiar hand: 'S\u2014\u2014B \u2014\u2014, from his friend, the author, Walt Whitman, with affection and memories.\u2014Dec. 21, 1888.' The handwriting is strikingly firm and bold, showing that the paralysis that afflicts the author has not affected his firm hand.</p><p>The cover is a plain one, with marbled sides and back of dark olive, with the title pasted on in plain white paper: Walt Whitman, Complete Poems and Prose\u2014Leaves of Grass, Specimen Days and Collect, November Boughs with Sands at Seventy, Annex to L. of G.\u2014Portraits from Life, and Autograph Ed'n 1888-9. Altogether, the volume combines the homely democratic simplicity associated with Whitman's name with the essential features of a handsome book\u2014a worthy garment for the great thoughts presented. The note at the end, written for this edition on Nov. 13, 1888, states the author's motives for publishing it, and may be called</p><p><strong>His Literary Valedictory.</strong></p><p>'As I conclude\u2014and (to get typographical correctness,) after running my eyes diligently through the three big divisions of the preceding volume\u2014the interrogative wonder-fancy rises in me whether (if it be not too arrogant to even state it), the 33 years of my current time, 1855-1888, with their aggregate of our new world doings and people, have not, indeed, created and formulated the foregoing leaves\u2014forcing their utterance as the pages stand\u2014coming actually from the direct urge and developments of those years, and not from any individual epic or lyrical attempts whatever, or from my pen or voice, or any body's special voice. Out of that supposition the book might be considered an autochthonic record, and expression, fully rendered, of and out of these 30 to 35 years\u2014of the soul and evolution of America\u2014and, of course, by reflection, not ours only, but more or less of the common people of the world. Seems to me I may dare to claim a deep native tap root for the book, too, in some sort. I came on the stage too late for personally knowing much of even the lingering revolutionary worthies\u2014the men of '76. Yet, as a little boy, I have been pressed tightly and lovingly to the breast of Lafayette (Brooklyn, 1825), and have talked with old Aaron Burr, and also with those who knew Washington and his surroundings, and with original Jeffersonians, and more than one very old soldier and sailor. And in my own day and maturity, my eyes have seen and ears heard, Lincoln, Grant and Emerson, and my hands have been grasped by their hands. Though in a different field and range from most of theirs, I give the foregoing pages as perfectly legitimate, resultant, evolutionary and consistent with them. If these lines should ever reach some reader of a far-off future age, let him take them as a missive sent from Abraham Lincoln's fateful age. Repeating, parrot-like, what in the preceding divisions has been already said, and must serve as a great reason why of this whole book\u2014first, that the main part about pronounced events and shows (poems and persons, also) is the point of view from which they are viewed and estimated: and second, that I cannot let my momentous, stormy, peculiar era of peace and war, these states, these years, slip away without arresting some of its specimen events\u2014even its vital breaths\u2014to be portrayed and inscribed from out of the midst of it, from its own days and nights\u2014not so much in themselves (statistically and descriptively our times are copiously noted and memorandized with an industrial zeal), but to give from them here their flame-like results in imaginative and spiritual suggestiveness, as they present themselves to me, at any rate, from the point of view alluded to.</p><p>'Then a few additional words yet to this hurried farewell note. In another sense (the warp crossing the woof and knitted in) the book is probably a sort of autobiography, an element I have not attempted especially to restrain or erase. As alluded to at the beginning, I had about got the volume well started by the printers, when a sixth recurrent attack of my war paralysis fell upon me. It has proved the most serious and continued of the whole. I am now uttering</p><p><strong>''November Boughs'</strong></p><p>and printing this book in my 70th year. To get out the collection\u2014mainly the born results of health, flush life, buoyancy and happy outdoor volition\u2014and to prepare the Boughs have beguiled my invalid months the past summer and fall. ('Are we to be beaten down in our old age?' says one white-haired old fellow remonstratingly to another in a budget of letters I read last night.) \u2217\u2217\u2217 Then I wanted to leave something markedly personal. I have put my name with pen and ink with my own hand in the present volume. And from engraved or photographed portraits, taken from life, I have selected some, of different stages, which please me best, (or at any rate displease me least), and bequeath them at a venture to you, reader, with my love. W. W., Nov. 13, 1888.'</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' has the following prefatory verses in this volume:</p><p>'Come, said my soul,<br>Such verses for my body let us write (for we <br>are one),<br>That should I after death invisibly return,<br>Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,<br>There to some group of mates the chants re-<br>suming,<br>(Tallying earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultu-<br>ous waves.)<br>Ever with pleased smile I may keep on.<br>Ever and ever yet the verses owning\u2014as, <br>first, I here and now,<br>Signing for soul and body, set to them my<br> name,</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.'</p><p>The second book, 'Specimen Days and Collect,' contains two things which alone would make it invaluable, the preface to the first issue of 'Leaves of Grass,' that of 1855, and the great essay, 'Democratic Vistas.' Since Whitman included verse only in the final form of 'Leaves of Grass' the original preface is given in the prose book. It is known as a masterpiece of composition in the grand style. Its thoughts borne free on the wings of a spontaneous rhythm. Many of its passages will be recognized as having been worked over into later poems. 'Democratic Vistas' is one of the greatest essays ever written concerning America. Whitman speaks here as a seer. Probably no one has ever taken a more comprehensive, far-seeing national view. It is a paper for statesmen in the highest sense. With his healthy, strong, optimistic mind, he looks far ahead through the centuries and perceives the grand destiny of our country, but this does not make him ignore the shadows of the picture, and the very clearness of his prophetic vision shows to him, also, the plainer the perils that beset the road to the goal, as in these words of warning: 'Shift and turn the combinations of the statement as we may, the problem of the future of America is, in certain respects, as dark as it is vast. Pride, competition, segregation, vicious willfulness, and license beyond example, brood already upon us. Unwieldy and immense, who shall hold in behemoth, who bridle leviathan? Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and over the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful, threatening gloom. It is useless to deny it: Democracy grows rankly up the thickest, noxious, deadliest plants and fruits of all\u2014brings worse and worse invaders\u2014needs newer, larger, stronger, keener compensations and compellers.'</p><p><strong>A Review from the Close.</strong></p><p>'November Boughs' begins with a review of the poet's career, and works from the standpoint of the journey's close: 'A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads.' There is humility and modesty in its tone, as well as hopefulness, assertion and a brave, serene confidence. Characterizing his poems, he thus prescribes his purpose and his method:</p><p>The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last is the word suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything, and could not consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought, there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus word is comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledged sense than hitherto. Other word signs would be good cheer, content and hope. The chief trait of any given poet is always the spirit he brings to the observation of humanity and nature, the mood out of which he contemplates his subjects. [illegible] Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals at all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that 'heroic nudity' on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editors of Leaves of Grass in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm these lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of 30 years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p><p>He continued with the following reverent words:</p><p>Then still a purpose inclosing all, and over and beneath all. Ever since what might be called thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance ('to justify the ways of God to man' is Milton's well known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones: to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only considered from the point of view of all, but of each. While I cannot understand it or argue it out, I fully believe in a clew and purpose in nature, entire and several; and that invisible spiritual results, just as real and definite as the visible, eventuate all concrete life and all materialism, through time. My book ought to emanate buoyance and gladness legitimately enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.</p><p>He ends with the words:</p><p>In the free evening of my day, I give to you, reader, the foregoing garrulous talk, thoughts, reminiscences,</p><p>As idly drifting down the ebb,<br>Such ripples, half-caught voices echo from the shore.</p><p>Concluding with two items for the imaginative genius of the West when it worthily rises\u2014First, what Herder taught to the young Goethe, that really great poetry is always (like the Homeric or Biblical canticles) the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polished and select few. Second, that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.</p><p><strong>The Latest Poems</strong></p><p>The latest poems, given under the title of 'Sands at Seventy' are like the voice of an old friend whose tones we have learned to love for the sake of the words they have conveyed, the thoughts they have clothed. So ever after, whatever the words be, the tones have a welcome sound. It is so with all old poets; their message has been spoken, their great harvest has been gathered, but the aftermath is to be valued, and scant though it may be, it still contains the quality, the savor of the rich soil that has rejoiced us with its abundant yield. These latest poems of Whitman's are fragmentary utterances; they have the old character of form and expression, but are intermittent flashes; detached images, brief glimpses. As with Dr. Holmes, these songs are pervaded by the reminiscent atmosphere of sunset hours. In one of the traits that have strongly characterized Whitman there is no perceptible decline\u2014that of graphic, terse and vivid delineation with a word or phrase that both depicts and suggests, like the sure brush stroke of a master painter. An example of this is to be found in the stately beginning on the poem of the death of Gen. Grant: 'As one by one withdraw the mighty actors,' striking at once the keynote of a majestic theme that is sustained with the same power to the close:</p><p>Thou from the prairies!\u2014tangled and many- <br>veined and hard has been thy part,<br>To admiration has it been enacted?</p><p>It is a glorious calm that pervades these four lines:</p><p>After the dazzle of day is gone,<br>Only the dark, dark night shows to my eyes the stars;<br>After the clangor of organ majestic, or chorus, <br>or perfect band,<br>Silent, athwart my soul, moves the symphony <br>true.</p><p>And, in these lines called 'Halcyon Days' the re [sic] is manifest what was once said of Appollonius of Tyana, that old age, as well as youth, has its bloom:</p><p>Not from successful love alone,<br>Nor wealth, nor honored middle age, nor vic-<br>tories of politics or war,<br>But as life wanes and all the turbulent pas-<br>sions calm,<br>As gorgeous, vapory, silent hues cover the <br>evening sky,<br>As softness, fullness, rest, suffuse the frame, <br>like fresher, balmier air,<br>As the days take on a mellower light, and the <br>apple at last hangs really finish'd and in-<br>dolent ripe on the tree,<br>Then for the teeming quietest, happiest days <br>of all!<br>The brooding and blissful halcyon days!</p><p>A strong group of poems are the 'Fancies at Navesink;' reflections on the meanings of the ocean rides as the pulse of the power that vivifies all\u2014the 'fluid, vast identity, holding the universe with all its parts as one.' Then the ebb, with its images of death, failure and despair swept on to oblivion\u2014but that not the end, for</p><p>Duly by you, from you, the tide and the <br>light again\u2014duly the hinges turning.<br>Duly the needed discord parts offsetting, <br>blending,<br>Weaving from you, from Sleep, Night, Death <br>itself.<br>The rhythms of birth eternal.</p><p>The six-line poem on Whittier's 80th birthday is a beautiful tribute. Those fond of drawing analogies might find much satisfaction in the resemblance in the names of the two poets, one a Hicksite Quaker, the other the son of Hicksite Quakers. Whitman passing his last years across the river from the great Quaker City, always using the quaint Quaker terminology of 'Fifth Month,' etc., and devoting the last pages of his 'November Boughs' to a collection of notes on Elias Hicks, of whom he says in his prefatory note:</p><p>As myself a little boy hearing so much of E. H., at that time long ago in Suffolk and Queens and Kings counties\u2014and more than once personally seeing the old man\u2014and my dear, dear father and mother faithful listeners to him at the meetings\u2014I remember how I dreamed to write, perhaps, a piece about E. H. and his look and discourses however long afterward\u2014for my parents' sake\u2014and the dear Friends, too! And the following is what has at last but all come out of it\u2014the feeling and intention never forgotten yet!</p><p><strong>Whitman's opinion of Tennyson</strong></p><p>is of particular interest, since the British laureate is one of our great American's most intimate, though never beheld, friends across the Atlantic. In the brief paper, 'A Word About Tennyson,' Whitman says:</p><p>Let me assume to pass verdict, or, perhaps, momentary judgment, for the United States on this poet\u2014a removed and distant position giving some advantages over a nigh one. What is Tennyson's service to his race, times, and especially to America? First, I should say\u2014or, at least, not forget\u2014his personal character. He is not to be mentioned as a rugged, evolutionary, aboriginal force\u2014but (and a great lesson is in it) he has been consistent throughout with the native, healthy patriotic spinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and conventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflects the upper crust of his time, its pale cast of thought\u2014even its ennui. Then the simile of my friend, John Burroughs, is entirely true. 'His glove is a glove of silk, but the hand is a hand of iron.' He shows how one can be a royal laureate, quite eloquent and 'aristocratic,' and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his non-democracy, it fits him well, and I like him the better for it. I guess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those sides of a thought or a possibility, different from our own\u2014different, and yet with a sort of home-likeness\u2014a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from taste and proclivities not at all his own\u2026Yes, Alfred Tennyson is a superb character, and will help give illustriousness, through the long roll of time, to our 19th century. In its bunch of orbic names, shining like a constellation of stars, his will be one of the brightest. His very faults, doubts, swervings, doublings upon himself, have been typical of our age. We are like the voyagers of a ship casting off for new seas, distant shores. We would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts, remembering and magnifying their pleasant experiences only, and more than once impelled to jump ashore before it is too late, and stay where our fathers stayed and live as they lived. May-be I am non-literary and non-decorous (let me at least be human and pay part of my debt) in this word about Tennyson. I want him to realize that here is a great and ardent nation that absorbs his songs, and has a respect and affection for him personally as almost for no other foreigner. I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as conveying no more than the simple truth: and that truth (a little Christmas gift) no slight one, either.</p><p>There are many other words worth reading in this new section of the volume; papers on Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Fr. Taylor, remarks on 'The Spanish Element in Our Nationality,' and various random notes and reminiscences, including some additional ones about the war. It is all pervaded by the healthy personal feeling, lofty patriotism and deep spirituality inherent in Whitman. Altogether, this complete edition may be called monumental in our literature.</p>", "date": "January 3 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "Sylvester Baxter", "publication": "The Boston Herald", "citation": "Baxter, Sylvester [unsigned in original]. \"Whitman's Complete Works.\" 3 January 1889.

For a moment one wonderingly inquires after the cause of this seeming neglect. The New World, with its new presentations to the senses, its new ideas and passions, its new social tendencies and habits, must surely, one thinks, have given birth to literary and artistic forms corresponding to itself in strange novelty, unlike in a remarkable degree those sprung from our Old-world, and old-world hearts. A moral soil and a moral climate so different from those of Europe must surely have produced a fauna and flora other than the European, a fauna and flora which the writers of literary natural history cannot but be curious to classify, and the peculiarities of which they must endeavour to account for by the special conditions of existence and of the development of species in the new country. It is as much to be expected that poems and pictures requiring new names should be found there as that new living things of any other kind, the hickory and the hemlock, the mocking bird and the katydid, should be found. So one reasons for a moment, and wonders. The fact is, that while the physical conditions, fostering certain forms of life, and repressing others, operated without let or hindrance, and disclosed themselves in their proper results with the simplicity and sureness of nature, the permanent moral powers were met by others of transitory or local, but, for the time, superior authority, which put a hedge around the literature and art of America, enclosing a little paradise of European culture, refinement, and aristocratic delicatesse from the howling wilderness of Yankee democracy, and insulating it from the vital touch and breath of the land, the winds of free, untrodden places, the splendour and vastness of rivers and seas, the strength and tumult of the people. Until of late indigenous growths of the New World showed in American literature like exotics, shy or insolent. We were aware of this, and expected in an American poet some one who would sing for us gently, in a minor key, the pleasant airs we knew. Longfellow's was a sweet and characteristic note, but, except in a heightened enjoyment of the antique\u2014a ruined Rhine castle, a goblet from which dead knights had drunk, a suit of armour, or anything frankly medieval\u2014except in this, Longfellow is one of ourselves\u2014an European. 'Evangeline' is an European idyl of American life, Hermann and Dorothea having emigrated to Acadie. 'Hiawatha' might have been dreamed in Kensington by a London man of letters who possessed a graceful idealizing turn of imagination, and who had studied with clear-minded and gracious sympathy the better side of Indian character and manners. Longfellow could amiably quiz, from a point of view of superior and contented refinement, his countrymen who went about blatant and blustering for a national art and literature which should correspond with the large proportions and freedom of the Republic. 'We want,' cries Mr. Hathaway in 'Kavanagh', 'a national drama, in which scope enough shall be given to our gigantic ideas, and to the unparalleled activity and progress of our people\u2026. We want a national literature, altogether shaggy and unshorn, that shall shake the earth, like a herd of buffaloes, thundering over the prairies!' And Mr. Churchill explains that what is best in literature is not national but universal, and is the fruit of refinement and culture. Longfellow's fellow-countryman, Irving, might have walked arm-in- arm with Addison, and Addison would have run no risk of being discomposed by a trans-Atlantic twang in his companion's accent. Irving, if he betrays his origin at all, betrays it somewhat in the same way as Longfellow, by his tender, satisfied repose in the venerable, chiefly the venerable in English society and manners, by his quiet delight in the implicit tradition of English civility, the scarcely-felt yet everywhere influential presence of a beautiful and grave Past, and the company of unseen beneficent associations. In Bryant, Europe is more in the background; prairie and immemorial forest occupy the broad spaces of his canvas, but he feels pleasure in these mainly because he is not native to their influences. The mountains are not his sponsors; there are not the unconsciousnesses between him and them which indicate kinship, nor the silences which prove entire communion. Moreover, the life of American men and women is almost absolutely unrepresented in the poetry of Bryant. The idealized red man is made use of as picturesque, an interesting and romantic person; but the Yankee is prosaic as his ledger. The American people had evidently not become an object of imaginative interest to itself in the mind of Bryant.</p><p>That the historical school of criticism should not have occupied itself with American literature is then hardly to be wondered at. A chapter upon that literature until recently must have been not a criticism but a prophecy. It was this very fact, the absence of a national literature, which the historical school was called on to explain. And to explain it evident and sufficient causes were producible, and were produced. The strictly Puritan origin of the Americans, the effort imposed upon them of subduing the physical forces of the country, and of yoking them to the service of man, the occupation of the entire community with an absorbing industry, the proximity of Europe, which made it possible for America to neglect the pursuit of the sciences, literature, and the fine arts without relapsing into barbarism\u2014these causes were enumerated by De Tocqueville as having concurred to fix the minds of the Americans upon purely practical objects. 'I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World; whilst the rest of the nation enjoying more leisure, and less harassed by the drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought, and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind.' Besides which, before a nation can become poetical to itself, consciously or unconsciously, it must possess a distinctive character, and the growth of national as of individual character is a process of long duration in every case, of longer duration than ordinary when a larger than ordinary variety of the elements of character wait to be assimilated and brought into harmony.</p><p>In Emerson a genuine product of the soil was perhaps for the first time apparent to us. We tasted in him the flavour of strange sap, and knew the ripening of another sun and other winds. He spoke of what is old and universal, but he spoke in the fashion of a modern man, and of his own nation. His Greek head pivoted restlessly on true Yankee shoulders, and when he talked Plato he did so in a dialectical variety of Attic peculiar to Boston. Lowell, at times altogether feudal and European, has also at times a trans-Atlantic air, in the earnest but somewhat vague spiritualism of his earlier poems, his enthusiasm about certain dear and dim general ideas, and more happily in a conception of the democratic type of manhood which appears in some of the poems of later years, especially in that very noble 'Ode recited at the Harvard Commemoration, July 21, 1865.' But taken as a whole, the works of Lowell do not mirror the life, the thoughts, and passions of the nation. They are works, as it were, of an English poet who has become a naturalized citizen of the United States, who admires the institutions, and has faith in the ideas of America, but who cannot throw off his allegiance to the old country, and its authorities.</p><p>At last steps forward a man unlike any of his predecessors, and announces himself, and is announced with a flourish of critical trumpets, as Bard of America, and Bard of democracy. What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-world clay, not cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timidly from behind his works to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am a solid and not an inconsiderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications. He attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love; or, our extreme repugnance. He does anything except leave us indifferent. However we feel towards him we cannot despise him. He is 'a summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be got rid of. Passed by he cannot be. To English readers Whitman is already known through Mr. Conway's personal reminiscences, published in the 'Fortnightly Review', through the judicious criticism of Mr. Rossetti prefixed to his volume of selections, and through other reviews, favourable and unfavourable. His critics have, for the most part, confined their attention to the personality of the man; they have studied him, for the most part, as a phenomenon isolated from the surrounding society, the environment, the milieu, which has made such a phenomenon possible. In a general way it has been said that Whitman is the representative in art of American democracy, but the meaning of this has not been investigated in detail. It is purposed here to consider some of the characteristics of democratic art, and to inquire in what manner they manifest themselves in Whitman's work.</p><p>A word of explanation is necessary. The representative man of a nation is not always the nation's favourite. Hebrew spiritualism, the deepest instincts, the highest reaches of the moral attainment of the Jewish race, appear in the cryings and communings of its prophets; yet the prophets sometimes cried in the wilderness, and the people went after strange gods. American democracy is as yet but half-formed. The framework of its institutions exists, but the will, the conscience, the mature desires of the democratic society are still in process of formation. If Whitman's writings are spoken of as the poetry of American democracy, it is not implied that his are the volumes most inquired after in the libraries of New York or Boston. What one means is that these are the poems which naturally arise when a man of imaginative genius stands face to face with a great democratic world, as yet but half-fashioned, such as society is in the United States of the present day. Successive editions of his works prove that Whitman has many readers. But whether he had them now, or waited for them in years to come, it would remain true that he is the first representative democrat in art of the American Continent. At the same time he is before all else a living man, and must not be compelled to appear as mere official representative of anything. He will not be comprehended in a formula. No view of him can image the substance, the life and movement of his manhood, which contracts and dilates, and is all over sensitive and vital. Such views are, however, valuable in the study of literature, as hypotheses are in the natural sciences, at least for the collocation of facts. They have a tendency to render criticism rigid and doctrinaire; the critic must therefore ever be ready to escape from his own theory of a man, and come in contact with the man himself. Every one doubtless moves in some regular orbit, and all aberrations are only apparent, but what the precise orbit is we must be slow to pronounce. Meanwhile we may legitimately conjecture, as Kepler conjectured, if only we remain ready as Kepler was to vary our conjectures as the exigencies of the observed phenomena require.</p><p>A glance at the art of an aristocratic period will inform us in the way of contrast of much that we may expect to find under a democracy. And before all else we are impressed by the great regard which the artists of an aristocratic period pay to form. The dignity of letters maintains itself, like the dignity of the court, by a regulated propriety of manners. Ideas and feelings cannot be received unless they wear the courtly costume. Precise canons applicable to the drama, the ode, the epic, to painting, sculpture, architecture, music, are agreed upon, and are strictly enforced. They acquire traditional authority, the precedents of a great period of art (such, for example, as that of Louis XIV.) being final and absolute with succeeding generations. 'Style is deemed of almost as much importance as thought\u2026.The tone of mind is always dignified, seldom very animated, and writers care more to perfect what they produce than to multiply their productions.' The peril to which an aristocratic literature is hereby exposed is of a singular kind; matter or substance may cease to exist, while an empty and elaborately studied form, a variegated surface with nothing below it, may remain. This condition of things was actually realized at different times in the literatures of Italy, of Spain, of France, and of England, when such a variegated surface of literature served for disport and display of the wits of courtiers, of ingenious authors, of noble and gentle persons male and female, and when reflection and imagination had ceased to have any relation with letters.</p><p>Again, the literature of an aristocracy is distinguished by its striving after selectness, by its exclusive spirit, and the number of things it proscribes. This is especially the case with the courtly art which has a great monarchy for its centre of inspiration. There is an ever-present terror of vulgarity. Certain words are ineligible in poetry; they are mean or undignified, and the things denoted by them must be described in an elegant periphrasis. Directness and vividness are sacrificed to propriety. The acquired associations of words are felt to be as important, and claim as much attention as their immediate significance, their spiritual power and personal character. In language as in life there is, so to speak, an aristocracy and a commonalty; words with a heritage of dignity, words which have been ennobled, and a rabble of words which are excluded from positions of honour and of trust. But this striving after selectness in forms of speech is the least important manifestation of the exclusive spirit of aristocratic art. Far the greater number of men and women, classes of society, conditions of life, modes of thought and feeling, are not even conceived as in any way susceptible of representation in art which aspires to be grave and beautiful. The common people do not show themselves en masse except as they may follow in a patient herd, or oppose in impotent and insolent revolt the leadership of their lords. Individually they are never objects of equal interest with persons of elevated worldly station. Even Shakespeare could hardly find in humble life other virtues than a humorous honesty and an affectionate fidelity. Robin Hood, the popular hero, could not be quite heroic were he not of noble extraction, and reputed Earl of Huntingdon. In the decline of an aristocratic period, dramatic studies of individual character and the life of the peasant or artisan may be made from a superior point of view. The literature of benevolence and piety stooping down to view the sad bodies and souls of men tends in this direction. And there are poems and novels, and paintings and sculptures, which flatter the feeling of mild benevolence. Pictures like those of Faed, in which some aged cottager, some strong delver of the earth, or searcher of the sea, some hardworked father of children, says appealingly, 'By virtue of this love I exhibit towards my offspring, by virtue of the correct sense I have of the condescension of my betters, by virtue of this bit of pathos\u2014indubitably human\u2014in my eye, confess now am I not a man and a brother?'\u2014pictures like these are produced, and may be purchased by amiable persons of the upper classes who would honour the admirable qualities which exist in humble life. But when the aristocratic period is in its strength, and especially in courtly art and literature, these condescending studies, not without a certain affection and sincerity in them, are unknown. It is as if the world were made up of none but the gently born and bred. At most rustic life is glanced at for the sake of the suggestions of pretty waywardness it may supply to the fancy of great people tired of greatness. To play at pastoral may be for a while the fashion, if the shepherds and shepherdesses are permitted to choose graceful classical names, if the crooks are dainty, and the duties of the penfold not severe, if Phillis may set off a neat ankle with the latest shoe, and Corydon may complain of the cruel fair in the bitterness of roundel or sonnet. The middle classes, however, the bourgeoisie, figure considerably in one department of poetry\u2014in the comic drama. Moliere indeed, living under a stricter rule of courtliness, suffered disgrace in consequence of the introduction of so low-bred a person as the excellent M. Jourdain. But to the noble mind of our own Caroline period how rich a material of humour, inexhaustibly diverting, if somewhat monotonous in theme, was afforded by the relations of the high-born and the moneyed classes. The bourgeois aping the courtier, the lord making a fool of the merchant, while he makes love to the merchant's wife and daughter\u2014what unextinguishable laughter have variations upon these elementary themes compelled from the occupants of the boxes in our Restoration theatres! There is an innocence quite touching in their openness to impressions from the same comic effects repeated again and again. Harlequin still at the close of the pantomime belabouring Pantaloon is not more sure of his success with the wide-eyed on-lookers in the front row than was the gallant engaged in seducing the draper's or hosier's pretty wife with gold supplied by her husband, in the playhouses favoured by our mirthful monarch and his companions.</p><p>All that is noblest in an aristocratic age embodies itself not in its comedy, but its serious art, and in the persons of heroic men and women. Very high and admirable types of character are realized in the creation of epic and dramatic poetry. All the virtues which a position of hereditary greatness, dignity, and peril calls forth\u2014energy of character, vigour of will, disregard of life, of limb, and of property in comparison with honour, the virtues of generosity, loyalty, courtesy, magnificence\u2014these are glorified and illustrated in man; and in woman all the virtues of dependence, all the graces insensibly acquired upon the surface of an externally beautiful world, and at times the rarer qualities called forth by occasional exigencies of her position, which demand virtues of the masculine kind. It is characteristic and right that our chief chivalric epic, the Faerie Queene, should set before itself as the general end of all the book 'to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline.' The feudal world with Artegall and Calidore, with Britomart and Una, was not wanting in lofty conceptions of human character, male and female.</p><p>Other characteristics of the art of an aristocratic period may be briefly noted. It is not deeply interested in the future, it gazes forward with no eyes of desire. Why should it? when nothing seems better than that things should remain as they are, or at most that things should be ameliorated, not that a new world should be created. The aristocratic society exists by inheritance, and it hopes from to-morrow chiefly a conserving of the good gifts handed down by yesterday and to-day. Its feeling of the continuity of history is in danger of becoming formal and materialistic; it does not always perceive that the abandonment of old things and the acceptance of new may be a necessary piece of continuity in government, in social life, in art, in religion. At the present the artist of the period of aristocracy looks not very often, and then askance upon certain approved parts of the Present. But he loves to celebrate the glories of the Past. He displays a preference accordingly for antique subjects, chosen out of the history of his own land, or the histories of deceased nations. Shelley with his eyes fixed upon the golden age to come may stand as representative of the democratic tendencies in art; Scott, celebrat-ing the glories of feudalism, its heroism and its refinements, will remain our great aristocratic artist of the period subsequent to the first French Revolution. The relation of the art to the religion of an age of aristocracy is peculiarly simple. The religious dogma which constitutes the foundation and formative principle of the existing society must have been fully established, and of supreme power, before the aristocratic form of social and political life can have acquired vigour and stability; the intellectual and moral habits favoured by the aristocratic polity\u2014loyalty, obedience, veneration for authority, pride in the past, a willingness to accept things as they come to us from our fathers, a distrust of new things, all favour a permanence of belief. The art, therefore, will upon the whole (peculiar circumstances may of course produce remarkable exceptions) be little disturbed by the critical or sceptical spirit, and, untroubled by doubts, that art will either concern itself not at all with religion, or, accepting the religious dogma without dispute, will render it into artistic form in sublime allegory and symbol, and as it is found embodied in the venerable history of the Church. We may finally note from De Tocqueville the shrinking in an aristocratic society from whatever, even in pleasure, is too startling, violent, or acute, and the especial approval of choice gratifications, of refined and delicate enjoyments.</p><p>Now in all these particulars the art of a democratic age exhibits characteristics precisely opposite to those of the art of an aristocracy. Form and style modelled on traditional examples are little valued. No canons of composition are agreed upon or observed without formal agreement. No critical dictator enacts laws which are accepted without dispute, and acquire additional authority during many years. Each new generation, with its new heave of life, its multitudinous energies, ideas, passions, is a law to itself. Except public opinion, there is no authority on earth above the authority of a man's own soul, and public opinion being strongly in favour of individualism, a writer is tempted to depreciate unduly the worth of order, propriety, regularity of the academic kind; he is encouraged to make new literary experiments as others make new experiments in religion; he is permitted to be true to his own instincts, whether they are beautiful instincts or the reverse. The appeal which a work of art makes is to the nation, not to a class, and diversities of style are consequently admissible. Every style can be tolerated except the vapid, everything can be accepted but that which fails to stimulate the intellect or the passions.</p><p>Turning to Whitman, we perceive at once that his work corresponds with this state of things. If he had written in England in the period of Queen Anne, if he had written in France in the period of the grand monarque, he must have either acknowledged the supremacy of authority in literature and submitted to it, or on the other hand revolted against it. As it is, he is remote from authority, and neither submits nor revolts. Whether we call what he has written verse or prose, we have no hesitation in saying that it is no copy, that it is something uncontrolled by any model or canon, something which takes whatever shape it possesses directly from the soul of its maker. With the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare familiar to him, Whitman writes in the presence of great models, and some influences from each have doubtless entered into his nature; but that they should possess authority over him any more than that he should possess authority over them, does not occur to him as possible. The relation of democracy to the Past comes out very notably here. Entirely assured of its own right to the Present, it is prepared to acknowledge fully the right of past generations to the Past. It is not hostile to that Past, rather claims kinship with it, but also claims equality, as a full-grown son with a father:\u2014</p><p>'I conn'd old times;<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters <br>might return and study me!<br>In the name of These States, shall I scorn the <br>antique?<br>Why These are the children of the antique, to <br>justify it.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophs, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long <br>since,<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, with- drawn or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit <br>what you have left, wafted hither:<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable (moving <br>awhile among it);<br>Think nothing can ever be greater,\u2014nothing <br>can ever deserve more than it deserves;<br>Regarding it all intently a long while,\u2014then <br>dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.'</p><p>It is the same thought which finds expression in the following enumeration of the benefactors of the soul of man in Whitman's prose essay Democratic Vistas; after which enumeration, they are dismissed, and a summons is sent forth for the appearance of their modern successors:\u2014</p><p>'For us along the great highways of time, those monuments stand\u2014those forms of majesty and beauty. For us those beacons burn through all the nights. Unknown Egyptians, graving hieroglyphs; Hindus with hymn and apothegm and endless epic; Hebrew prophet, with spirituality, as in flashes of lightning, conscience, like red-hot iron, plaintive songs and screams of vengeance for tyrannies and enslavement; Christ, with bent head, brooding love and peace, like a dove; Greek, creating eternal shapes of physical and esthetic proportion; Roman, lord of satire, the sword, and the codex;\u2014of the figures some far-off and veiled, others nearer and visible; Dante, stalking with lean form, nothing but fibre, not a grain of superfluous flesh; Angelo, and the great painters, architects, musicians; rich Shakespeare, luxuriant as the sun, artist and singer of Feudalism in its sunset, with all the gorgeous colours, owner thereof, and using them at will; and so to such as German Kant and Hegel, where they, though near us, leaping over the ages, sit again impassive, imperturbable, like the Egyptian gods. Of these, and the like of these, is it too much, indeed, to return to our favourite figure, and view them as orbs and systems of orbs, moving in free paths in the spaces of that other heaven, the kosmic intellect, the Soul?</p><p>'Ye powerful and resplendent ones! ye were in your atmospheres, grown not for America, but rather for her foes, the Feudal and the old\u2014while our genius is Democratic and modern. Yet could ye, indeed, but breathe your breath of life into our New World's nostrils\u2014not to enslave us, as now, but for our needs, to breed a spirit like your own\u2014perhaps (dare we to say it?) to dominate, even destroy, what you yourselves have left! On your plane, and no less, but even higher and wider, will I mete and measure for our wants to-day and here. I demand races of orbic bards, with unconditional, uncompromising sway. Come forth, sweet democratic despots of the west!'</p><p>As in all else, so with regard to the form of what he writes, Walt Whitman can find no authority superior to himself, or rather to the rights of the subject which engages him. There is, as Mr. Rossetti has observed, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense,' throughout his writings, prose and verse (if we consent to apply the term verse to any of them), and this rhythmical sense, as with every great poet, is original and inborn. His works, it may be, exhibit no perfect crystal of artistic form, but each is a menstruum saturated with form in solution. He fears to lose the instinctive in any process of elaboration, the vital in anything which looks like mechanism. He does not write with a full consciousness of the processes of creation, nor does any true poet. Certain combinations of sound are preconceived, and his imagination excited by them works towards them by a kind of reflex action, automatically. His ars poetica is embodied in the precept that the poet should hold himself passive in presence of the material universe, in presence of society, in presence of his own soul, and become the blind but yet unerringly guided force through which these seek artistic expression. No afterthought, no intrusion of reasoning, no calculating of effects, no stepping back to view his work is tolerated. The artist must create his art with as little hesitation, as little questioning of processes, and as much sureness of result as the beaver builds his house. Very nobly Whitman has spoken on this subject, and let those who, because they do not know him, suppose him insensible to any attractions in art except those of the extravagant, the incoherent, and the lawless, read what follows from the preface to 'Leaves of Grass':\u2014</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression, and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity\u2014nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse, and pierce intellectual depths, and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods, and grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have looked on him who has achieved it, you have looked on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey-gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art\u2026. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt, or startle, or fascinate, or soothe, I will have purposes as health, or heat, or snow has, and be as regardless of observation.'</p><p>Seeing much of deep truth in this, it must be added that, when the poet broods over his half-formed creation, and fashions it with divine ingenuity, and gives it shapeliness and completion of detail, and the lustre of finished workmanship, he does not forsake his instincts, but is obedient to them; he does not remove from nature into a laboratory of art, but is the close companion of nature. The vital spontaneous movement of the faculties, far from ceasing, still goes on like 'the flight of the grey-gull over the bay,' while the poet seeks after order, proportion, comeliness, melody\u2014in a word beauty; or rather, as Whitman himself is fond of saying, does not seek but is sought\u2014the perfect form preconceived but unattained, drawing the artist toward itself with an invincible attraction. An artist who does not yield to the desire for perfect order and beauty of form, instead of coming closer to nature is really forsaking nature, and doing violence to a genuine artistic instinct. Walt Whitman, however, knows this in all probability well enough, and does not need to be taught the mysteries of his craft. We will not say that his poems, as regards their form, do not, after all, come right, or that for the matter which he handles his manner of treatment may not be the best possible. One feels, as it has been well said, that although no counting of syllables will reveal the mechanism of the music, the music is there, and that 'one would not for something change ears with those who cannot hear it.' Whitman himself anticipates a new theory of literary composition for imaginative works, and especially for highest poetry, and desires the recognition of new forces in language, and the creation of a new manner of speech which cares less for what it actually realizes in definite form than 'for impetus and effects, and for what it plants and invigorates to grow.' Nevertheless, when we read not the lyrical portions of Whitman's poetry, but what may be called his poetical statements of thoughts and things, a suspicion arises that if the form be suitable here to the matter, it must be because the matter belongs rather to the chaos than the kosmos of the new-created world of art.</p><p>The principle of equality upon which the democratic form of society is founded, obviously opposes itself to the exclusive spirit of the aristocratical polity. The essential thing which gives one the freedom of the world is not to be born a man of this or that rank, or class, or caste, but simply to be born a man. The literature of an aristocratic period is distinguished by its aim at selectness, and the number of things it proscribes; we should expect the literature of a democracy to be remarkable for its comprehensiveness, its acceptance of the persons of all men, its multiform sympathies. The difference between the President and the Broadway mason or hodman is inconsiderable\u2014an accident of office; what is common to both is the inexpressibly important thing, their inalienable humanity. Rich and poor, high and low, powerful and feeble, healthy and diseased, deformed and beautiful, old and young, man and woman, have this in common, and by possession of this are in the one essential thing equal, and brethren one of another. Even between the virtuous man and the vicious the difference is less than the agreement; they differ by a quality, but agree by the substance of their manhood. The man in all men, however it may be obscured by cruel shocks and wrenches of life which distort, by long unnatural uses which deform, by ignorance, by the well-meaning stupidity of others, or by one's own stupidity, by foul living, or by clean, hard, worldly living, is surely somewhere discoverable. How can any human creature be rejected, any scorned, any mocked? Such satire and such comedy as appear in aristocratic society are discouraged by the genius of democracy. The spirit of exclusiveness will, it is true, never fail to find material for its support, and baser prizes may replace the calm, conservative, but unaggressive pride of hereditary dignity. Nevertheless it remains no less true that the spectacle of a great democracy present to the imagination, and the temper of the democracy accepted by the understanding heart, favour only such prides as are founded on nature\u2014that is, on the possession, acquired or inherited, of personal qualities, personal powers, and virtues, and attainments.</p><p>If this be a true account of some characteristics of the art which rises when a man of imaginative genius stands face to face with a great democracy, Walt Whitman in these particulars is what he claims to be, a representative democrat in art. No human being is rejected by him, no one slighted, nor would he judge any, except as 'the light falling around a helpless thing' judges. No one in his poems comes appealing 'Am I not interesting, am I not deserving, am I not a man and a brother?' We have had, he thinks, 'ducking and deprecating about enough.' The poet studies no one from a superior point of view. He delights in men, and neither approaches deferentially those who are above him, nor condescendingly gazes upon those who are beneath. He is the comrade of every man, high and low. His admiration of a strong, healthy, and beautiful body, or a strong, healthy, and beautiful soul, is great when he sees it in a statesman or a savant; it is precisely as great when he sees it in the ploughman or the smith. Every variety of race and nation, every condition in society, every degree of culture, every season of human life, is accepted by Whitman as admirable and best, each in its own place. Working men of every name\u2014all who engage in fieldwork, all who toil upon the sea, the city artisan, the woodsman and the trapper, fill him with pleasure by their presence; and that they are interesting to him not in a general way of theory or doctrine (a piece of the abstract democratic creed), but in the way of close, vital human sympathy appears from the power he possesses of bringing before us with strange precision, vividness, and nearness in a few decisive strokes the essential characteristics of their respective modes of living. If the strong, full-grown working man wants a lover and comrade, he will think Walt Whitman especially made for him. If the young man wants one, he will think him especially the poet of young men. Yet a rarer and finer spell than that of the lusty vitality of youth, or the trained activity of manhood, is exercised over the poet by the beautiful repose or unsubdued energy of old age. He is 'the caresser of life, wherever moving.' He does not search antiquity for heroic men and beautiful women; his own abundant vitality makes all the life which surrounds him a source of completest joy; 'what is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me\u2026.not asking the sky to come down to my good-will; scattering it freely for ever.' Let a few passages illustrate Whitman's joyous sympathy with men:\u2014</p><p>'I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like <br>is enough,<br>To stop in company with the rest at evening <br>is enough,<br>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breath-<br>ing, laughing flesh is enough,<br>To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest <br>my arm ever so lightly round his or her <br>neck for a moment\u2014what is this, then?<br>I do not ask any more delight. I swim in it, <br>as in a sea.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>'The big doors of the country barn stand open <br>and ready;<br>The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the <br>slow-drawn wagon;<br>The clear light plays on the brown grey and <br>green intertinged;<br>The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.<br>I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the <br>load;<br>I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the <br>other;<br>I jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clo-<br>ver and timothy,<br>And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair <br>full of wisps.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>'The negro holds firmly the reins of his four<br> horses, the block swags underneath on its <br>tied-over chain;<br>The negro that drives the dray of the stone-<br> yard, steady and tall he stands, pois'd on <br>one leg on the string-piece;<br>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and <br>breast, and loosens over his hip-band;<br>His glance is tall and commanding, he tosses <br>the slouch of his hat away from his fore- <br>head;<br>The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache, <br>falls on the black of his polished and per-<br>fect limbs.<br>I behold the picturesque giant, and love him.'</p><p>The following loses much by being removed from its place at the end of the poem of 'Faces,' which it closes with calm melodious chords:\u2014</p><p>'The old face of the mother of many children!<br>Whist! I am fully content.<br>Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day <br>morning,<br>It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fen-<br>ces,<br>It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry, <br>and the cat-brier under them.<br>I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,<br>I heard what the singers were singing so long,<br>Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the <br>white froth and the water-blue.<br>Behold a woman!<br>She looks out from her quaker-cap\u2014her face is <br>clearer and more beautiful than the sky.<br>She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded <br>porch of the farmhouse,<br>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen;<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-<br>daughters spun it with the distaff and the <br>wheel.<br>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go,<br> and does not wish to go,<br>The justified mother of men.'</p><p>But it is not those alone who are beautiful and healthy and good who claim the poet's love. To all 'the others are down on' Whitman's hand is outstretched to help, and through him come to us the voices\u2014petitions or demands\u2014of the diseased and despairing, of slaves, of prostitutes, of thieves, of deformed persons, of drunkards. Every man is a divine miracle to him, and he sees a redeemer, whom Christ will not be ashamed to acknowledge a comrade, in every one who performs an act of loving self-sacrifice:\u2014</p><p>'Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row, <br>from three lusty angels with shirts bagged <br>out at their waists;<br>The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeem-<br>ing sins past and to come,<br>Selling all he possesses, travelling on foot to<br> fee lawyers for his brother, and sit by him <br>while he is tried for forgery.'</p><p>Is there no limit to the poet's acceptance of the persons of men? There is one test of his tolerance more severe than can be offered by the vicious or the deformed. Can he tolerate the man of science? Yes, though he were to find him peeping and botanizing upon his mother's grave. Science and democracy appear before Whitman as twin powers which bend over the modern world hand in hand, great and beneficent. Democracy seems to him that form of society which alone is scientifically justifiable; founded upon a recognition of the facts of nature, and a resolute denial of social fables, superstitions, and uninvestigated tradition. Moreover he looks to science for important elements which shall contribute to a new conception of nature and of man, and of their mutual relations, to be itself the ideal basis of a new poetry and art\u2014'after the chemist, geologist, ethnologist, finally shall come the Poet worthy that name; the true Son of God shall come singing his songs.' Lastly, Whitman has a peculiar reason of his own for loving science; he is a mystic, and such a mystic as finds positive science not unacceptable. Whitman's mysticism is not of the Swedenborgian type. He beholds no visions of visible things in heaven or hell unseen to other men. He rather sees with extraordinary precision the realities of our earth, but he sees them, in his mystical mood, as symbols of the impalpable and spiritual. They are hieroglyphs most clear-cut, most brilliantly and definitely coloured to his eyes, but still expressive of something unseen. His own personality as far as he can give it expression or is conscious of it\u2014that identity of himself, which is the hardest of all facts, and the only entrance to all facts, is yet no more than the image projected by another ego, the real Me, which stands 'untouched, untold, altogether unreached:'\u2014</p><p>'Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-con-<br>gratulatory signs and bows,<br>With peals of ironical laughter at every word <br>I have written,</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>Now I perceive I have not understood anything <br>\u2014not a single object; and that no man ever <br>can.<br>I perceive Nature, here in sight of the sea, is <br>taking advantage of me, to dart upon me, and <br>sting me,<br>Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing<br> at all.'</p><p>To such mysticism science cannot succeed in opposing itself: it can but provide the mystic with a new leaf of the sacred writing in which spiritual truths are recorded. Note the pregnant parenthesis in the following:</p><p>'Gentlemen! [men of science] to you the first <br>honours always.<br>Your facts are useful and real, and yet they are <br>not my dwelling;<br>(I but enter by them into an area of my dwell-<br>ing.)'</p><p>If Whitman seems suspicious of any class of men, disposed to be antagonistic to any, it is to those whose lives are spent among books, who are not in contact with external nature, and the stir and movement of human activity, but who receive things already prepared, or, as Whitman expresses it, 'distilled.' He knows that the distillations are delightful, and would intoxicate himself also, but he will not let them. Rather he chooses to 'lean and loafe at his ease, observing a spear of summer grass,' to drink the open air (that is, everything natural and unelaborated); he is 'enamoured of growing outdoors.' At the same time his most ardent aspiration is after a new literature, accordant with scientific conceptions, and the feelings which correspond with democracy. And to the literature of the old world and of feudalism he willingly does justice. 'American students may well derive from all former lands\u2026. from witty and warlike France, and markedly, and in many ways, and at many different periods, from the enterprise and soul of the great Spanish race, bearing ourselves always courteous, always deferential, indebted beyond measure to the mother- world, to all its nations dead, as to all its nations living\u2014the offspring, this America of ours, the daughter not by any means of the British Isles exclusively, but of the Continent, and of all continents.' True culture and learning Whitman venerates; but he suspects men of refinement and polite letters and dainty information, the will-o'-the-wisps of Goethe's 'M\u00e4hrchen,' who 'lose themselves in countless masses of adjustments,' who end by becoming little better than 'supercilious infidels,' whose culture, as Carlyle long since observed, is of a 'sceptical-destructive' kind.</p><p>Men of every class then are interesting to Whitman. But no individual is pre-eminently interesting to him. His sketches of individual men and women, though wonderfully vivid and precise, are none of them longer than a page; each single figure passes rapidly out of sight, and a stream of other figures of men and women succeeds. Even in 'Lincoln's Burial Hymn' he has only a word to say of 'the large sweet soul that has gone;' the chords of his nocturn, with their implicated threefold sweetness, odour and sound and light, having passed into his strain, really speak not of Lincoln but of death. George Peabody is celebrated briefly, because through him, a 'stintless, lavish giver, tallying the gifts of earth,' a multitude of human beings have been blessed, and the true service of riches illustrated. No single person is the subject of Whitman's song, or can be; the individual suggests a group, and the group a multitude, each unit of which is as interesting as every other unit, and possesses equal claims to recognition. Hence the recurring tendency of his poems to become catalogues of persons and things. Selection seems forbidden to him; if he names one race of mankind the names of all other races press into his page; if he mentions one trade or occupation, all other trades and occupations follow. A long procession of living forms passes before him; each several form, keenly inspected for a moment, is then dismissed. Men and women are seen en masse, and the mass is viewed not from a distance, but close at hand, where it is felt to be a concourse of individuals. Whitman will not have the people appear in his poems by representatives or delegates; the people itself, in its undiminished totality, marches through his poems, making its greatness and variety felt. Writing down the headings of a Trades' Directory is not poetry; but this is what Whitman never does. His catalogues are for the poet always, if not always for the reader, visions\u2014they are delighted\u2014not perhaps delightful\u2014enumerations; when his desire for the perception of greatness and variety is satisfied, not when a really complete catalogue is made out, Whitman's enumeration ends; we may murmur, but Whitman has been happy; what has failed to interest our imaginations has deeply interested his; and even for us the impression of multitude, of variety, of equality is produced, as perhaps it could be in no other way. Whether Whitman's habit of cataloguing be justified by what has been said, or is in any way justifiable, such at least is its true interpretation and significance.</p><p>One can perceive at a glance that these characteristics of Whitman's work proceed directly from the democratic tendencies of the world of thought and feeling in which he moves. It is curious to find De Tocqueville, before there existed properly any native American literature, describing in the spirit of philosophical prophecy what we find realized in Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass':\u2014</p><p>'He who inhabits a democratic country sees around him, on every hand, men differing but little from each other; he cannot turn his mind to any one portion of mankind without expanding and dilating his thought till it embraces the whole world\u2026. The poets of democratic ages can never take any man in particular as the subject of a piece, for an object of slender importance, which is distinctly seen on all sides, will never lend itself to an ideal conception\u2026. As all the citizens who compose a democratic community are nearly equal and alike, the poet cannot dwell upon any one of them; but the nation itself invites the exercise of his powers. The general similitude of individuals which renders any one of them, taken separately, an improper subject of poetry, allows poets to include them all in the same imagery, and to take a general survey of the people itself. Democratic nations have a clearer perception than any other of their own aspect; and an aspect so imposing is admirably fitted to the delineation of the ideal.'</p><p>The democratic poet celebrates no individual hero, nor does he celebrate himself. 'I celebrate myself,' sings Whitman, and the longest poem in 'Leaves of Grass' is named by his own name; but the self-celebration throughout is celebration of himself as a man and an American; it is what he possesses in common with all others that he feels to be glorious and worthy of song, not that which differentiates him from others; manhood, and in particular American manhood, is the real subject of the poem 'Walt Whitman;' and although Whitman has a most poignant feeling of personality, which indeed is a note of all he has written, it is to be remembered that in nearly every instance in which he speaks of himself the reference is as much impersonal as personal. In what is common he finds what is most precious. The true hero of the democratic poet is the nation of which he is a member, or the whole race of man to which the nation belongs. The mettlesome, proud, turbulent, brave, self-asserting young Achilles, lover of women and lover of comrades of Whitman's epic, can be no other than the American people; his Ulysses, the prudent, the 'cute, the battler with the forces of nature, the traveller in sea-like prairie, desolate swamp, and dense forest is brother Jonathan. But if the American nation is his hero, let it be observed that it is the American nation as the supposed leader of the human race, as the supposed possessor in ideas, in type of character, and in tendency if not in actual achievement, of all that is most powerful and promising for the progress of mankind.</p><p>To the future Whitman looks to justify his confidence in America and in democracy. The aspect of the present he finds both sad and encouraging. The framework of society exists; the material civilization is rich and fairly organized. Without any transcendentalism or political mysticism about the principle of universal suffrage, not glossing over its 'appalling dangers,' and for his own part content that until its time were come self-government should wait, and the condition of authoritative tutelage continue, he yet approves the principle as 'the only safe and preservative one for coming times,' and sees in America its guardian. He dwells with inexhaustible delight upon certain elements in the yet unformed personal character of the average American man and woman. And his experience, and the experience of the nation during the civil war\u2014proving the faithfulness, obedience, docility, courage, fortitude, religious nature, tenderness, sweet affection of countless numbers of the unnamed, unknown rank and file of North and South\u2014practically justifies democracy in Whitman's eyes 'beyond the proudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts.' But at the same time no one perceives more clearly, or observes with greater anxiety and alarm, the sore diseases of American society; and leaving us to reconcile his apparently contradictory statements, he does not hesitate to declare that the New World democracy, 'however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain highly de-ceptive superficial popular intellectuality, is so far an almost complete failure in its social aspects, in any superb general personal character, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, and \u2018sthetic results.' A vast and more and more thoroughly appointed body Whitman finds in the American world, and little or no soul. His senses are flattered, his imagination roused and delighted by the vast movement of life which surrounds him, its outward glory and gladness, but when he inquires, What is behind all this? the answer is of the saddest and most shameful kind. The following passage is in every way, in substance and in manner, highly characteristic of Whitman; but the reader must remember that in spite of all that he discerns of evil in democratic America, Whitman remains an American proud of his nationality, and a believer who does not waver in his democratic faith:\u2014</p><p>'After an absence, I am now (September, 1870) again in New York City and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bay, sparkling sea-tides, costly and lofty new buildings, the facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich shops, the wharves, the great Central Park, and the Brooklyn Park of Hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)\u2014the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trade, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters\u2014these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my senses of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my \u2018sthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the East and North rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilothouses, or pass an hour in Wall Street, or the gold exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom, and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas\u2014but in the artificial, the work of man too is equally great\u2014in this profusion of teeming humanity, in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships\u2014these seething, hurrying, feverish crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p><p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general effect; coming down to what is of the only real importance, Personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask, Are there, indeed, Men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women, to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Are there arts worthy Freedom, and a rich people? Is there a great moral and religious civilization\u2014the only justification of a great material one?</p><p>Confess that rather to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infidelity\u2014everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe\u2014everywhere an abnormal libidinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignoned, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (considering the advantages enjoyed) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p><p>Such a picture of the outcome of American democracy is ugly enough to satisfy the author of 'Shooting Niagara\u2014and after?' but such a picture only represents the worst side of the life of great cities. Whitman can behold these things, not without grief, not without shame, but without despair. He does not unfairly contrast the early years of confusion and crudity of a vast industrial and democratic era with the last and perfected results of an era of feudalism and aristocracy. He finds much to make him sad; but more to make him hopeful. He takes account of the evil anxiously, accurately; and can still rejoice. Upon the whole his spirit is exulting and prompt in cheerful action; not self-involved, dissatisfied, and fed by indignation. Contrast with the passage given above Whitman's preface to 'Leaves of Grass' prefixed to Mr. Rossetti's volume of Selections, with its joyous confidence and pride in American persons and things, or that very noble poem 'A Carol of Harvest, for 1867,' in which the armies of blue-clad conquering men are seen streaming North, and melt away and disappear, while in the same hour the heroes reappear, toiling in the fields, harvesting the products, glad and secure under the beaming sun, and under the great face of Her, the Mother, the Republic, without whom not a scythe might swing in security, 'not a maize-stalk dangle its silken tassels in peace.' If all enthusiasm about political principles be of the nature of Schw\u00e4rmerei, Whitman's feeling towards the Republic deserves that name; but he would have the principles of democracy sternly tested by results,\u2014results not only present but prospective and logically inevitable, and he has faith in them not because they seem to him to favour freedom any more than because they seem to favour law and self-control, and security, and order. He, as much as Mr. Carlyle, admires 'disciplined men,' and believes that with every disciplined man 'the arena of Anti-Anarchy, of God-appointed Order in this world' is widened; but he does not regard military service as the type of highest discipline, nor the drill-sergeant as highest conceivable official person in the land.</p><p>The principle of political and social equality once clearly conceived and taken to heart as true, works outward through one's body of thought and feeling in various directions. If in the polity of the nation every citizen be entitled by virtue of the fact of his humanity to make himself heard, to manifest his will, and in his place to be respected, then in the polity of the individual man, made up of the faculties of soul and body, every natural instinct, every passion, every appetite, every organ, every power, may claim its share in the government of the man. If a human being is to be honoured as such, then every part of a human being is to be honoured. In asserting one's rights as a man, one asserts the rights of everything which goes to make up manhood. It is the democratic temper to accept realities unless it is compelled to reject them; to disregard artificial distinctions, and refer all things to natural standards, consequently to honour things because they are natural and exist. Thus we find our way to the centre of what has been called the 'materialism' of Whitman\u2014his vindication of the body as it might be more correctly termed. Materialist, in any proper sense of the word, he is not; on the contrary, as Mr. Rossetti has stated, 'he is a most strenuous asserter of the soul,' but 'with the soul, of the body, as its infallible associate and vehicle in the present frame of things.' And as every faculty of the soul seems admirable and sacred to him, so does every organ and function and natural act of the body. But Whitman is a poet; it is not his manner to preach doctrines in an abstract form, by means of a general statement; and the doctrine, which seems to him of vital importance, that a healthy, perfect body\u2014male or female\u2014is altogether worthy of honour, admiration, and desire, is accordingly preached with fulness and plainness of detail. The head of his offending with many who read, and who refuse to read him, lies of course here. That lurking piece of asceticism, not yet cast out of most of us, which hints that there is something peculiarly shameful in the desire of the sexes for one another, of the man for the woman, and of the woman for the man, will certainly find matter enough of offence in one short section of 'Leaves of Grass', that entitled 'Children of Adam.' And one admission must be made to Whitman's disadvantage. If there be any class of subjects which it is more truly natural, more truly human not to speak of than to speak of (such speech producing self-consciousness, whereas part of our nature, it may be maintained, is healthy only while it lives and moves in holy blindness and unconsciousness of self), if there be any sphere of silence, then Whitman has been guilty of invading that sphere of silence. But he has done this by conviction that it is best to do so, and in a spirit as remote from base curiosity as from insolent licence. He deliberately appropriates a portion of his writings to the subject of the feelings of sex, as he appropriates another, 'Calamus,' to that of the love of man for man, 'adhesiveness,' as contrasted with 'amativeness,' in the nomenclature of Whitman, comradeship apart from all feelings of sex. That article of the poet's creed, which declares that man is very good, that there is nothing about him which is naturally vile or dishonourable, prepares him for absolute familiarity, glad, unabashed familiarity with every part and every act of the body. The ascetic teaching of many Medi\u00e6val writers is unfavourable to morality by its essential character: Whitman's may become unfavourable by accident. 'As to thy body, thou art viler than muck. Thou wast gotten of so vile matter, and so great filth, that it is shame for to speak, and abomination for to think. Thou shalt be delivered to toads and adders for to eat.' 'If thou say that thou lovest thy father and thy mother because thou art of their blood and of flesh gotten, so are the worms that come from them day by day. If thou love brethren or sisters or other kindred, because they are of the same flesh of father and mother and of the same blood, by the same reason should thou love a piece of their flesh, if it be shorn away.' 'All other sins [but wedlock] are nothing but sins, but this is a sin, and besides denaturalizes thee, and dishonours thy body. It soileth thy soul, and maketh it guilty before God, and moreover defileth thy flesh.' These were the views of pious persons of the thirteenth century. Here the body and the soul are kept in remote severance, each one the enemy of the other. Such spirituality, condemned alike by the facts of science and by the healthy natural human instincts, is seen by Whitman to be, even in its modern modifications, profoundly immoral. The lethargy of the soul induces it willingly to take up under some form or another with a theory which directs it heavenwards on the swift wings of devotional aspiration, rather than heavenwards for joy, but also earthwards for laborious duty, to animate, to quicken, to glorify all that apart from it is dull and gross. Both directions of the soul are declared necessary to our complete life by Whitman\u2014the one in solitude, the other in society.</p><p>'Only in the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of individuality may the spirituality of religion positively come forth at all. Only here, and on such terms, the meditation, the de-vout ecstasy, the soaring flight. Only here, communion with the mysteries, the eternal problems, whence? whither? Alone, and identity, and the mood,\u2014and the soul emerges, and all statements, churches, sermons, melt away like vapours. Alone, and silent thought, and awe, and aspiration,\u2014and then the interior consciousness, like a hitherto unseen inscription, in magic ink, beams out its wondrous lines, to the sense. Bibles may convey, and priests expound, but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of one's isolated self, to enter the pure ether of veneration, reach the divine levels, and commune with the unutterable.'</p><p>Then the soul can return to the body, and to the world, and possess them, and infuse its own life into them:\u2014</p><p>'I sing the Body electric;<br>The armies of those I love engirth me, and I <br>engirth them;<br>They will not let me off till I go with them, <br>respond to them,<br>And discorrupt them, and charge them full <br>with the charge of the soul.'</p><p>Having acknowledged that Whitman at times forgets that the 'instinct of silence,' as it has been well said, 'is a beautiful, imperishable part of nature,' and consequently that Whitman in a few passages falls below humanity, falls even below the modesty of brutes, everything has been acknowledged, and it ought not to be forgotten that no one asserts more strenuously than does Whitman the beauty, not indeed of asceticism, but of holiness or healthiness, and the shameful ugliness of unclean thought, desire, and deed. If he does not assert holiness as a duty, it is because he asserts it so strongly as a joy and a desire, and because he loves to see all duties transfigured into the glowing forms of joys and of desires. The healthy repose and continence, and the healthy eagerness and gratification of appetite, are equally sources of satisfaction to him. If in some of his lyrical passages there seems entire self-abandonment to passion, it is because he believes there are, to borrow his own phrase, 'native moments,' in which the desires receive permission from the supreme authority, conscience, to satisfy themselves completely:</p><p>'From the master\u2014the pilot I yield the vessel to;<br>The general commanding me, commanding all <br>\u2014from him permission taking.'</p><p>Whitman's most naked physical descriptions and enumerations are those of a robust, vigorous, clean man, enamoured of living, unashamed of body as he is unashamed of soul, absolutely free from pruriency of imagination, absolutely inexperienced in the artificial excitements and enhancements of jaded lusts. 'I feel deeply persuaded,' writes one of Whitman's critics who has received the impression of his mind most completely and faithfully, 'that a perfectly fearless, candid, ennobling treatment of the life of the body (so inextricably intertwined with, so potent in its influence on the life of the soul), will prove of inestimable value to all earnest and aspiring natures, impatient of the folly of the long prevalent belief that it is because of the greatness of the spirit that it has learned to despise the body, and to ignore its influences; knowing well that it is, on the contrary, just because the spirit is not great enough, not healthy and vigorous enough, to transfuse itself into the life of the body, elevating that and making it holy with its own triumphant intensity; knowing too how the body avenges this by dragging the soul down to the level assigned itself. Whereas the spirit must lovingly embrace the body, as the roots of a tree embrace the ground, drawing thence rich nourishment, warmth, impulse. Or rather the body is itself the root of the soul\u2014that whereby it grows and feeds. The great tide of healthful life that carries all before it must surge through the whole man, not beat to and fro in one corner of his brain. 'O the life of my senses and flesh, transcending my senses and flesh.' For the sake of all that is highest, a truthful recognition of this life, and especially of that of it which underlies the fundamental ties of humanity\u2014the love of husband and wife, fatherhood, motherhood\u2014is needed.'</p><p>The body then is not given authority over the soul by Whitman. Precisely as in the life of the nation a great material civilization seems admirable to him and worthy of honour, yet of little value in comparison with or apart from a great spiritual civilization, a noble national character, so in the life of the individual all that is external, material, sensuous, is estimated by the worth of what it can give to the soul. No Hebrew ever maintained the rights of the spiritual more absolutely. But towards certain parts of our nature, although in the poet's creed their rights are dogmatically laid down, he is practically unjust. The tendencies of his own nature lead him in his preaching to sink unduly certain articles of his creed. The logical faculty, in particular, is almost an offence to Whitman. The processes of reasoning appear to him to have elaboration for their characteristic, and nothing elaborated or manufactured seems of equal reality with what is natural and has grown. Truth he feels to be, as Wordsworth has said, 'a motion or a shape instinct with vital functions;' and were Whitman to seek for formal proof of such truth, he, like Wordsworth, would lose all feeling of conviction, and yield up moral questions in despair. 'A slumbering woman and child convince as an university course can never convince:'</p><p>'Logic and sermons never convince,<br>The damp of the night drives deeper into my <br>soul.'</p><p>Whitman becomes lyrical in presence of the imagination attempting for itself an interpretation of the problems of the world; he becomes lyrical in presence of gratified senses and desires; but he remains indifferent in presence of the understanding searching after conclusions. There is something like intolerance or want of comprehensiveness here; one's heart, touched by the injustice, rises to take the part of this patient, serviceable, despised understanding.</p><p>Whitman, as we have seen, accepts the persons of all men, but for a certain make of manhood he manifests a marked preference. The reader can guess pretty correctly from what has gone before what manner of man best satisfies the desires of the poet, and makes him happiest by his presence; and what is the poet's ideal of human character. The man possessed of the largest mass of manhood, manhood of the most natural quality, unelaborated, undistilled, freely displaying itself, is he towards whom Whitman is instinctively attracted. The heroes honoured by the art of an aristocracy are ideal, not naturalistic. Their characters are laboriously formed after a noble model, tempered as steel is tempered, welded together and wrought into permanent shape as their armour is. The qualities which differentiate them from most men are insisted upon. They are as little a growth of nature (in the vulgar sense of the word nature) as is a statue. Corneille's stoical heroes, for example, are the work of a great art applied to human character. Our true nature can indeed only be brought to light by such art processes, but there is an art which works with nature, and another art which endeavours to supersede it. Only through culture, only through the strenuous effort to conceive things at their best, not as they are, but as they may and ought to be, only through the persistent effort to constrain them to their ideal (that is their most real) shapes, can human character and human society and the works of man become truly natural. Such art does not supersede nature, but is rather nature obtaining its most perfect expression through the consciousness of man. So declares Polixenes in A Winter's Tale:\u2014</p><p>'Nature is made better by no mean,<br>But nature makes that mean; so, over that art,<br>Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art<br>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we <br>marry<br>A gentler scion to the wildest stock;<br>And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race: This is an art<br>Which does mend nature\u2014change it rather: but<br>The art itself is nature.'</p><p>Whitman has not failed to perceive this truth, but he fears that it may be abused. Meddling with nature is a dangerous process. Any idea or model, after which we attempt to shape our humanity, must proceed from some view of human nature, and our views are too often formal and contracted, manufactures turned out of the workshop of the intellect, of which the ultimate product cannot but be a formal and contracted character. But human nature itself is large and incalculable; and, if allowed to grow unconstrained and unperverted, it will exhibit the superb vitality and the unimpeachable rectitude of the perfect animal or blossoming tree. Using natural, then, in the vulgar sense, there are some men more than others a part of nature; men not modelled after an idea remote from the instincts of manhood; vigorous children of the earth, of wholesome activity, passionate, gay, defiant, proud, curious, free, hospitable, courageous, friendly, wilful. In such men Whitman sees the stuff of all that is most precious in humanity. 'Powerful uneducated persons' are the comrades he loves to consort with:\u2014</p><p>'I am enamour'd of growing outdoors;<br>Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the <br>ocean, or woods;<br>Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the<br> wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers <br>of horses;<br>I can eat and sleep with them week in and week <br>out.'</p><p>These are certainly not the persons who engage the imagination in the literature of an aristocracy.</p><p>It must not, however, be supposed that Whitman sets himself against culture. He would, on the contrary, studiously promote culture, but a culture which has another ideal of character than that growth of feudal aristocracies, and which, accepting the old perennial elements of noblest manhood, combines them 'into groups, unities appropriate to the modern, the democratic, the West.' No conception of manhood can be appropriate unless it be of a kind which is suitable not to the uses of a single class or caste, but to those of the high average of men. The qualities of character which are judged of most value by the democratic standard are not extraordinary, rare, exceptional qualities; the typical personality, which the culture sets before itself as its ideal, is one attainable by the average man. The most precious is ever in the common. Such a culture, Whitman holds, will be that of 'the manly and courageous instincts, and loving perceptions, and of self-respect.' Central in the character of the ideal man is the simple, unsophisticated Conscience, the primary moral element. 'If I were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread, respecting the America of our hopes, I should have to point to this particular\u2026. Our triumphant, modern Civilizee, with his all-schooling, and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains.' If Whitman appears to be antagonistic to culture, as we commonly understand or misunderstand the term, to refinement, intellectual acquisition, multiform and delicate sympathies, the critical spirit, it is 'not for absolute reasons, but current ones.' In our times, he believes, refinement and delicatesse 'threaten to eat us up like a cancer\u2026. To prune, gather, trim, conform, and ever cram and stuff, is the pressure of our days\u2026. Never, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholstered Exterior Appearance and show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea of caste, and on the sufficiency of mere outside acquisition\u2014never were glibness, verbal intellect more the test, the emulation\u2014more loftily elevated as head and sample,\u2014than they are on the surface of our Republican States this day.' In antagonism to the conception of culture which bears such fruit as this, Whitman desires one which, true child of America, shall bring joy to its mother, 'recruiting myriads of men, able, natural, perceptive, tolerant, devout, real men, alive and full.' In like manner Whitman's portraits of models of womanly Personality\u2014the young American woman who works for herself and others, who dashes out more and more into real hardy life, who holds her own with unvarying coolness and decorum, who will compare, any day, with superior carpenters, farmers, 'and even boatmen and drivers,' not losing all the while the charm, the indescribable perfume of genuine womanhood, or that resplendent person down on Long Island, known as the Peacemaker, well toward eighty years old, of happy and sunny temperament, a sight to draw near and look upon with her large figure, her profuse snow-white hair, dark eyes, clear complexion, sweet breath, and peculiar personal magnetism\u2014these portraits, he admits, are frightfully out of line from the imported Feudal models\u2014'the stock feminine characters of the current novelists, or of the foreign court poems (Ophelias, Enids, Princesses, or Ladies of one thing or another), which fill the envying dreams of so many poor girls, and are accepted by our young men, too, as supreme ideals of female excellence to be sought after. But I present mine just for a change.'</p><p>In the period of chivalry there existed a beautiful relation between man and man, of which no trace remains in existence as an institution\u2014that of knight and squire. The protecting, encouraging, downward glance of the elder, experienced, and superior man was answered by the admiring and aspiring, upward gaze of the younger and inferior. The relation was founded upon inequality; from the inequality of the parties its essential beauty was derived. Is there any possible relation of no less beauty, corresponding to the new condition of things, and founded upon equality? Yes, there is manly comradeship. Here we catch one of the clearest and most often reiterated notes of Whitman's song. The feelings of equality, individualism, pride, self-maintenance, he would not repress; they are to be as great as the soul is great; but they are to be balanced by the feelings of fraternity, sympathy, self-surrender, comradeship. European Radicals have for the most part been divided into two schools, with the respective watchwords of Equality and Fraternity. Whitman expresses the sentiments of both schools, while his position as poet rather than theorist or politician, saves him from self-devotion to any such socialistic or communistic schemes, as the premature interpretation of the feeling of fraternity into political institutions has given birth to in untimely abortion. One division of 'Leaves of Grass', that entitled 'Calamus' (Calamus being the grass with largest and hardiest spears and with fresh pungent bouquet), is appropriated to the theme of comradeship. And to us it seems impossible to read the poems comprised under this head without finding our interest in the poet Walt Whitman fast changing into hearty love of the man, these poems, through their tender reserves and concealments and betrayals, revealing his heart in its weakness and its strength more than any others. The chord of feeling which he strikes may be old\u2014as old as David and Jonathan\u2014but a fulness and peculiarity of tone are brought out, the like of which have not been heard before. For this love of man for man, as Whitman dreams of it, or rather confidently expects it, is to be no rare, no exceptional emotion, making its possessors illustrious by its singular preciousness, but it is to be widespread, common, unnoticeable.</p><p>'I hear it was charged against me that I <br>sought to destroy institutions;<br>But really I am neither for nor against insti-<br>tutions:<br>(What indeed have I in common with them? <br>Or what with the destruction of them?)<br>Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and <br>in every city of These States, inland and <br>seaboard,<br>And in the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large, that dents the water,<br>Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any <br>argument,<br>The institution of the dear love of comrades.'</p><p>In this growth of America, comradeship, which Whitman looks upon as a sure growth from seed already lying in the soil, he believes the most substantial hope and safety of the States will be found. In it he sees a power capable of counterbalancing the materialism, the selfishness, the vulgarity of American democracy\u2014a power capable of spiritualizing the lives of American men. Many, Whitman is aware, will regard this assurance of his as a dream; but such loving comradeship seems to him implied in the very existence of a democracy, 'without which it will be incomplete, in vain, and incapable of perpetuating itself.' In the following poem the tenderness and ardour of this love of man for man finds expression, but not its glad activity, its joyous fronting the stress and tumultuous agitation of life:\u2014</p><p>'When I heard at the close of the day how my <br>name had been receiv'd with plaudits in <br>the capitol, still it was not a happy <br>night for me that follow'd;<br>And else, when I carous'd, or when my plans <br>were accomplished, still I was not happy;<br>But the day when I rose at dawn from the <br>bed of perfect health, refresh'd, singing, <br>inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,<br>When I saw the full moon in the west grow <br>pale and disappear in the morning light,<br>When I wander'd alone over the beach, and <br>undressing, bathed, laughing with the <br>cool waters, and saw the sun rise,<br>And when I thought how my dear friend, my <br>lover, was on his way coming, O then I <br>was happy;<br>O then each breath tasted sweeter\u2014and all<br> that day my food nourish'd me more\u2014 <br>and the beautiful day pass'd well,<br>And the next came with equal joy\u2014and with <br>the next at evening, came my friend;<br>And that night, while all was still, I heard<br> the waters roll slowly continually up the <br>shores,<br>I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and<br> sands, as directed to me, whispering, to <br>congratulate me,<br>For the one I love most lay sleeping by me<br> under the same cover in the cool night,<br>In the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, <br>his face was inclined toward me,<br>And his arm lay lightly around my breast\u2014 <br>and that night I was happy.'</p><p>Various workings in the poems of Whitman of the influence of the principle of equality as realized in the society which surrounds him have now been traced. No portion of the poet's body of thought and emotion escapes its pervading power, and in a direct and indirect manner it has contributed to determine the character of his feeling with respect to external nature. In the way of crude mysticism Whitman takes pleasure in asserting the equality of all natural objects, and forces, and processes, each being as mysterious and wonderful, each as admirable and beautiful as every other; and as the multitude of men and women, so, on occasions, does the multitude of animals, and trees, and flowers press into his poems with the same absence of selection, the same assertion of equal rights, the same unsearchableness, and sanctity, and beauty, apparent or concealed in all. By another working of the same democratic influence (each man finding in the world what he cares to find) Whitman discovers everywhere in nature the same qualities, or types of the same qualities which he admires most in men. For his imagination the powers of the earth do not incarnate themselves in the forms of god and demi-god, faun and satyr, oread, dryad, and nymph of river and sea\u2014meet associates, allies or antagonists of the heroes of an age, when the chiefs and shepherds of the people were themselves almost demi- gods. But the great Mother\u2014the Earth\u2014is one in character with her children of the democracy, who, at last, as the poet holds, have learned to live and work in her great style. She is tolerant, includes diversity, refuses nothing, shuts no one out; she is powerful, full of vitality, generous, proud, perfect in natural rectitude, does not discuss her duty to God, never apologizes, does not argue, is incomprehensible, silent, coarse, productive, charitable, rich in the organs and instincts of sex, and at the same time continent and chaste. The grass Whitman loves as much as did Chaucer himself; but his love has a certain spiritual significance which Chaucer's had not. It is not the 'soft, swete, smale grass,' embroidered with flowers, a fitting carpet for the feet of glad knights and sportive ladies, for which he cares. In the grass he beholds the democracy of the fields, earthborn, with close and copious companionship of blades, each blade like every other, and equal to every other, spreading in all directions with lusty life, blown upon by the open air, 'coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious.' The peculiar title of his most important volume, 'Leaves of Grass', as Mr. Rossetti has finely observed, 'seems to express with some aptness the simplicity, universality, and spontaneity of the poems to which it is applied.'</p><p>The character of Whitman's feeling with respect to external nature bears witness to the joyous bodily health of the man. His communication with the earth, and sea, and skies, is carried on through senses that are never torpid, and never overwrought beyond the measure of health. He presses close to nature, and will not be satisfied with shy glances or a distant greeting. He enjoys the strong sensations of a vigorous nervous system, and the rest and recuperation which follow. His self-projections into external objects are never morbid; when he employs the 'pathetic fallacy' the world shares in his joyousness; he does not hear in the voices of the waters or of the winds echoes of a miserable egotism, the moan of wounded vanity, or the crying of insatiable lust. He is sane and vigorous. But his relation with nature is not one in which the senses and perceptive faculty have a predominant share. He passes through the visible and sensible things, and pursues an invisible somewhat\u2014</p><p>'A motion and a spirit that impels<br>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br>And rolls through all things;'</p><p>and of this he can never quite possess himself. 'There is [in his poems] a singular interchange of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While he sees men with even abnormal exactness as men, he sees them also 'as trees walking,' and admits us to perceive that the whole show is in a measure spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and profounder reality beneath it, of which it is giving perpetual intimations and auguries.'</p><p>In the direction of religion and philosophy there is in the democratic state of society a strong tendency, as De Tocqueville has shown, towards a pantheistic form of belief, and a strong tendency towards the spirit of optimism. The equality existing between citizens, and the habit of mind which refuses to observe the ancient artificial social distinctions, give the general intellect a turn for reducing things to unity, a passion for comprehending under one formula many objects, and reducing to one cause many and various consequences. Where castes or classes of society exist, one caste or class seems to object singularly little to the perdition of the inferior breeds of the human race\u2014'this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.' The Hind\u00fa could contemplate the fate of a Mlechha, the Jew, that of a Gentile, the Mahommedan, that of a Giaur, without overwhelming concern. But when the vision of a common life of the whole human race has filled the imagination, when a real feeling of solidarity is established between all the members of the great human community, the mind seems to shrink in horror from the suspicion that the final purposes of God or nature, with respect to man, can be other than beneficent. Society, in the democratic condition, is not fixed and desirous of conservation, but perpetually moving, and men's desires (apart from the results of scientific observation) induce them to hope, to conjecture, to believe that this movement is progressive. Biology and natural history with their doctrine of development and evolution, the science of origins with its surveys of the earliest history of our race seems to confirm the conviction, so flattering to men's desires, that nature and man harmoniously work under laws which tend towards a great and fortunate result. The events of the past are interpreted in the light of this conviction. Faith in the future becomes passionate, exists in the atmosphere, and obtaining nutriment from every wind, appears to sustain itself apart from all evidence\u2014that miracle which belongs to every popular faith. The past progress of the race, the great future of the race to match the greatness of its past, the broad dealings of Providence or of natural law with mankind\u2014when the thoughts of these, and feelings corresponding to such thoughts, have occupied the mind and heart, there appears something not only horrible, but something artificial, inconsequent, non-natural, in the notion of endless and fruitless penal suffering. And it is a noteworthy fact\u2014the more remarkable when we bear in mind the Puritanical basis of American religion\u2014that in the many new forms of religion which America has put forth as a tree puts forth leaves, in the many attempts towards the realization of a new conception of our relation to God and to one another, an almost constant element is the belief in the final happiness of all men.</p><p>The religious faith of Whitman, as far as it has definite form, reminds one of that taught in the Pedagogic Institution of Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre, in which from the Three Reverences inculcated, reverence for what is above us, reverence for what is around us, reverence for what is beneath us, springs the highest reverence, reverence for oneself. And with Whitman as with the Pedagogic company perfect reverence casts out fear. But he is not anxious to give his creed a precise form; he is so little interested in the exclusion of heretics that he does not require very accurate symbols and definitions.</p><p>'And I say to mankind, Be not curious about <br>God,<br>For I, who am curious about each, am not curi-<br>ous about God,<br>(No array of terms can say how much I am at <br>peace about God, and about death).'</p><p>Finding the present great and beautiful, contented with the past, but not driven into the past to seek for ideals of human character, and a lost golden age, Whitman has entire confidence in what the future will bring forth. He knows not what the purposes of life are for us, but he knows that they are good. Nowhere in nature can he find announcements of despair, or fixity of evil condition. He is sure that in the end all will be well with the whole family of men, and with every individual of it. The deformed person, the mean man, the infant who died at birth, the 'sacred idiot,' will certainly be brought up with the advancing company of men from whose ranks they have dropped:\u2014</p><p>'The Lord advances, and yet advances;<br>Always the shadow in front\u2014always the reach'd <br>hand, bringing up the laggards.'</p><p>At times this optimism leads Whitman to the entire denial of evil; 'he contemplates evil as, in some sense, not existing, or, if existing, then as being of as much importance as anything else;' in some transcendental way, he believes, the opposition of God and Satan cannot really exist. Practically, however, he is not led astray by any such transcendental reducing of all things to the Divine. Any tendency of a mystical kind to ignore the distinction between good and evil, is checked by his strong democratic sense of the supreme importance of personal qualities, and the inevitable perception of the superiority of virtuous over vicious personal qualities. By one who feels profoundly that the differences between men are determined, not by rank, or birth, or hereditary name or title, but simply by the different powers belonging to the bodies and souls of men, there is small danger of the meaning of bad and good being forgotten. And Whitman never really forgets this. The formation of a noble national character, to be itself the source of all literature, art, statesmanship, is that which above all else he desires. In that character the element of religion must, according to Whitman's ideal, occupy an important place, only inferior to that assigned to moral soundness, to conscience. 'We want, for These States, for the general character, a cheerful, religious fervour, imbued with the ever- present modifications of the human emotions, friendship, benevolence, with a fair field for scientific inquiry [to check fanaticism], the right of individual judgment, and always the cooling influences of material Nature.' These are not the words of one who moves the landmarks of right and wrong, and obscures their boundaries. For Whitman the worth of any man is simply the worth of his body and soul; each gift of nature, product of industry, and creation of art, is valuable in his eyes exactly in proportion to what it can afford for the benefit of body and soul. Only what belongs to these, and becomes a part of them, properly belongs to us\u2014the rest is mere 'material.' This mode of estimating values is very revolutionary, but to us it seems essentially just and moral. The rich man is not he who has accumulated unappropriated matter around him, but he who possesses much of what 'adheres, and goes forward, and is not dropped by death.'</p><p>Personality, character, is that which death cannot affect. Here again Whitman's democratic feeling for personality over-masters his democratic tendency towards pantheism. He clings to his identity and his consciousness of it, and will not be tempted to surrender that consciousness in imagination by the attractions of any form of nirvana. Death, which is a name to him full of delicious tenderness and mystery not without some element of sensuousness curiously blended with it\u2014('O the beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments, for reasons'), is but a solemn and immortal birth:\u2014</p><p>'Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft <br>feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest <br>welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee\u2014I glorify thee above <br>all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must in-<br>deed come, come unfalteringly.'</p><p>From such indications as these, and others that have gone before, the reader must gather, as best he can, the nature of Whitman's religious faith. But the chief thing to bear in mind is that Whitman cares far less to establish propositions than to arouse energy and supply a stimulus. His pupil must part from him as soon as possible, and go upon his own way.</p><p>'I tramp a perpetual journey\u2014(come listen all!)<br>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and <br>a staff cut from the woods;<br>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair;<br>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy;<br>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, or ex-<br>change;<br>But each man and each woman of you I lead <br>upon a knoll,<br>My left hand hooking you round the waist,<br>My right hand pointing to landscapes of conti-<br>nents, and a plain public road.'</p><p>That plain public road each man must travel for himself.</p><p>Here we must end. We have not argued the question which many persons are most desirous to put about Walt Whitman\u2014'Is he a poet at all?' It is not easy to argue such a question in a profitable way. One thing only need here be said,\u2014no adequate impression of Whitman's poetical power can be obtained from this article. A single side of his mind and of his work has been studied, but we have written with an abiding remembrance of the truth expressed by Vauvenargues:\u2014'Lorsque nous croyons tenir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201a par un endroit, elle nous \u00e9chappe par mille autres.'</p>", "date": "July 1871", "year": 1871, "creator": "Edward Dowden", "publication": "The Westminster Review", "citation": "Dowden, Edward [unsigned in original]. \"The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman.\" July 1871.

Having mastered the lessons of the past as much as any man, and scanned the present with a remarkably keen eye, he has turned his mental telescope on the future and sees visions there that we trust will by and by be realised. He tells us that America, filling the present with greatest deeds and problems, cheerfully accepting the past, including feudalism, (as, indeed, the present is but the legitimate birth of the past, including feudalism,) counts for her justification and success almost entirely in the future. Sole among nationalities, the United States have assumed the task to put in forms of lasting power and practicality, on areas of amplitude rivalling the operations of the physical cosmos, the moral and political speculations of ages, long, long deferred, the democratic republican principle, and the theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards and self suppliance. He does not gloss over the appalling dangers of universal suffrage in the States. It is, in fact, to admit and face these dangers he is writing. His eyes are open to the people's crudeness, vices, caprices; but in spite of these he is hopefully confident. Not the least doubtful is he on any prospects of the material success of the American Republic. Quoting Vice-President Colfax, he describes the progress of the Union, which, we should remember, is still in its infancy. From a territorial area of less than nine hundred thousand square miles, it has expanded over four millions and a half,\u2014a space fifteen times larger than Great Britain and France combined, with a shore line, including Alaska, equal to the entire circumference of the earth. In trade and commerce,\u2014railway traffic,\u2014manufacturing, mechanical, and mining industry,\u2014agriculture,\u2014population,\u2014the figures are correspondingly vast, and increasing by something like geometrical progression. But Walt Whitman is not satisfied with this, nor with any earnest or promise of material wealth to his native country. He says Democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil, 'until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of arts, poems, schools, theology, displacing all that exists, or that has been produced anywhere in the past, under opposite influences.' This is what he thinks is wanted in order to give America a real Unity, a Soul, a Conscience. So far the New World Democracy, however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materalistic development, products, and a certain highly deceptive superficial popular intellectuality, is an almost complete failure, he confesses, in its social aspects, in any superb general personal character, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, and esthetic results. 'In vain,' says he, 'do we march with unprecedented strides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain do we annex Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.' 'Everywhere, in ship, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning infidelity\u2014everywhere, the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe\u2014everywhere an abnormal libidinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignoned, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack omanners (considering the advantages enjoyed), probably the meanest to be seen in the world.' Yet underneath all this, which is shocking enough, the eye of the seer beholds, steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself, even in the midst of immense tendencies towards aggregation, the image of completeness in separation, of individual personal dignity, of a single person, either male or female, characterised in the main, not from extrinsic acquirements or position, but in the pride of himself or herself alone,\u2014the idea of that Something a man is, standing apart from all else, divine in his own right, and a woman in hers, 'sole and untouchable by any claims of authority, or any rule derived from precedent, state-safety, the acts of legislatures, or even from what is called religion, modesty, or art.' The purpose of democracy\u2014supplanting old belief in the necessary absoluteness of established dynastic rulership, temporal, ecclesiastical, and scholastic, as furnishing the only security against chaos, crime and ignorance\u2014is, through many transmigrations, and amid endless ridicules, arguments, and ostensible failures, to illustrate, at all hazards, the doctrine or theory that man, properly trained in sanest, highest freedom, may and must become a law, and a series of laws, unto himself, securing and providing for, not only his own personal control, but all his relations to other individuals and to the State; and that, while other theories, as in the past history of nations, have proved wise enough, and indispensable perhaps for their conditions, this, as matters now stand in our civilized world, is the only scheme worth working for, as warranting results like those of Nature's laws, reliable, when once established, to carry on themselves. Few probably are the minds, even in the United States, that fully comprehend as yet the aptness of that phrase, 'the Government of the People, by the People, for the People,' which Americans inherit from the lips of Abraham Lincoln,\u2014a formula whose verbal shape is homely wit, but whose scope includes both the totality and all minutae of the lesson which the New World is now engaged in learning itself, and will eventually teach to the whole world. Higher than the highest arbitrary rule, it is to train communities through all their grades, beginning with individuals and ending there again, to rule themselves. The problem which America has to solve is the inauguration, growth, acceptance, and unmistakeable supremacy among individuals, cities, States, and the Nation, of Moral Conscience, whose analogy in the material universe is what holds together the world, and every object upon it, and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe. Its lack, and the persistent shirking of it, in life, sociology, literature, politics, business, and even sermonizing in these times, or any times, still leaves the abysm, the mortal flaw and smutch, mocking civilization to-day, with all its unquestioned triumphs. But Walt Whitman hails with joy the oceanic, variegated, intense practical energy, the clamorous demand for facts, even the business material isms of the current age. For he expects they will at last engender, nourish, and develope ideas of a nobler kind, commensurate with humanity. The mark of progress is the growing mastership of the general inferior self by the superior self, in the individual, the nation, the race. And this is what he thinks, and we concur with him in thinking, America is destined to do, is doing, and will accomplish.</p>", "date": "May 21 1872", "year": 1872, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Sunderland Times", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Democratic Vistas].\" 21 May 1872.

Externally it bears a close resemblance to Leaves of Grass, but the likeness does not run through. The strong animalism of this astonishing author seems to be thoroughly aroused only under the influence of the muse; and though it is plain enough even when he writes in the prose form, it is not then offensive. We are inclined to suspect that a better test of his intrinsic quality will be found in these random and fugitive papers, some of them recording his experiences as a hospital nurse, many gathered from the pages of periodicals, than in the wilder and less genuine strains in which he has been accustomed to shout for the edification of feather-brained disciples. There is little in these confessions, communings with nature, forcible and often original descriptions of common-place objects, which can very well stir the enthusiasm of the howling dervishes of the new criticism; but there is a certain freshness and individuality which are always impressive, and an imaginative quality which sometimes rises very near the level of poetry if it does not reach it. And yet that Whitman has any new message to deliver to the world, that life, literature, philosophy have anything to gain from his thoughts, no perfectly sane person is likely to decide after a reading of his prose. In the 'Pieces in Early Youth' reprinted with the miscellania called Collect, it is apparent that Whitman once wrote very much like other people. </p>", "date": "October 14 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Tribune", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Specimen Days and Collect].\" 14 October 1882.

It is a meaty, compact volume, and is more directly comprehensible to the understanding of the multitude than the greater and more famous work. And yet this is as much Whitman as his verse is, and the same characteristics pervade it: grand healthiness of tone, largeness of view, universal reach, and, at the same time, deliberate perception and sensitiveness, and identity with nature, indissoluble and knit through and through with its fabric. Had 'Leaves of Grass' never been written this book alone would be enough to establish the author's fame as a great poet. In a personal letter Whitman writes:</p> <p>It is a great jumble (as man himself is)\u2014is an autobiography after its sort\u2014(sort 'o synonymous with Montaigne, and Rousseau's 'Confessions', etc.)\u2014is the gathering up and formulation and putting in identity of the wayside itemizings, memoranda and personal notes of 50 years under modern American conditions\u2014a good deal helter-skelter, but, I am sure, with a certain sort of orbic compaction and oneness as the final result. It dwells long on the secession war, gives glimpses of that event's strange interiors, especially the army hospitals; in fact, makes the resuscitation and putting on record of the emotional aspect of the war of 1861-65 one of its principal features.</p> <p>Indeed, too much stress cannot be laid upon this phase of the book. No history or description of the war that has yet been written probably gives such vivid and graphic pictures of its events\u2014its heroism, its horror, its sadness, the pathetic tenderness of countless of its incidents, and, above all, its grand significance. For this reason it ought to be dear to every soldier. During the years from 1876 to the present date Whitman has been a partial paralytic. Very much of his days (and nights, also, it appears) he has spent in the open air down in the country in the woods and fields, and by a secluded little New Jersey river. His memoranda, on the spot, of these days and nights, fill a goodly portion of the volume. Then comes the Collect, embodying 'Democratic Vistas,' the noble prose preface to Leaves of Grass of the edition of 1855, and much other prose, together with a number of youthful efforts in prose and poetry, which, in a note, the author explains he would have preferred to have them quietly dropped in oblivion, but, to avoid the annoyance of their surreptitious issue, he has, with some qualms, tacked them on. The whole volume, in its arrangement, is pregnant with Whitman's personality, and it seems more a part of its author than paper and printers' ink usually do. It also exhibits, as far as possible for any public record, that most wonderful and intricate of processes, the working of a poet's mind, and affords an insight into the mysterious interior depths and rambling galleries and chambers of the cosmic sphere whose large and rugged exterior is clothed with the fresh beauty of leaves of grass.</p> <p>The contents of the book take a wide range, as may be seen by the following samples: The old Whitman and Van Velsor Cemeteries\u2026Paumanok (Long Island, N. Y.) and My Life on It as Child and Young Man\u2026Printing Office\u2014Old Brooklyn\u2026Lafayette\u2026Broadway Sights\u2026My Passion for Ferries\u2026Omnibus Jaunts and Drivers\u2026Plays and Operas\u2026Opening of the Secession War\u2026Down at the Front\u2026The Army Hospitals\u2026Cases\u2026Preparations for Visits\u2026A New York Soldier\u2026A Yankee Antique\u2026Two Brothers, one South, one North\u2026the Grand Review\u2026 New Themes Entered upon (1876-'80)\u2026to the Spring and Brook\u2026A July Afternoon by the Pond\u2026Locusts and Katydids\u2026Full Starr'd Nights\u2026Mulleins\u2026A Sun-Bath\u2014Nakedness\u2026Human and Heroic New York\u2026Hours for the Soul\u2026Delaware River\u2014Days and Nights\u2026Scenes on the Ferry\u2026Begin a Long Jaunt West\u2026Missouri, Kansas, Colorado\u2026The Prairies, and an Undelivered Speech\u2026Denver Impressions\u2026The Spanish Peaks\u2014Evening on the Plains\u2026the Arkansas\u2026The Silent General\u2026the Women of the West\u2026St. Louis\u2026Edgar Poe's Significance\u2026Loafing in the Woods\u2026Jaunting through Canada\u2026the Saguenay\u2026Capes Eternity and Trinity\u2026Carlyle from American Points of View\u2026A Week in Boston\u2026Collect\u2026Democratic Vistas\u2026Prefaces to 'Leaves of Grass,' l855, 1872, 1876\u2026Poetry Today in America\u2026Death of Abraham Lincoln\u2026Stories and Sketches Written in Youth (1834-1842).</p> <p>In 'Specimen Days' there is a vein of playfulness, and a humor\u2014if it may be called so\u2014probably different from anything yet in literature. The following is an example of this quality, and it is also an excellent characterization of the book:</p><p><strong>CEDAR PLUMS LIKE\u2014NAMES.</strong></p><p>One time I thought of naming this collection 'Cedar-Plums Like' (which I still fancy wouldn't have been a bad name, nor inappropriate.) A melange of loafing, looking, hobbying, sitting, traveling\u2014a little thinking thrown in for salt but very little\u2014not only summer but all seasons\u2014not only days but nights\u2014some literary meditations\u2014books, authors examined, Carlyle, Poe, Emerson tried (always under my cedar tree, in the open air, and never in the library)\u2014mostly the scenes everybody sees, but some of my own caprices, meditations, egotism\u2014truly an open air and mainly summer formation\u2014singly or in clusters\u2014wild and free and somewhat acrid\u2014indeed more like cedar plums than you might guess at first glance.</p> <p>But do you know what they are? (To city man, or some sweet parlor lady, I now talk.) As you go along roads, or barrens, or across country, anywhere through these states, middle, eastern, western or southern, you will see, certain seasons of the year, the thick woody tufts of the cedar mottled with bunches of china-blue berries, about as big as fox grapes. But first a special word for the tree itself; everybody knows that the cedar is a healthy, cheap, democratic wood, streaked red and white\u2014an evergreen\u2014that it is not a cultivated tree\u2014that it keeps away moths\u2014that it grows inland or seaboard, all climates, hot or cold, any sort\u2014in fact, rather prefers sand and bleak side spots content if the plough and fertilizer and the trimming axe will but keep away and let it alone. After a long rain, when everything looks bright, often have I stopt in my wood saunters, south or north, or far west, to take in its dusky green washed clean and sweet, and specked copiously with its fruit of clear, hardy blue. The wood of the cedar is of use\u2014but what profit on earth are those sprigs of acrid plums? A question impossible to answer satisfactorily. True, some of the herb doctors give them for stomache affections, but the remedy is as bad as the disease. Then, in my rambles down in Camden county, I once found an old crazy woman gathering the clusters with zeal and joy. She showed, as I was told afterward, a sort of infatuation for them, and every year placed and kept profuse bunches high and low about her room. They had a strange charm about her uneasy head, and effected docility and peace. (She was harmless, and lived near by with her well-off married daughter.) Whether there is any connection between these bunches and being out of one's wits I cannot say, but I myself entertain a weakness for them. Indeed, I love the cedar, anyhow\u2014its naked ruggedness, its just palpable odor (so different from the perfumer's best), its silence, its equable acceptance of winter's cold and summer's heat, of rain or drought, its shelter to me from those, at times, its associations (well, I never could explain why I love anybody or anything). The service I now specially owe to the cedar is, while I cast around for a name for my proposed collection, hesitating, puzzled\u2014after rejecting a long, long string, I lift my eyes, and lo; the very term I want. At any rate, I go no further\u2014I tire in the search. I take what some invisible kind spirit has put before me. Besides, who shall say there is not affinity enough between (at least the bundle of sticks that produced) many of these pieces or granulations and those blue berries? Their lusciousness growing wild\u2014a certain aroma of nature I would so like to have in my pages\u2014the thing soft whence they come\u2014their content in being let alone\u2014their stolid and deaf repugnance to answering questions (this latter the nearest, dearest trait affinity of all). Then, reader dear, in conclusion, as to the point of the name for the present collection, let us be satisfied to have a name\u2014something to identify and bind it together, to concrete all its vegetable, mineral, personal memoranda, abrupt raids of criticism, crude gossip of philosophy, varied sands and clumps\u2014without bothering ourselves because certain pages do not present themselves to you or me as coming under their own name with entire fitness or amiability. (It is a profound, vexatious, never-explicable matter\u2014this of names. I have been exercised deeply about it my whole life.)</p><p>After all of which the name 'Cedar-Plums Like' got its nose put out of joint; but I cannot afford to throw away what I pencil'd down the lane there, under the shelter of my old friend, one warm October noon. Besides, it wouldn't be civil to the cedar tree.</p><p>The parts that deal with the war have been emphasized as forming one of the most important phases of the work. Here is an incident from the author's war experience which gives a better glance into the secession contest than all the formal military reports and statistics of the period:</p><p><strong>A YANKEE ANTIQUE.</strong></p><p>March 27, 1885. Sergt. Calvin F. Harlowe, company C. 29th Massachusetts, 3d brigade, 1st division, 9th corps\u2014a mark'd sample of heroism and death (some may say bravado, but I say heroism, of grandest, oldest order)\u2014in the late attack by the rebel troops, and temporary capture by them, of Fort Steadman, at night. The fort was surprised at dead of night. Suddenly awaken'd from their sleep, and rushing from their tents, Harlowe, with others, found himself in the hands of the secesh\u2014they demanded his surrender\u2014he answered: 'Never while I live.' (Of course it was useless. The others surrender'd; the odds were too great.) Again he was ask'd to yield, this time by a rebel captain. Though surrounded, and quite calm, he again refused, call'd sternly to his comrades to fight on, and himself attempted to do so. The rebel captain then shot him\u2014but at the same instant he shot the captain. Both fell together mortally wounded. Harlowe died almost instantly. The rebels were driven out in a very short time. The body was buried next day, but soon taken up and sent home (Plymouth county, Mass.). Harlowe was only 22 years of age\u2014was a tall, slim, dark-hair'd, blue-eyed young man\u2014had come out originally with the 29th; and that is the way he met his death after four years' campaign. He was in the seven days' fight before Richmond, in second Bull Run, Antietam, first Fredericksburg, Vicksburg, Jackson, Wilderness, and the campaigns following-was as good a soldier as ever wore the blue, and every old officer in the regiment will bear that testimony. Though so young, and in a common rank, he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero for the books, ancient or modern; it was too great to say 'I surrender'\u2014and so he died. (When I think of such things, knowing them well, all the vast and complicated events of the war, on which history dwells and makes its volumes, fall aside, and for the moment at any rate I see nothing but young Calvin Harlowe\u2019s figure in the night, disdaining to surrender.)</p><p><strong>LITERARY CRITICISM.</strong></p><p>There are many scattered dashes of poetic and literary criticism, evidently negligent and impromptu. On one of the concluding pages, for instance, the following:</p> <p>LI tried to read a beautifully printed and scholarly volume on 'the Theory of Poetry' received by mail this morning from England\u2014but gave it up at last for a bad job. Here are some capricious pencillings that followed, as I find them in my notes</p> <p>In youth and maturity poems are charged with sunshine and varied pomp of the day, but as the soul more and more takes precedence (the sensuous still included), the dusk becomes the poet's atmosphere. I, too, have sought, and ever seek, the brilliant sun, and make my songs according. But, as I grow old, the half-lights of evening are far more to me.</p> <p>The play of imagination, with the sensuous objects of nature for symbols, and faith\u2014with love and pride as the unseen impetus and moving power of all, make up the curious chess game of a poem.</p> <p>Common teachers or critics are always asking: 'What does it mean?' Symphony of the fine musician, or sunset, or sea waves rolling up the beach\u2014what do they mean? Undoubtedly, in the most subtle elusive sense, they mean something\u2014as love does, and religion does, and the best poem\u2014but who shall fathom and define those meanings? I do not intend this as a warrant for wildness and frantic escapades, but to justify the soul's frequent joy in what cannot be defined to the intellectual part or to calculation:</p><p>At its best, poetic lore is like what may be heard of conversation in the dusk, from speakers near or far, of which we get only a few broken mummers. What is not gather'd is far more\u2014perhaps the main thing.</p><p>Grandest poetic passages are only to be taken at free remove, as we sometimes look for stars at night, not by gazing directly toward them, but off one side.</p><p>(To a poetic student and friend.) I only seek to put you in rapport. Your own brain, heart, evolution, must not only understand the matter, but largely supply it.</p><p>His criticism on 'Edgar Poe's Significance' is an example of the best critical powers, and shows a high moral judgment. He says 'there is another shape of personality dearer far to the artist sense (which likes the play of strongest lights and shades), where the perfect character, the good, the heroic, although never attained, is never lost sight of, but, through failures, sorrows, temporary downfall, is return'd to again and again, and while often violated is passionately alluded to as long as mind, muscles, voice obey the power we call volition. This sort of personality we see more or less in Burns, Byron, Schiller and George Sand. But we do not see it in Edgar Poe.*** Almost without the first sign of moral principle or of the concrete or its heroisms, or the simpler affections of the heart, Poe's verses illustrate an intense faculty\u2014for technical and abstract beauty, with the rhyming art to excess, and an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal themes, a demoniac undertone behind every page, and, by final judgment, probably belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature, brilliant and dazzling, but with no heat.' Again, he says: 'By its popular poets the calibres of an age, the weak spots of its embankments, its subcurrents (often more significant than the biggest surface ones), are unerringly indicated. The lush and weird that have taken such extraordinary possession of 19th century verse-lovers, what mean they?'</p><p><strong>RUSSIA AND AMERICA.</strong></p><p>Occasionally throughout the book, and as notable as any parts, are some of Whitman's special letters. Here, for example, is one which tells its own story.</p><p>CAMDEN, N. J., U. S. A., Dec. 20, 1881.</p><p>To \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014(Dresden, Saxony): Your letter asking definite endorsement to your translation of my 'Leaves of Grass' into Russian is just received, and I hasten to answer it. Most warmly and willingly I consent to the translation, and wish a prayerful God speed to the enterprise.</p> <p>You Russians and we Americans! Our countries so distant, so unlike at first glance\u2014such a difference in social and political conditions, and our respective methods or moral and practical development the last 100 years and yet in certain features, and vastest ones, so resembling each other. The variety of stock elements and tongues, to be resolutely fused in a common identity and union at all hazards\u2014the idea, perennial through the ages\u2014that they both have their historic and divine mission\u2014the fervent element of manly friendship throughout the whole people, surpass'd by no other races\u2014the grand expanse of territorial limits and boundaries\u2014the unform'd and nebulous state of many things, not yet permanently settled, but agreed on all hands to be the preparations of an infinitely greater future\u2014the fact that both peoples have their independent and leading positions to hold, keep, and if necessary, fight for, against the rest of the world\u2014the deathless aspirations at the inmost center of each great community, so vehement, so mysterious, so abysmic\u2014are certainly features you Russians and we Americans possess in common.</p> <p>As my dearest dream is for an internationality of poems and poets, binding the lands of the earth closer than all treaties and diplomacy; as the purpose beneath the rest in my book is such hearty comradeship, for individuals to begin with, and for all the nations of the earth as a result\u2014how happy I should be to get the healing and emotional contact of the great Russian peoples.</p> <p>To whom, now and here, (addressing you for Russia and Russians, and empowering you, should you see fit, to print the present letter in your book, as a preface,) I waft affectionate salutation from these shores, in America's name.</p><p>W. W.</p><p><strong>WHITMAN AT PRESENT.</strong></p><p>The following extract from a letter to a German friend gives a picture of the poet's condition at present:</p><p>May 31, '82. From today I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis that first affected me nearly 10 years ago has since remain'd with varying course\u2014seems to have settled quietly down, and will probably continue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk far; but my spirits are first-rate. I go around in public almost every day\u2014now and then take long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles\u2014live largely in the open air\u2014am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)\u2014keep up my activity and interest in life, people, progress and the questions of the day. About two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality I ever had remains entirely unaffected; though physically, I am a half-paralytic, and likely to be so, long as I live. But the principal object of my life seems to have been accomplish'd\u2014I have the most devoted and ardent of friends and affectionate relatives\u2014and of enemies I really make no account.</p><p>It is understood that Whitman himself considers 'Specimen Days' as the exponent and finish of his poetic work, 'Leaves of Grass'; that each of the two volumes is indispensable, in his view, to the other, and that both together finally begin and illustrate his literary scheme in the new world. Talking lately, in a half-jocular vein, to a friend, he called them his Adam and Eve, sent out in 'this garden, the world.'</p><p>The book is issued in precisely the same style as 'Leaves of Grass,' with the same cloth binding, the same butterfly on the [illegible] and the same price. It contains a faithful likeness of Whitman, in out-door attire, and sitting watching a butterfly that has lit on his finger.

Specimen Days and Collect Philadelphia: Ress, Welsh & Co. New York: R. Worthington. 12mo. cloth. pp. 374.</p><p>So painfully impressed it Mr. Whitman with the idea that every deed and experience of a man's life, nay, every sight and sound and touch and taste and smell, should be recorded that it is strange he has not sooner written his autobiography. For, although it is not easy to assert with confidence precisely what Mr. Whitman means in a poem or an essay or a volume, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that he means this volume of avowed prose to be his autobiography. He begins it with a memorandum ('mem.,' as he is fond of neglecting to write it) made 'Down in the Woods July 2, 1882,' in which he says: 'If I do it at all I must delay no longer.' 'It' presumably means to leave to a curious posterity a record of Himself and incidentally also of America\u2014these States\u2014Democracy\u2014Long Island\u2014ferry-boats, plains and the multitudinous oceanic eligibilities of this wondrous All. This purpose is more definitely explained in another sentence of this 'mem.,' if by courtesy it may be called a sentence, which will serve both as an index and as a specimen:</p><p>Incongruous and full of skips and jumps as is the huddle of diary jottings, war memoranda of 1862\u201365, nature notes of 1877\u201381, with Western and Canadian observations afterwards, all bundled up and tied by a big string, the resolution and indeed mandate comes to me this day, this hour\u2014(and what a day! what an hour just passing! the luxury of riant gloss and blowing breeze with all the shows of sun and sky and perfect temperature never before so filling me body and soul)\u2014to go home, untie the bundle, reel out diary scraps and memoranda just as they are, large or small, one after another, into print-pages, and let the melange's lackings and wants of connection take care of themselves.</p><p>'Maybe, if I don't do anything else,' he says, and he might have omitted the doubting and conditional phrases, 'I shall send out the most wayward, spontaneous, fragmentary book ever printed \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 without any definite purpose that can be told in a statement.' Following this introduction is a slovenly sketch of his life. In a semi-Biblical fashion he writes out the genealogy of the Whitmans and of the Van Velsors (his mother's family), both of which for several generations lived on Long Island. 'Out from these arrieres of persons and scenes, I was born May 31, 1819. \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 The successive growth-stages of my infancy, childhood, youth and manhood were all pass'd on Long Island, which I sometimes feel as if I had incorporated.' He spent these years 'absorbing fields, shores, marine incidents, characters, the bay-men, farmers, pilots\u2014always had a plentiful acquaintance with the latter and with fishermen\u2014went every summer on sailing trips\u2014always liked the bare sea-beach, south side, and have some of my happiest hours on it to this day.' His father, who was a carpenter, moved to Brooklyn and the boy was employed for a time in a lawyer's office. 'Clarke's, Fulton street, near Orange.' Afterwards he became a printer and did work for several newspapers. In 1849 he worked his way to New Orleans and was employed first as a printer and later for a short time as editor of the Crescent. He was once editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, but 'the trouble in the Democratic party broke forth about those times (1848\u201349) and I split off with the Radicals, which led to rows with the boss and 'the party,' and I lost my place.' During these years of life as a journalist in Brooklyn and New York (for he did not remain long in New Orleans) he developed his passion for ferries. 'Indeed I have always had a passion for ferries; to me they afford inimitable, streaming, never-failing, living poems.' He had a passion also for omnibus drivers. He fills half a page with the names of the drivers whom he remembers and tells of his delight in declaiming Homer (Pope's Homer!) and Shakespeare from the top of a stage while he was going up Broadway. 'The influence of those Broadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades undoubtedly enter'd into the gestation of 'Leaves of Grass.'' Soon after the war began he went to Washington and remained in the hospitals there and in Virginia until the war ended. Then he secured a subordinate appointment in the Government service and filled it for several years. Stricken with paralysis, he retired to Camden, N.J., where he has since resided. He has visited Boston and the principal cities in Canada and in the West. While in the West he wrote for the Jimplecute. Extracts from his war diary and from his notes taken 'down in the woods' in New Jersey and during his journey through Canada and the West make up the 'Specimen Days.' The 'Collect' consists of his essay on America\u2014these States\u2014Democracy\u2014&c., &c., &c. (to quote his own favorite phrase), and critical essays on Carlyle, Emerson, Lincoln and other men and on literary subjects, the most of which have before been printed in the periodicals. An appendix contains a few early tales and poems.</p><p>The hospital notes are printed in the slovenly shape in which they were written in his diary. Scenes at deathbeds, reflections on war, descriptions of wounds and essays on moonlight are all jumbled together. The book is not even divided into chapters. In these pages of blood and slang, of slaughtered men and sentences, of egotism and heroic endurance are a few splendid thoughts. the following are fair specimens of good and of bad:</p><p>No formal general's report nor book in the library, nor columns in the paper, embalms the bravest. North or South, East or West. Unnamed, unknown, remain, and still remain, the bravest soldiers. \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 Likely, the typic one of them (standing, no doubt, for hundreds, thousands,) crawls aside to some bush-clump or ferny tuft on receiving his death-shot\u2014there sheltering a little while, soaking roots, grass and soil with red blood\u2014the battle advances, retreats, flits from the scene, sweeps by\u2014and there, happily with pain and suffering (yet less, far less, than is supposed) the last lethargy winds like a serpent round him\u2014the eyes glaze in death\u2014none recks\u2014perhaps the burial-squads, in truce, a week afterwards, search not the secluded spot\u2014and there, at last, the Bravest Soldier crumbles in mother earth, unburied and unknown.</p><p>Saturday, January 30.\u2014Afternoon, visited Campbell Hospital. Scene of cleaning up the ward and giving the men all clean clothes\u2014through the ward (6), the patients dressing or being dress\u2019d\u2014the naked upper half of the bodies\u2014the good-humor and fun\u2014the shirts, drawers, sheets of beds, &c., and the general fixing up for Sunday. Gave J.L. 50 cents.</p><p>In his observations of nature there is nothing new, but there are a few plain truths (truths which at least since Wordsworth have been the common property of all who ramble in the woods) which are expressed with the freshness of keen observation. Others are most awkward and slovenly efforts to be original:</p><p>'The emotional aspects and influences of Nature!' he exclaims. 'I, too, like the rest, feel these modern tendencies (from all the prevailing intellections, literature and poems) to turn everything to pathos, ennui, morbidity, dissatisfaction, death. Yet how clear it is to me that those are not the born results, influences of Nature at all, but of one's own distorted, sick and silly soul. Here, amid this wild, free scene, how healthy, how joyous, how clean and vigorous and sweet!'</p><p>And then such lapses as these:</p><p>By my great oak\u2014sturdy, vital, green\u2014give feet thick at the butt.</p><p>A grand twelve-acre field of ripe cabbages, with their prevailing hue of malachite green, and floating\u2014flying over and among them in all directions, myriads of these same white butterflies. </p><p>An hour or so after breakfast I wended my way down to the recesses of the aforesaid dell \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 It was just the place and time for my Adamic air-bath and flesh-brushing from head to foot. So hanging clothes on a rail near by, keeping old broad-brim straw on head and easy shoes on feet, haven\u2019t I had a good time the last two hours! First with the stiff-elastic bristles rasping arms, breast, sides, till they turn\u2019d scarlet\u2014then partially bathing in the clear waters of the running brook\u2014taking everything very leisurely, with many rests and pauses\u2014stepping about barefooted every few minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze, for unctuous mud-bath to my feet\u2014 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 feeling quite secure from obtrusion (and that indeed I am not at all nervous about, if it accidentally happens.) \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 Nature was naked, and I was also. \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 Is nakedness then indecent? No, not inherently.</p><p>Such perverse and eccentric enthusiasm is as poor a substitute for originality as dashes and catalogues of words are for sentences; but among these 'nature-notes' are a few sane, clear and piercing thoughts\u2014glimpses of Jersey in summer without mosquitoes. Whitman boasts of his scientific ignorance of natural history and of botany and refuse to contemplate any object except as a savage, and he thus denies himself the keenest enjoyment of nature as effectively as the mere scientist. The struggle against a theory or habit begets a theory or a habit not less fatal than the one so persistently avoided, and his egotistic disdain of the simplest facts not only makes his own enjoyment less than it would otherwise be, but also makes the most of his notes unintelligible and ridiculous to others. He is an exaggeration of the least happy phase of Thoreau, and his work bears the same relation to the work of his delightful friend, John Burroughs, that the mud in a brick-mill bears to a house.</p><p>'Democratic Vistas,' the long essay in the 'Collect' is a dense cloud, a whirlwind of words and an occasional flash of clear thought. It is what in his own vocabulary might be called an 'oceanic' iteration of the one idea which he has been 'called' to assert:</p><p>Our fundamental want to-day in the United States, with closest, amplest reference to present conditions, and to the future, is of a class, and the clear idea of a class, of native authors, literatures, far different, far higher in grade than any yet known, sacerdotal, modern, fit to cope with our occasions, lands, permeating the whole mass of American mentality, taste, belief, breathing into it a new breath of life, giving it decision, affecting politics far more than the popular superficial suffrage, with results inside and underneath the elections of Presidents or Congresses\u2014radiating, begetting appropriate teachers, schools, manners, and, as its grandest result, accomplishing, (what neither the schools nor the churches and the clergy have hitherto accomplish'd, and without which this nation will no more stand, permanently, soundly, than a house will stand without a substratum,) a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of the States. \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 a new Literature, perhaps a new Metaphysics, certainly a new Poetry, are to be, in my opinion, the only sure and worthy supports and expressions of the American Democracy.</p><p>In Whitman's well-known ideas of poetry (intelligently formulated in his criticism but exemplified with disastrous vagueness in his own 'poems') there is one wholesome truth and a deserved rebuke to the poetic fashion of the day. Yet this truth\u2014that culture and art cannot supply the lack of originality and vigor\u2014is as old as criticism; and in his assertion of it he has imitated the owner of a forest who assured a lumberman that his trees were so straight that they leaned the other way. Still the repetition of this single idea, made with a grotesque force and applied to present conditions, is the most important (doubtless the only important) result of his work.</p><p>'The lust and the weird,' he asks, 'that have taken such extraordinary possession of Nineteenth century verse-lovers\u2014what mean they? The inevitable tendency of poetic culture to morbidity, abnormal beauty\u2014the sickliness of all technical thought or refinement in itself\u2014the abnegation of the perennial and democratic concretes at first hand, the body, the earth and the sea, sex and the like\u2014and the substitution of something for them at second or third hand\u2014what bearings have they on current pathological study?</p><p>The curiosities (or, to speak plainly, the barbarities) of Mr. Whitman's vocabulary would be rich matter for Mr. E. A. Freeman to use in his essay on the peculiarities of American speech. A few of the words that he is fond of using are: 'Secesh,' 'hard-pan,' 'grub' (food), 'shebang,' 'broke' (having no money), 'skedaddle,' 'top-loftical,' 'crack' (famous), 'swell' (fashionable), 'boss' (employer), 'literatuses,' 'philosophs.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman is one of the few writers who have anything to say whose volumes the desecrating condenser could improve. A judicious editor could select enough passages from the two bundles of scraps which he calls volumes to make a small book worthy of preservation.

Received from David McKay.</p><p>This book is in two parts; the first part is devoted principally to the author's experience in Washington, during the War, visiting the sick and wounded. His kindliness of heart and broad humanity are manifested on every page, and one cannot but regret that he did not have the strength, or the inclination, or both, to make a continuous narration of it, instead of the sketchy little notes with which he has furnished us. Besides these War episodes, he gives us an insight into his love of Nature, and the keen delight he experiences in the open air, in the sun, in the oak, in the full starr'd nights, the common earth\u2014the soil and the skies. Indeed, these short sketches contain material that would make the fortune of a commonwealth of rhyme-makers. He also gives us his impressions of Carlyle and Emerson, of Longfellow, Whittier, and Bryant, impressions evidently softened by age, for his present opinion of Carlyle is not what, we would have looked for in Walt Whitman, and one not at all consistent with the spirit of his 'Democratic Vistas' in the 'Collect.'</p><p>He gives us, likewise, an appreciative critique on Jean Francois Millets's 'Sower,' 'the Diggers,' 'the Angelus' and 'Field-People Reposing.' A view of these pictures certainly has the effect of making the blood boil, and the heart fire-up with much the same sort of flame as burned in the hearts of the Jacquerie. One could have foretold the French Revolution from these pictures, had they been painted in time.</p><p>He also reveals to us his departure from his previous customs, as depicted in the horrible juvenilities in the back of the book. It is a pity the book was disfigured with them. He gives us therein a frightful picture of intemperance, much as a ten-year old Cadet would have done. But on page 188, he owns to draining 'big, brimming, fill'd-up champagne-glasses \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 to the last drop.'</p> <p>The second part, or 'Collect,' is much the more elaborate portion of the work. In 'Democratic Vistas' he gives a thoughtful review of our country, as to its literature, and its political life. Though the acknowledged poet of the 'People of these States,' he does not take a rose-colored view of them, by any means, politically speaking. He says: 'Never was there more hollowness at heart than at present, and here in these United States. \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 The underlying principles of these States are not honestly believed in. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. The men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful superciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the literateurs is something to make fun of. Conversation is a mass of badinage. \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The official services of America, national, state, and municipal, in all their branches and department, except the judiciary, are saturated in corruption, bribery, falsehood and mal-administration; and the judiciary is tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In business, (this all-devouring modern word, business) the one sole object is by any means pecuniary gain. The magician's serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents; and money-making is our magician's serpent, remaining to-day, sole master of the field. The best class we show, is but a mob of fashionably dressed speculators and vulgarians.'</p> <p>Yet of the people he does not despair. Their heroism in the camp, in the battle, and in the hospitals, has convinced him that the material for a great people is at hand. But they must be awakened. Reformers are needed, and though they speak rashly, eagerly, and often inconsiderately, their ill-balanced enthusiasm in the right direction is necessary to disturb the 'inertness and fossilism of human institutions.' This direct exposition of the lamentable defects in our body-politic, is timely, just when the leaven of improvement is beginning to work,\u2014with what result, time only will show. Whether our present system is able to evolve a better state from itself, or whether an entirely new, or at least, a greatly changed form will be necessary to accomplish the desired result, it is now impossible to tell. That our political future is at all doubtful we have no reason to suppose. Though we may go back for a time, though corporations and political bosses may hold our people in bondage for a while, the spirit of civilized communism and socialism is not far enough removed from the minds of our American laboring classes, but a revolution may be inaugurated at any moment. As Walt Whitman says, 'practically, strikes are attempted revolutions, and the Revolutionary War, and the French Revolution were strikes.'</p><p>Walt Whitman attacks, more particulary, our literature, and in fact, all literature. He finds Shakespeare and Scott the poets of the great lords\u2014nowhere are there poets of the people. But it seems to us he fails to recognize at their true value, the poetry of the novelists. He dislikes romances, and does not give them any place. Yet Dickens is as clearly the poet of the people as Walt Whitman, himself. And Victor Hugo, in the French, and Auerbach, in the German. But his greatest grievance is that there is no American literature, as such. But he again is unjust in a measure. Of course, he has no humor, and can recognize no use in it. But Artemus Ward is as redolent of the American soil as Walt Whitman, and while he is not, in any sense, a champion of the people, but rather their satirist. Mark Twain, inferior, it is true, but yet American throughout, is thoroughly republican in thought, tendency and expression. So, also Bret Harte, inefficient and ultra-sentimental, and often weak and incomplete. But granted that we have no distinctive American literature, with the exception of Walt Whitman himself, it was six hundred years after the English nation was formed before Chaucer, the first of English national poets, appeared. And what a long interval elapsed before a great one followed him. And thus, while the nation was untrammeled by traditions and forms. We, who have not assimilated the numerous ingredients furnished us by foreign countries, are not yet even a nation\u2014perhaps, have not even a stable government. We have inherited a rich literature, which we have imbibed in infancy, which is taught in our schools as the model of all that is desirable in thought and style. To strike out a vigorous Republican poem in a country that persecutes the Chinese, that stigmatizes one day the Jews, another the Catholics, and another day some other race or religion, would be almost a sarcasm. It is not a Republic where wealth purchases immunity for crime, where the sheriff furnishes desirable juries, and the prosecuting attorney takes care of the criminal. The administration of justice must be improved, to the end that the voice of the people will be heard\u2014that the government, through its officers, will represent the will of the people. Then, and then only, will we become a nation with national characteristics\u2014and not in the meantime, a colony of Great Britain, speaking the same language, singing the same songs, and generally remaining the unconsidered minor performers in the theatre of English literature.</p><p>But it takes time for all this, and we have reason to be proud that only eighty years after the sounding of the tocsin of American independence, we have already had our Chaucer\u2014Walt Whitman.</p>", "date": "November 2 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Philadelphia Quiz", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Specimen Days and Collect].\" 2 November 1882.

His prose is better than his poetry. It is clean. It is sane. It is intelligible. It is often readable. Much of it is really interesting, because either of its autobiographical effect, its reminiscential quality, or its frank fresh mirroring of out-of-door life and sensation. The book is virile. In many places it has the smell of damp loam or of new-mown grass. It is honest and justifiable. It contains the prose work of its author's life, and shows him at his best all through. Its title, its title-page in the author's rugged autograph, its make-up, and its literary style are all characteristic; and the heliotype portrait, facing p. 122, is strikingly good. The contents are brief essays or sketches, mostly fragmentary, many of them dated as if they were leaves torn from a diary. The first and longest group, occupying 200 pages, is denominated 'Specimen Days.' Following these, under the heads of 'Collect' and 'Notes Left Over' come 150 or more pages of nearly similar material. The volume closes with a hundred pages of 'Pieces in Early Youth,' printed subordinately in fine type. The book is unobjectionable so far as we have noticed, and there is not a little that can be said in its favor.</p><p>Many readers will be interested at once in the opening pages for the details they furnish of Mr. Whitman's ancestry and life. He was born on Long Island, May 31, 1819; and grew up on its shores studying sea-fowl, fishes and fisher-men, wrecks, and nature generally in her wilder moods. As he writes, he tells us, the whole experience comes back to him:</p><p>the soothing rustle of the waves, and the saline smell\u2014boyhood's times, the clam digging, barefoot and with trowsers roll'd up\u2014the hay boat, and the chowder and fishing excursions; or, of later years, little voyages down and out New York bay, in the pilot boats.</p><p>From 1824 to 1828 Mr. Whitman's parents lived in Brooklyn. He remembers Lafayette's visit, and going to hear Elias Hicks preach in a ball-room on the Heights. He began life in earnest as an errand boy in a lawyer's office; subscribed to a circulating library; reveled in the Arabian Nights and Scott's novels and poems; and then went to work to learn the trade of a printer. When he was eighteen he was teaching school in Queens and Suffolk Counties, and 'boarding round.' Then was the time when it was his passion to sail the East River to and fro in the ferry boats, 'often up in the pilot-houses;' where he could 'get a full sweep, absorbing shows, accompaniments, surroundings.' To this succeeded a passion for Broadway and its omnibuses, where he saw Andrew Jackson, Webster, Clay, Seward, Van Buren, Walker the filibuster, Kossuth, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Bryant, the Prince of Wales, Dickens, and a host of other celebrities\u2014among them Cooper and Poe. One of his special reminiscences belonging to this time is this:</p><p>I once saw (it must have been about 1832, of a sharp bright January day) a bent, feeble, but stout-built very old man, bearded, swathed in rich furs, with a great ermine cap on his head, led and assisted, almost carried, down the steps of his high front stoop (a dozen friends and servants, emulous, carefully holding, guiding him) and then lifted and tuck'd in a gorgeous sleigh, envelop'd in other furs, for a ride\u2026I remember the spirited, champing horses, the driver with his whip, and a fellow driver by his side, for extra prudence\u2026It was John Jacob Astor.</p><p>In 1848-9 Mr. Whitman was editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle; then he went South, and worked at journalism a little while in New Orleans; then up into the Northwest and so round to New York again; then took to housebuilding and journalism once more in Brooklyn; and in 1855 began to put his Leaves of Grass to press. He was then in his thirty-sixth year.</p><p>The next sixty pages of the book are devoted to reminiscences of the Civil War, gathered in the Union hospitals among the sick and wounded soldiers. Mr. Whitman did good service as nurse and attendant in those trying days, and relates scores of pathetic incidents of the familiar type in unconventional terms. There is a powerful picture of the effect at Washington of the first Battle of Bull Run. There are graphic descriptions of field and camp hospitals, of trains and boat-loads of wounded, of individual cases of suffering, heroism, and patience, of visits to 'the front,' of death scenes, of Mr. Lincoln as he appeared on horseback with his cavalry escort, and, finally, a few concluding paragraphs under the forcible heading 'The real war will never get into the books.'</p><p>Having finished with the War, Mr. Whitman enters upon a range of bucolic themes, and shows himself to us as a sort of muscular Thoreau, fond of out-of-doors, of farm lanes, brooks and springs, bumble-bees, birds, and so on. He invites us to 'a July afternoon by the pond.' He teaches us 'the lesson of a tree.' He gives us a handful of 'autumn side-bits.' He spends 'a winter day on the beach.' He wanders out in the 'full-starr'd nights.' He takes a sun-bath, in sheer nakedness, in a secluded dell, once a marl-pit, 'now abandon'd, fill'd with bushes, trees, grass, a group of willows, a straggling bank, and a spring of delicious water running right through the middle of it, with two or three little cascades.' Look at this sturdy child of Nature playing with his mother:</p><p>Hanging clothes on a rail near by, keeping old broadbrim straw on head, and easy shoes on feet, haven't I had a good time the last two hours! First with the stiff-elastic bristles rasping arms, breast, sides, till they turn'd scarlet\u2014then partially bathing in the clear waters of the running brook\u2014taking everything very leisurely, with many rests and pauses\u2014stepping about barefooted every few minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze, for unctuous mud- baths to my feet\u2014a brief second and third rinsing in the crystal running waters\u2014rubbing with the fragrant towel\u2014slow negligent promenades on the turf up and down in the sun, varied with occasional rests\u2026Somehow I seem'd to get identity with each and every thing around me, in its condition. Nature was naked, and I was also.</p><p>Mingled with rambles and rambling meditations such as these are fragments of wider observations\u2014days on the Delaware, views and experiences in the South and the far West, notes on his visit to Boston a year or two since, and, among distinctively literary topics, paragraphs\u2014they are hardly more than that\u2014on Bryant, Emerson, Carlyle, and Longfellow. These finish the 'Specimen Days.'</p><p>The 'Collect' which follows opens with a long political and sociologic essay on 'Democratic Vistas.' The several prefaces to Leaves of Grass, 1855, 1872, 1876, succeed; then the North American Review paper on 'Poetry Today in America;' and finally a defense of Leaves of Grass from the charge of indecency, and a 'lecture' on the death of Lincoln.</p><p>As to Mr. Whitman's prose it is obviously quite interchangeable with his poetry. Many pages of this book might be transferred to Leaves of Grass by simply a rearrangement of lines. Thus (p. 109):</p><p>Cold and sharp last night\u2014<br>Clear and not much wind\u2014<br>The full moon shining, and a fine spread of constellations<br>and little and big stars\u2014<br>Sirius very bright, rising early,<br>Preceded by many-orb'd Orion, glittering, vast, sworded, <br>and chasing with his dog.</p><p>Or again (p. 132):</p><p>It was a happy thought to build the Hudson river railroad<br>right along the shore.<br>The grade is already made by nature;<br>You are sure of ventilation one side\u2014<br>And you are in nobody's way.<br>I see, hear, the locomotives and cars,<br>Rumbling, roaring, flaming, smoking,<br>Constantly, away off there, night and day\u2014<br>Less than a mile distant, and in full view by day.<br>I like both sight and sound.<br>Express trains thunder and lighten along;<br>Of freight trains, most of them very long,<br>There cannot be less than a hundred a day.</p><p>If this is not excellent poetry, measured by the Whitman standard, we are greatly mistaken. But, seriously, in his prose Mr. Whitman shows us a pleasanter side of himself than we have hitherto known.</p><p>\u2217Specimen Days and Collect. By Walt Whitman.

It is a miscellaneous gathering of his prose writings, early attempts, bits of letters, extracts from note-books and diaries, and what not,\u2014a pretty miscellaneous collection, without much connection except the author's personality, which looms up immensely through it, as it does through everything else he has written. The stories written while he was still in his teens are so melodramatic and unreal, that they would be unworthy of notice were it not for the premonitions they give of the author's powers. They have an intensity that almost reaches imagination, and they show also marked tendency to dwell upon the horrible. Out of nine tales seven are death-scenes, most of them with horrid accessories of cruelty and hate and lust. The melodramatic element in them belonged to his youth, and was entirely outgrown as his strength developed, but the brutal side of life has always retained a painful fascination for him. In the later writings in this volume he appears to much better advantage, notwithstanding their heterogeneousness. The passages about the civil war (he was in the hospitals through the greater part of the war) are very vivid, horribly so at times, with a fiery light like Carlyle's. The description of the death of Lincoln might have been a study for the 'French Revolution.' There is a milder description of Washington after the great defeat at Bull Run. </p> <p> He had naturally a warm appreciation of Carlyle, and writes well of him. Emerson is too good and too beautiful, with too little of the wild bull to satisfy him. Occasionally he is extremely unfortunate in his comments, as when he says that it is as a critic and not as a poet or artist or teacher that Emerson excels\u2014than which nothing could well be more erroneous. He had a keen appreciation of Carlyle's worship of force, and possessed his power of vivifying details, and even something of his style. He has a freshness and manly vigor that the dyspeptic Scotchman did not share. But he has shown none of the capacity for concentrated and prolonged effort that is essential for great work, and none of the aspiration for, or even conception of the ideal, which raises a work into art and made Carlyle a leader among men.

When he writes simply, forgetting himself and his responsibilities as the apostle of a new school, he is often very interesting, as notably in his accounts of hospital experience during the war. But he generally remembers himself pretty soon, and with the return to self-consciousness comes a certain straining after effect that is not always pleasant. Many passages have little but continuous typographical arrangement to distinguish them from his poetry. Here, for example, is a paragraph which we have divided into verses with other alteration.

No diary of an invalid is wholesomer reading than this; never a groan or a growl, never a word of complaint; but every bright hour, every breeze of health, every delight in flower and bird and stream and star, and in the kind voice or hand of a friend, remembered and recorded. Always, in this invalid's diary, the pure, fresh air, and the sky overhead; never the blinds drawn down, the table crowded with medicine bottles, and the foot of the spiritual medicine-man upon the threshold:</p> <p>'Doubtless in the course of the following, the fact of invalidism will crop out (I call myself a half-Paralytic these days, and reverently bless the Lord it is no worse) between some of the lines\u2014but I get my share of fun and healthy hours, and shall try to indicate them. (The trick is, I find, to tone your wants and tastes low down enough, and make much of negatives, and of mere daylight and the skies.)'</p> <p>From 1876, when Whitman began to get over the worst of the tedious and baffling illness, ascribed by physicians to his exertions in the hospitals during the war, he spent portions of several seasons at a secluded haunt in New Jersey\u2014Timber Creek, its stream (almost a river) entering from the great Delaware twelve miles away, 'with primitive solitudes, recluse and woody banks, sweet-feeding springs, and all the charms that birds, grass, wild-flowers, rabbits and squirrels, old oaks, walnut-trees, &c., can bring.' Down the long farm-lane he would hobble to a lonely pond, where the creek expands and the kingfishers dart and turn; and so, still sauntering on, 'to the spring under the willows\u2014musical as soft-clinking glasses\u2014pouring a sizeable stream, thick as my neck, pure and clear, out from its vent, where the bank arches over.' And here, enveloped for the month of May in the droning of bumble-bees, listening to the clear quailnotes in June, or the roulades and pensive refrains of the hermit-thrush, Whitman would take his seat on log or stump, and (the journalist's ruling passion strong in age and disablement) would jot down his notes\u2014notes not for the buoyant and healthy alone, but meant just as well for ailing folk:\u2014</p> <p>'Who knows (I have it in my fancy, my ambition) but the pages now ensuing may carry ray of sun, or smell of grass or corn, or call of bird, or gleam of stars by night, or snowflakes falling fresh and mystic, to denizen of heated city-house, or tired workman or workwoman?\u2014or may-be in sick room or prison\u2014to serve as cooling breeze, or Nature's aroma, to some fever'd mouth or latent pulse.'</p> <p>Sometimes he would run down by rail to the New Jersey sea-shore; and on those flat and odorous sea-prairies, their sedgy perfume in his nostrils, he would revive the sights and sounds and smells of his Long Island youth, the 'stretch of interminable white-brown sand, hard and smooth and broad, with the ocean perpetually, grandly rolling in upon it, with slow-measured sweep, with rustle and hiss and foam, and many a thump as of low bass drums.' Or, back again in his Camden home, he would cross and recross the Delaware, helped by the friendly pilots ('Eugene Crosby, with his strong, young arm so often supporting, circling, convoying me over the gaps of the bridge, through impediments, safely aboard'), and would enjoy the stir and play of the delightful 'human comedy,' or would invite his soul, and absorb the spectacle of the starry heavens.</p>  <p>'A January Night.\u2014Fine trips across the wide Delaware to-night. Tide pretty high, and a strong ebb. River, a little after eight, full of ice, mostly broken, but some large cakes making our strong-timber'd steamboat hum and quiver as she strikes them. In the clear moonlight they spread, strange, unearthly, silvery, faintly glistening, as far as I can see. Bumping, trembling, sometimes hissing like a thousand snakes, the tide-procession, as we wend with or through it, affording a grand undertone, in keeping with the scene. Overhead, the splendor indescribable; yet something haughty, almost supercilious, in the night. Never did I realise more latent sentiment, almost passion, in those silent interminable stars up there. One can understand, such a night, why, from the days of the Pharaohs or Job, the dome of heaven, sprinkled with planets, has supplied the subtlest, deepest criticism on human pride, glory, ambition.'</p> <p>We have record of visits to New York, and a sail in the bay, with a little lyrical cry at sight of the schooner-yachts going in a good wind\u2014'those daring, careening things of grace and wonder, those white and shaded swift-darting fish-birds (I wonder if sea or shore elsewhere can outvie them), ever with their slanting spars, and fierce, pure, hawk-like beauty and motion.' But the procession of gentility and wealth in Central Park is not altogether to Whitman's liking; and in his criticism of modern society, although at bottom he believes that the American people remains sound, there are pages (to quote Mr. Ruskin's words with respect to Whitman's writings) 'deadly true\u2014in the sense of rifles\u2014against our deadliest sins.' More than once Whitman voyaged up the Hudson to the honeysuckle-and-rose-embowered cottage of John Burroughs, the delightful writer of Wake Robin and Pepacton; and in September 1879 he found himself strong enough to begin a long jaunt to the West, seeing Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado, at Denver turning south, and then east again. The sea-like spread of prairies, the wild gorges, the streams of amber and bronze, brawling along their beds with frequent cascades and snow-white foam, the fantastic forms of mountains bathed in transparent browns, faint reds and grays, the free handling and absolute uncrampedness of the landscape, the superb physique of the miners, their character shaped by their victorious tussles with savage nature (but alas, the genteel ladies of the West, copying unsuccessfully their Eastern sisters!)\u2014these, with a few inevitable reserves, were all acceptable to, and accepted by, the author of Leaves of Grass. A later journey to Canada, the sight of Niagara, a visit to the hospitable house of his friend Dr. Bucke at London, then up the black waters of the Saguenay a hundred miles, the region more grim, more wildly beautiful, 'with a sort of still and pagan scaredness,' than any he had seen yet, comprised the last of Whitman's wanderings. A Sunday service with the insane at the asylum under the care of Dr. Bucke brought Whitman face to face with some of those 'laggards' in the race who have ever been dear to his heart:</p> <p>'I was furnish'd with an arm-chair near the pulpit, and sat facing the motley, yet perfectly well-behaved and orderly, congregation. The quaint dresses and bonnets of some of the women, several very old and gray, here and there like the heads in old pictures. O the looks that came from those faces! There were two or three I shall probably never forget. Nothing at all markedly repulsive or hideous\u2014strange enough I did not see one such. Our common humanity, mine and yours, everywhere\u2014</p> <p>'The same old blood\u2014the same red, running blood;' yet behind most, an inferr'd arriere of such storms, such wrecks, such mysteries, fires, love, wrong, greed for wealth, religious problems, crosses\u2014mirror'd from those crazed faces (yet now temporarily so calm, like still waters), all the woes and sad happenings of life and death\u2014now from everyone the devotional element radiating\u2014was it not, indeed, the peace of God that passeth all understanding, strange as it may sound?'</p> <p>Connected with the notes of convalescence in this volume are Whitman's previously published memoranda of the war; and the national frenzy and agony (with underlying sanity and strength) of the one period goes well with the tender calm and restorative happiness of the other. His lecture on Lincoln, a record of his visits to Emerson and Longfellow, a reminiscence and a criticism, severe, yet sympathetic, of Edgar Poe, will interest readers who care to see great or distinguished persons through a poet's eyes. At Emerson's grave he muses:</p><p>'A just man, poised on himself, all-loving, all-inclosing, and sane and clear as the sun. Nor does it seem so much Emerson himself we are here to honor\u2014it is conscience, simplicity, culture, humanity's attributes at their best, yet applicable, if need be, to average affairs\u2026How shall I henceforth dwell on the blessed hours when, not long since, I saw that benignant face, the clear eyes, the silently smiling mouth, the form yet upright in its great age\u2014to the very last, with so much spring and cheeriness, and such an absence of decrepitude, that even the term venerable hardly seemed fitting?'</p> <p>The tribute is made of more worth by Whitman's keen perception of the limita- tions of Emerson's genius. Elsewhere there is eloquent recognition of the work done for American literature by Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier. I miss from this collection of notes an admirable piece of criticism on Burns, published in Our Land and Time (January 25, 1875). In Edgar Poe, Whitman finds neither the genius for perfect and noble living and thinking, morally without flaw, happily balanced in activity, nor 'that other shape of personality dearer far to the artist-sense (which likes the strongest play of lights and shades) where the perfect character, the good, the heroic, although never attain'd, it never lost sight of, but through failures, sorrows, temporary downfalls, is return'd to again and again' (so with Burns, Byron, George Sand):</p> <p>'Almost without the first sign of moral principle, or of the concrete and its heroisms, or the simpler affections of the heart, Poe's verses illustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty, with the rhyming art to ex- cess, an incorrigible propensity towards nocturnal themes, a demoniac undertone behind every page\u2014and, by final judgment, belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature, brilliant and dazzling, but with no heat\u2026In a dream I once had, I saw a vessel on the sea, at midnight, in a storm. It was no great full-rigg'd ship, nor majestic steamer, steering firmly through the gale, but seem'd one of those superb little schooner-yachts I had so often seen lying anchor'd, rocking so jauntily in the waters around New York, or up Long Island Sound\u2014now flying uncontroll'd with torn sails and broken spars through the wild sleet, and winds and waves of the night. On the deck was a slender, slight, beautiful figure, a dim man, apparently enjoying all the terror, the murk, and the dislocation of which he was the centre and the victim. That figure of my lurid dream might stand for Edgar Poe, his spirit, his fortunes, and his poems -themselves all lurid dreams.'</p> <p>Beside 'Democratic Vistas,' known to all who value Whitman, this volume contains the recent articles by him in the North American Review ('Poetry to-day in America' and 'A Memorandum at a Venture'), the prefaces to the several editions of his poems, and some pieces written in early youth\u2014short tales and poems\u2014printed now to avoid the annoyance of a surreptitious issue which had been announced.</p> <p>Among other restoratives of health one could wish that Whitman would some time try a voyage across the Atlantic. With Mr. Tennyson, Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Rossetti, Mr. Symonds, Mr. Swinburne, Mr. W. Bell Scott, Mr. R. Hengist Horne, Mr. Robert Buchanan, Mr. Robert L. Stevenson, the Hon. Roden Noel, and others known and unknown, desirous to give him friendly greeting, he might have among us, in American phrase, 'a good time.</p> <p>EDWARD DOWDEN.</p>", "date": "November 18 1882", "year": 1882, "creator": "Edward Dowden", "publication": "The Academy", "citation": "Dowden, Edward. \"[Review of Specimen Days and Collect].\" 18 November 1882.

Philadelphia: Rees, Walsh, & Co. $2.</p> <p>IN our issue for March 21st 1882, we drew attention to the then recently published English edition of Walt Whitman's volume of Poems, 'Leaves of Grass.' The writer of that notice felt bound to hail Whitman as the poet who beyond all others was imbued with, and gave expression to, the Modern Spirit. The chants in the 'Leaves of Grass' convey, in a form as beautiful as it is original, the universal wonder and sympathy which fill the mind of a poet who cares not so much to speculate upon the mysterious future as 'to loafe' and enjoy the more mysterious present. The problems of existence have a subordinate place in his regard: the fact of existence is the consummate object of his thoughts. Remarkable as are his poems for their originality, their strength, and their beauty, the volume of prose now before us exceeds them in each of these attributes. Not to many poets is given to be great prose writers. Probably Victor Hugo alone of all the writers in this century has achieved supreme excellence in both. We may incur the charge of exaggeration, especially from those whose sympathies in this matter we are not entitled to expect; but we are inclined to trust posterity to endorse the verdict, that Walt Whitman is one of the very greatest writers in prose and poetry which the nineteenth century has produced. The theory that genius is still inspired has new confirmation in his works. Isaiah and Jeremiah, in the 'broadsheets' in which they rebuked their Jewish fellow- countrymen for the hollowness of their worship and for their social sins, were not more trenchant than this modern prophet, who denounces the shams of an age more civilized but probably more corrupt than theirs. 'Is there,' says Whitman, 'a great moral and religious civilization\u2014the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infidelity.'</p> <p>The first writings of Carlyle and Emerson were despised and rejected; and yet these very writings have had so profound an influence in forming the thought of our period, that it were impossible to imagine, as Whitman remarks, what it would have been without them. The mantle of Carlyle has in a sense fallen upon Whitman. Without Carlyle's historic sense, without his bitter personal irony, he has all Carlyle's contempt for humbug, all his withering scorn of the respectabilities, all his earnestness and enthusiasm for the true democracy. Less a man of books, more a man of men,\u2014less a recluse, more a man of the world,\u2014than either Carlyle or Emerson, he adds new point to their texts, and finds new sermons in them. Learned, Whitman certainly is\u2014a man of vast reading, fulfilled more than most students with what is to be had from books. He is more. His immense pliability of intellect, his subtle power of fixing his gaze with intimate scrutiny, enable him to absorb suggestions from everything. He reads a man\u2014the very spinal marrow of him\u2014not as an anatomist or a psychologist, or a man of business or a tailor, but as they all would do. The separate, special individuality: that seizes Whitman's attention\u2014and he has the man. Thus, he examines the individual, and through him the aggregate. Society, its foibles, its rottenness, is transparent to him, and he does not spare it. While he is one of the most powerful advocates of the rights of the democracy, he never ceases to urge the necessity of its making private and public virtue as much an aim as political power. With the grasp of a true seer, he never sighs for 'the old days that are ended,' but attempts to urge on a future richer than any past in strong men and women, 'in crops of fine youths and majestic old persons.' The means he purposes using, and advocating the use of, are not legislative\u2014they are intellectual. 'Of all this, and these lamentable conditions,' he says, in continuation of [the] passage quoted above, 'to breathe into them the breath recuperative of sane and heroic life, I say a new-founded literature, not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces, or to pander to what is called good taste, not only to amuse, pass away time, celebrate the beautiful, the refined, the past, or exhibit technical, rhythmic, or grammatical dexterity, but a literature underlying life, religious, consistent with science, handling the elements and forces with competent power, teaching and training men\u2014and, perhaps the most precious of its results\u2014achieving the entire redemption of women out of these incredible holds and webs of silliness, millinery and every kind of dyspeptic depletion, and thus ensuring to the States a strong and sweet Female Race\u2014a race of Perfect Mothers\u2014is what is needed.'</p> <p>In 'Democratic Vistas' he expounds his political philosophy more consecutively and eloquently than anywhere else:\u2014</p> <p>'The political history of the past may be summed up as having grown out of what underlies the words, order, safety, caste, and especially out of the need of some prompt deciding authority, and of cohesion at all cost. Leaping time, we come to the period within the memory of people now living, when, as from some lair where they had slumbered long, accumulating wrath, sprang up and are yet active (1790, and on even to the present, 1870), those noisy eructations, destructive iconoclasms, a fierce sense of wrongs, amid which moves the power [sic], well known in modern history, in the Old World, stain'd with much blood, and marked by savage reactionary clamors and demands. These bear mostly as on one inclosing point of need. For after the rest is said\u2014after the many time-honor'd and really true things for subordination, experience, right of property, &c., have been listen'd to and acquiesced in\u2014after the valuable and well-settled statement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conn'd over and exhausted\u2014it remains to bring forward and modify everything else with the idea of that Something a Man is, (last precious consolation of the drudging poor,) standing apart from all else, divine in his own right, and a woman in hers, sole and untouchable by any canons of authority, or any rule derived from precedent, state-safety, the acts of legislatures, or even from what is called religion, modesty, or art. The radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant doings of our immediately preceding three centuries, and has been the political genesis and life of America. Advancing visibly, it still more advances invisibly. Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of society, as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations of the world, we see steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself, even in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation, this image of completeness in separatism, of individual personal dignity, of a single person, either male or female, characterized in the main, not from extrinsic acquirements or position, but in the pride of himself or herself alone; and, as an eventual conclusion and summing up (or else the entire scheme of things is aimless, a cheat, a crash), the simple idea that the last, best dependence is to be upon humanity itself, and its own inherent, normal, full-grown qualities, without any superstitious support whatever.'</p> <p>'The purpose of democracy\u2014supplanting old belief in the necessary absoluteness of establish'd dynastic ruleship, temporal, ecclesiastical, and scholastic, as furnishing the only security against chaos, crime, and ignorance\u2014is, through many transmigrations, and amid endless ridicules, arguments, and ostensible failures, to illustrate, at all hazards, this doctrine or theory that man, properly trained in sanest, highest freedom, may and must become a law, and series of laws, unto himself, surrounding and providing for, not only his own personal control, but all his relations to other individuals, and to the state; and that, while other theories, as in the past histories of nations have proved wise enough, and indispensable perhaps for their conditions, this, as matters now stand in our civilized world, is the only scheme worth working from, as warranting results like those of Nature's laws, reliable, when once establish'd, to carry on themselves.'</p> <p>'Literature, strictly considered, has never recognized the People, and whatever may be said does not to-day. Speaking generally, the tendencies of literature, as hitherto pursued, have been to make mostly critical and querulous men. It seems as if, so far, there were some natural repugnance between a literary and professional life, and the rude rank spirit of democracies. There is in later literature, a treatment of benevolence, a charity business, rife enough it is true; but I know nothing more rare, even in this country, than a fit scientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People\u2014of their measureless wealth of latent power and capacity, their vast, artistic contrasts of lights and shades\u2014with, in America, their entire reliability in emergencies, and a certain breadth of historic grandeur, of peace or war, far surpassing all the vaunted samples of book-heroes, or any haut ton coteries, in all the records of the world.'</p> <p>'To formulate beyond this present vagueness\u2014to help, live, and put before us the species, or specimen of the species of the democratic ethnology of the future, is a work toward which the genius of our land, with peculiar encouragement, invites her well-wishers. Already certain limnings, more or less grotesque, more or less fading and watery, have appeared. We, too (repressing doubts and qualms), will try our hand. Attempting then, however crudely, a basic model or portrait of personality for general use for the manliness of the States\u2014and doubtless that is most useful which is most simple and comprehensive for all, and toned low enough\u2014we should prepare the canvas well beforehand. Parentage must consider itself in advance\u2026To our model a clear-blooded, strong-fibered physique is indispensable; the questions of food, drink, air, exercise, assimilation, digestion, can never be intermitted. Out of these we decry a well-begotten self-hood\u2014in youth fresh, ardent, emotional, aspiring, full of adventure; at maturity brave, perceptive, under control, neither too talkative nor too reticent, neither flippant nor somber; of the bodily figure the movements easy, the complexion showing the best blood, somewhat flushed, breast expanded, an erect attitude, a voice whose sound outvies music, eyes of calm and steady gaze, yet capable of flashing, and a general presence that holds its own in the company of the highest, for it is native personality, and that alone, that endows a man to stand before presidents or generals, or in any distinguished collection with aplomb, and not culture or any knowledge or intellect whatever.'</p> <p>A large part of the volume is occupied by Whitman's diary during the American War. Some of the sketches were written as letters to friends during the war and afterwards. All of them have the same nervous strength. They are, indeed, as he says, 'a batch of convulsively written reminiscences.' Why should they not? 'They are but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke, and excitement of those times. The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it, can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness.' We can only give two of these sketches:\u2014</p><p><strong>'THREE YEARS SUMM'D UP.</strong></p><p>'During those three years in hospital, camp, or field, I made over six hundred visits or tours, and went, as I estimate, counting all, among from eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick, as sustainer of spirit and body in some degree, in time of need. These visits varied from an hour or two, to all day or night; for with dear or critical cases I generally watch'd all night. Sometimes I took up my quarters in the hospital, and slept or watch'd there several nights in succession. Those three years I consider the greatest privilege and satisfaction, (with all their feverish excitements and physical deprivations and lamentable sights,) and, of course, the most profound lesson of my life.'</p><p><strong>'THE MILLION DEAD, TOO, SUMM'D UP.</strong></p><p>'The dead in this war, there they lie, strewing the fields, and woods, and valleys, and battlefields of the South\u2014Virginia, the Peninsula, Malvern Hill and Fair Oaks, the banks of the Chickahominy, the terraces of Fredericks- burgh, Antietam Bridge, the grisly ravines of Manassas, the bloody pro- menade of the Wilderness; the varieties of the strayed dead; Gettysburgh, the West, Southwest; Vicksburgh, Chattanooga, the trenches of Petersburgh; the numberless battles, camps, hospitals everywhere; the crop reap'd by the mighty reapers, and typhoid, dysentery, inflammations, and blackest and loathsomest of all, the dead and living burial-pits, the prison- pens of Andersonville, Salisbury, Belle-Isle, &c.

Philadelphia: Rees, Welsh & Co.</p> <p>The whole of Walt Whitman's prose writing is included in this closely printed book. So much has been said upon Whitman's place in literature, judgment upon his worth is so various and confused\u2014Prof. Dowden, for instance, associates him with Shakespeare, and a recent commentator of American literature whistles him confidently down the wind to nothingness\u2014that his own expression and elucidation of himself must be regarded with peculiar interest by large numbers of readers. The new book is certainly not wanting in versatility. It contains many of those brief, sketchily written notes on nature which were, it is apparent, jotted down in the open air, amid the freshness of fields and woods and streams; it contains the celebrated 'Democratic Vistas,' which tell of the politics, progress, and nationality of our Western world; and it includes, above all, those widely discussed prefaces, touching upon American poetry to-day, and especially upon the future of American poetry, as this is viewed by Whitman. At the end of the book there is a series of 'notes left over,' and there are reprinted some of the author's early work in prose and verse. Persons who are inspired by the cosmic exultation in Leaves of Grass should not fail to compare those radical poems with the poet's manner and thought in the verses called 'Dough-Face Song,' and in a highly moral tale like 'Death in a Schoolroom.' These early pieces are, it must be seen, not worth reprinting; and Whitman has set them, it is clear, in a somewhat frank spirit of defiance. It has often been stated by his critics that his youthful work was essentially mediocre and imitative, and that he changed his manner in order that he might be accounted an original poet; but Whitman takes the tenable ground, evidently, that he has outgrown his first work and has moved forward progressively. He believes that he can afford to compare Leaves of Grass and Specimen Days with the labor of his green literary years.</p> <p>As to Whitman's prose manner\u2014the manner which may be described as his style\u2014that is found to be, throughout this book, a kind of cultivated affectation, not at all forcible because it is unconventional. It is an obscure, involved, harsh manner, frequently ungrammatical and cumbersome: seldom graceful, direct, or simple. It is best when it is most free from the writer's word-torturings. Occasionally Whitman throws off his affectations and composes with straightforward lucidity; the fact that he can do this and does it proves conclusively that he depends for one sort of effect upon literary eccentricity and trickery. It is probable, however, that he has faith to some degree in his own tricks. On the other hand, it may be said of him that he can rise to the dignity of a large subject, as in the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass. He has, moreover, a certain mastery of picturesque word- painting, which finds an abundant, vigorous outlet in his works on nature. His prose, taken altogether, is not especially distinguishable from his verse\u2014if, indeed, he can be said to have written verse. The constant use which he makes of the hyphen amounts to his fashion of breaking phrases and sentences in 'Leaves of Grass.'</p> <p>The picturesqueness and the imaginative feeling, also the spirit of broad human tenderness, which are felt in the notes will, one is apt to think, win the attention of many readers who cannot find their way through the extravagance and garrulity of Whitman's verse; in spite of the fact, too, that his verse has, in a crude state, sound poetic qualities and robustly original conceptions. It is far less what Whitman writes that stirs many observant men than what he sees or suggests. His conceptions of mankind, of present nationality, of the real earth and the world, are vital to the imagination. He is not, it is discovered by thinkers who are abreast of the science of our time, a sentimental idealist. He does not regard longingly the world as it was or as it might be. He is not blind to the thousand and one facts of life to which, seemingly, poets are densely blind. He views broadly, radically, the evolution of man, of nature, and of society. It is his stand-point which is his strong point. His force, his purpose, is new in literature. A poet who searches so deep and high could hardly fail to gain his adherents. It is because Whitman is so little of an artist, because he is a rhapsodist rather than a poet, that he misses his mark with the bulk of readers. Nevertheless, he is more tempered in his prose. The condensation of prose appears to hold him in check. His notes might be read with delight\u2014by one grown accustomed to his spasmodic style\u2014under the open sky. Many of his descriptions charm the fancy. He speaks of 'the beautiful, spiritual insects;' of the 'rising and falling wind-purr from the tops of the maples and willows;' of 'the indolent and spiritual night, inexpressibly rich, tender, suggestive;' of 'the monotone and liquid gurgle from the hoarse, sumptuous, copious fall;' of 'the flap of a pike leaping out and rippling the water;' of 'the guttural twittering' of the kingfishers; of bumble-bees 'humming their perpetual rich mellow boom;' and one might quote a long list of still happier phrases. The following note, placed at the end of some war reminiscences, is quite characteristic of Whitman, and exhibits his tendency to dwell on words, no matter how awkwardly he may employ his language: 'As I have looked over the proof-sheets of the preceding pages, I have once or twice feared that my diary would prove at best but a batch of convulsively written reminiscences. Well, be it so. They are but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke, and excitement of those times. The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it, can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness.' It should be mentioned that Whitman's reminiscences of the civil war are honest, pathetic comments upon serious, at times tragic, episodes. Whitman knows what the war days were; he has felt their horror and mournfulness; and he writes about them with a sincere candor which cannot be confounded with his usual strain for effect. In his prose notes, as in his patriotic chants, his voice is sure and tender. Some of the most imaginative and also realistic of his notes are inspired by night, with all its stars and infinite distances, with its strange and solemn silence, with its universal beauty. He describes, for example, the emotion which is aroused in him by a Winter night: 'I don't know anything more thrilling than to be on the wide firm deck of a powerful boat, a clear, cool, extra moonlight night, crushing proudly and resistlessly through this thick, marbly, glistening ice. The whole river is now spread with it\u2014some immense cakes. There is such weirdness about the scene - partly the quality of the light, with its tinge of blue, the lunar twilight\u2014only the large stars holding their own in the radiance of the moon. Temperature sharp, comfortable for motion, dry, full of oxygen. But the sense of power\u2014the steady, scornful, imperious urge of our strong new engine, as she plows her way through the big and little cakes.' In this brief paragraph there may be found that stalwartism of sense and soul which is so enthusiastically admired by the Whitman men, and which is, without doubt, an impressive trait in the poet.</p> <p>Whitman's notes are not confined to war, reminiscences and descriptions; he gives in a few of them his opinions of certain men and his views upon various subjects. He writes upon the death of Carlyle, upon Carlyle from an American point of view, upon his visit to Boston, upon four American poets\u2014Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, and Emerson. He rebukes a magazine critic who attacked him for his 'attitude of contempt and scorn and intolerance' toward our leading poets. He says: 'I can't imagine any better luck befalling these States for a poetical beginning and initiation than has come from Emerson, Longfellow, Bryant, and Whittier.' Emerson, he thinks, stands at the head of the four. He is at a loss to give precedence to either of the others. His description of them is flattering, not to put too fine a point upon it: 'Each illustrious, each rounded, each distinctive.' Emerson, he thinks, is noteworthy for his sweet, vital-tasting melody, rhymed philosophy, and amber-clear poems; Longfellow for rich color, graceful forms, and incidents, a competitor with the singers of Europe on their own ground; Bryant for pulsing the first interior verse-throbs of a mighty world; Whittier for the zeal, the moral energy that founded New-England. One can hardly assert hereafter that Whitman, the least satisfactory and the most original of all our poets, rejects and condemns the body corporate of American poets. It is unfortunate in the circumstances, that he has not presented his views upon more eminent American verse-writers, like Lowell, Stedman, Aldrich, Stoddard, and a few others. It is invariably pleasant to read the opinions, of poets upon poets. In one of his notes concerning Emerson, Whitman refers to the philosopher's condemnation\u2014from a strict standpoint of morality\u2014of that rather notorious and thoroughly objectionable poem, 'Children of Adam.' According to Emerson and most fine-sighted critics, the immorality of this poem is repulsive. Emerson argued on the subject with Whitman, who was not convinced. When Emerson asked him what he had to say in reply to arguments, Whitman\u2014who is his own reporter here\u2014said: 'Only that while I can't answer them at all, I feel more settled than ever to adhere to my own theory and exemplify it.' The question is, then, between Whitman and the public taste, and we believe that public taste will decide it sharply. If Whitman's theory of morality, which is, briefly, that everything can be uttered honestly in literature, should be accepted, there would no longer be any mystery in social relation, no charm of modesty in sexual intercourse. It is interesting, however, to read Whitman's opinion upon the question at first hand.</p> <p>There is some strong, practical writing in 'Democratic Vistas,' though the majority of persons who take up this book will turn their attention at once to the prefaces, all of them curious contributions to literature and more generally discussed than known. In the preface of 1855, which has aroused the most attentive consideration in England and throughout Europe, Whitman makes several aggressive assumptions. He asserts in the beginning that the Americans, of all the people of the earth, have the fullest poetical nature; that the United States are themselves a great poem. He declares, furthermore, that the American poets\u2014meaning, of course, the poets of the future\u2014are to inclose old and new, since ours is the race of races; they shall excite generosity and affection; they shall be cosmos. The boldest statement in this preface is the following radicalism: 'Exact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest poet, but always his encouragement and support.' In the preface of 1872 Whitman adds eloquently: 'The mighty present age! To absorb and express in poetry anything of it\u2014of its world\u2014America\u2014cities and States\u2014the years, the events of our nineteenth century\u2014the rapidity of movement\u2014the violent contrasts, fluctuations of light and shade, of hope and fear\u2014the entire revolution made by science in the poetic method\u2014these great new underlying facts and ideas rushing and spreading everywhere\u2014truly a mighty age.' Again, in the preface of 1876, he says: 'I count with such absolute certainty on the great future of the United States\u2014different from, though founded on, the past\u2014that I have always invoked that future, and surrounded myself with it, before or while singing my songs.' At the end of his article on 'Poetry To-day in America,' Whitman writes prophetically: 'Meanwhile, Democracy waits, the coming of its bards in silence and twilight\u2014but 'tis the twilight of the dawn.'</p> <p>It is clear that Whitman's aspiration is noble and liberal, that his faith is founded in the history of humanity, and that his prophecy is the right prophecy of this 'mighty age'\u2014mighty and wonderful though a hundred Ruskins, though a thousand Carlyles had launched their invective against its penetrating power.

It is not an English word, nor is it Americanized, according to the standard dictionaries; yet Mr. Whitman has made it good American, so far as in his power lies, and stamped it with more than ordinary significance. Ensemble. What does Walt Whitman mean by that pet word? He brings it in at the oddest moments. It is one of many (such as, for instance, Libertad, clair-obscure, laying-off, barbaric yawp, arrieres, melange, and twenty more) at sight of which, judicious critics educated at universities and suckled on Matthew Arnold and John Ruskin, are seen to be affected by a peculiar spasm of the features that leaves no doubt concerning their views on such additions to the language. Whatever the rights in the case may be, whatever sense there is in tying down the English language to words that have their patents from the old masters, this word is of such importance in examining understandingly the prose and poetry of Whitman, that it alone would be a fitting inscription to his monument. It is a word without legal status, an innovation, a piece of piracy from the French\u2014an awkward word, if the truth must be told. And yet it signifies more than any other the striving which gives the work of Whitman its chief value, its main grandeur. A Democratic Prometheus, Walt Whitman has been battling during most of his literary career against the complacent Jupiter of conventional, popular literature. His chains have been poverty, contempt, shallowness of critics, bad taste on his own side. He has been a failure; even now he is not a success; but every decade of the century will show more clearly that his failure is better than the successes of Longfellow and Tennyson. The selection of the word Ensemble is not the happiest; but he has made it, and it should be respected for the great idea, let us say the grand failure, that lies behind it.</p> <p>What has impressed Whitman most during his intimate comradeship with Long Island farming folk, New York workmen and roughs, New Jersey 'mudsills,' and the thousands of soldiers belonging to every state of the Union, and both parties to the Civil War, whom he came in personal contact with in the Capital of the country? It is size, quantity, greatness, mass, extent. He sees everything on the biggest scale. A reader of palms who reads his books will assert beforehand that he has broad, long and thick hands, with fingers thick and shorter than those of most people. He sees in everything the big masses, not the little particulars. Hence his love for the gigantic; the tremendous impression crowds, armies, the terrible wastes, the sublime prairies of the West, make on his peculiar individuality. Hence his early discarding of the ordinary forms of versification, and his molding out of the prose of Carlyle, and the prose and poetry of Victor Hugo, a new literary form of expression, which is all that its enthusiastic admirers claim for it, although not always equally successful, and more than any one could have expected, looking merely at Whitman's chances in life. It is only half knowledge that demands absolute originality; for that is something which does not, can not exist. So far as is humanly possible, Whitman is an original poet, representative in literature of a great fact, and, like all such representatives, harder for those to estimate who are near by than those at a distance. For the present, he is a poet for poets and connoisseurs; the people neglect him utterly for men who follow the traditions; woman, the half of humanity which holds to old ideas most tenaciously for good or for evil, rejects him, chiefly because in his gigantic wrestling with the impossible in literature he offends her by writing of things which modesty conceals, but also because woman looks backward instead of forward, and so prevents a too rapid advance over ground not thoroughly discussed and proved. Now what is the task Whitman -half aware of it, half unaware\u2014has grappled with? It is to sing the 'Ensemble,' the whole\u2014everything! He is the painter who, unchastened by failures in the studio, rushes out into the fields and tries to paint a panorama of the whole horizon. Nothing shall be lacking. The microcosm must yield its nudities and sexual impulses, its pangs of agony at being unable to describe the indescribable, its delight in sounds made by human art, its overflow of affection and tenderness toward man, woman and child. The macrocosm must be depicted in the effects on man of its cosmic forces, of the sun and stars, of night and dawn, and effects of fog, haze, atmosphere. The effort made by all this striving must be painful to some sensitive natures; certainly in 'Leaves of Grass' and in a hundred passages of this collection under a still queerer name, the struggle beats through in a magnificent, chaotic fashion, which eventually masses itself into something like order, and now discovers to the patient and sympathetic reader that here is the reign of law.</p> <p>Ensemble is Whitman's strength and his weakness. He fails magnificently, where a better instructed man, or a cautious, would have remained fatally mediocre. It is curious to find in his case, as in many others here, that so far from having no ancestry, Whitman can read back through a line of sturdy, fairly-taught yeomen, to dates which are very often unattainable by Europeans who make such things their greatest boast. He has a good deal of Dutch blood, and his predilection for adaptations of French words may mean that he has some of the old French Protestant blood which did more to form New York in Dutch times than the historians are yet prepared to tell. His fearlessly egotistical account of his derivation and life will be just what readers of 'Leaves of Grass' have wanted, for it throws the strongest light on the origin and meaning of that work. Patriotic people, who are not utterly at odds with Whitman, will be glad to find further notes taken during his hospital work at Washington. THE CRITIC might be half filled with passages deserving quotation. The recent Western and Canadian notes show his healthy and big views of things in nature; they are fine, but tantalising in their shortness. What Whitman has to say about Carlyle and Emerson was too recently published (in these pages) to need present notice, and so were 'The Poetry of the Future' and 'A Memorandum at a Venture' (in The North American). Many pieces in 'Specimen Days' appeared in this paper. The most curious in the 'Collect' are poetical pieces printed long ago in New York papers, before Whitman broke with ordinary verse restrictions, and carved out for himself the elastic system of poetry-prose, in which 'Leaves of Grass' appeared. That poem and this volume of essays and notes form in themselves a literary inter-state exhibition or American Institute Fair, such as Whitman has attempted to describe in measures. Every sort of thing is crammed into it, and the manager is the big, good-natured, shrewd and large-souled poet, whose photograph shows him lounging in smoking-jacket and broad felt hat, gazing at his hand, on which a delicate butterfly, with expanded wings, forms a contrast to the thick fin-gers and heavy ploughman's wrist.</p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p> <p>\u2217 Specimen Days and Collect By Walt Whitman.

The volume opens with an account of the parentage and ancestry of the author.</p> <p>'The later years of the last century,' he tells us, 'found the Van Velsor family, my mother's side, living on their own farm at Cold Spring, Long Island, New York State, near the edge of Queen's County, about a mile from the harbour. My father's side\u2014probably the fifth generation from the first English arrivals in New England\u2014were at the same time farmers on their own land (and a fine domain it was, 500 acres, all good soil, gently sloping east and south, about one-tenth woods, plenty of grand old trees), two or three miles off, at West Hills, Suffolk County.'</p> <p>Next we have some reminiscences of Whitman's early life on Long Island, and afterwards at Brooklyn, where he attended the public schools, and began life in a lawyer's office. Two years later he went to work in a weekly newspaper and printing office to learn the trade. Of his amusements and tastes during this period we have many interesting details. His first subscription to a circulating library, when the 'Arabian Nights,' and Sir Walter Scott's novels, and after that his poems, laid the foundation of a taste for the reading of romances and poetry which he retains to this day. The theatre, too, he delighted in, and saw all the great actors and singers, American or European, in their most celebrated r\u00f4les. We hear, too, of his passion for ferries. In his youthful years at New York and Brooklyn, his life was, he says,</p> <p>'curiously identified with Fulton ferry, already becoming the greatest of its sort in the world for general importance, volume, variety, rapidity, and picturesqueness. Almost daily, later ('50 to '60) I crossed on the boats, often up in the pilot houses, where I could get a full sweep, absorbing shows, accompaniments, surroundings. What oceanic currents, eddies, underneath the great tide of humanity also, with ever-shifting movements! Indeed, I have always had a passion for ferries; to me they afford inimitable, streaming, never-failing poems.'</p> <p>The Broadway sights, too, impressed him vividly. 'Here I saw during these times Andrew Jackson, Webster, Clay, Seward, Martin Van Buren, fillibuster Walker, Kossuth, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Bryant, the Prince of Wales, Charles Dickens, the first Japanese ambassadors, and lots of other celebrities of the time.' In 1848-9 he was editor of a Brooklyn newspaper, The Daily Eagle. In 1855 he sent to press Leaves of Grass, being then in his thirty-sixth year. In 1862 [sic] the Secession War broke out. Walt Whitman immediately abandoned his editorial and other avocations, and devoted himself during the whole continuance of the struggle to ministering to the sick and wounded in the military hospitals, living for the most part at Washington, and making occasional visits to the front. The scenes which came under his notice at this period are most vividly described in the present volume, and seem, as was but natural, to have left a profound and overwhelming impression on him, stirring his nature to the very depths, and exalting and intensifying his patriotic and democratic sentiments. He even sees in the steadiness in action of American soldiers, and their heroic fortitude under wounds and sickness, a triumphant argument in favour of democracy; forgetting or ignoring that these same military virtues have been displayed by European troops in various ages, and under every form of government. Two facts concerning the Secession War deserve notice, as being in direct contradiction of the usually received opinion on the matter in England. First, we have it, on Mr. Whitman's testimony as an eye-witness, that an immense majority, quite nine out of ten, of the combatants on the side of the North were native Americans. Second, there were in the Northern army men from every State in the Union, without exception. Not one of the revolted States but had its contingent fighting under the Union flag. In a speech in the House of Representatives, April 15, 1879, Mr. Garfield said, 'Do gentlemen know that (leaving out all the border States) there were fifty regiments and seven companies of white men in our army fighting for the Union, from the States that went into rebellion?' After the close of the war our author remained for some years in Washington, employed in the attorney-general's department.</p> <p>'In February, 1873,' he tells us, 'I was stricken down by paralysis, gave up my desk, and emigrated to Camden, New Jersey, where I lived during 1874 and 1875, quite unwell, but after that began to grow better; commenced going for weeks at a time, even for months, down in the country, to a charmingly recluse and rural spot along Timber Creek, twelve or thirteen miles from where it enters the Delaware river. Domiciled in the farm-house of my friends, the Staffords, near by, I lived half the time along the creek and its adjacent fields and lanes. And it is to my life here that I, perhaps, owe partial recovery (a sort of second wind, or semi-renewal of the lease of life) from the prostration of 1874 and 1875.'</p> <p>We may add, that it was not alone to the influences thus alluded to that this partial recovery was due, but in no small degree to the poet's own energy, good sense, and cheerful patience. Gallantly he has fought for his life, disputing the ground inch by inch, never yielding to impatience or discouragement, delighting in the joys still left him, and, as the homely proverb has it, 'cutting his coat according to his cloth.' Amid the notes on external Nature, on the songs and habits of birds, on the trees, the skies, the stars, of which a great part of the volume is composed, so rare and slight is the mention of his infirmities that we might forget that the idyll was composed by a half-paralyzed man, were it not for such an entry as the following:\u2014</p> <p>'September 5, 1877.\u2014I write this, 11 a.m., sheltered under a dense oak by the bank, where I have taken refuge from a sudden rain. I came down here (we had sulky drizzles all the morning, but an hour ago a lull) for the before-mentioned daily and simple exercise I am fond of to pull on that young hickory sapling out there\u2014to sway and yield to its tough-limber upright stem\u2014haply to get into my old sinews some of its elastic fibre and clear sap. I stand on the turf and take these health-pulls moderately, and at intervals, for nearly an hour, inhaling great draughts of fresh air. Wandering by the creek, I have three or four naturally favourable spots where I rest besides a chair I lug with me and use for more deliberate occasions. At other spots I have selected, besides the hickory just named, long and limber boughs of beech or holly, in easy-reaching distance, for my natural gymnasia for arms, chest, trunk-muscles. I can feel the sap and sinew rising through me, like mercury to heat. I hold on boughs or slender trees caressingly there, in the sun and shade; wrestle with their innocent stalwartness, and know the virtue thereof passes from them into me\u2014or maybe we interchange; maybe the trees are more aware of it all than I ever thought.'</p> <p>There is much in Specimen Days which we should like to quote, if our space permitted but little, comparatively, which calls for comment. The thought is often highly poetic, and always wholesome and unconventional. The form in which it is expressed is more open to criticism. At page 268 he says:\u2014'Nothing is better than simplicity; nothing can make up for excess, or lack of definiteness.' Now the want of definiteness is often painfully felt in his own style, while there is much of excess and redundancy. His sentences often read like lists of substantives; and both simplicity and definiteness are too often sacrificed to this heaping up of words, apparently with the view of more fully expressing something which after all remains obscure and intangible. Under the head of 'Democratic Vistas' (p. 257), he gives us his idea of the literary style of the future:\u2014</p> <p>'Not merely the pedagogue forms\u2014correct, regular, familiar with precedent, made for matters of outside propriety, fine words, thoughts definitely told out\u2014but a language formed by the breath of Nature, which leaps overhead, cares mostly for impetus and effects, and for what it plants and invigorates to grow\u2014tallies life and character, and seldomer tells a thing than suggests or necessitates it.'</p> <p>We conclude that Specimen Days are also a specimen of this new and especially democratic style. If so, we are not ripe for it, for it is, to us, the one great drawback to the book. Many of Whitman's criticisms on contemporary literature, society, and morals, in America, are very striking and original, showing great insight and considerable power of generalization; but their philosophical value is greatly lessened by his allowing his democratic enthusiasm to overspread the whole field of thought. For him it seems as though everything fell under one of two categories\u2014democratic or feudal. Democracy, too, seems to him to exist nowhere but in America. Another very noticeable feature in his philosophizing is, that so much\u2014nearly everything good or desirable\u2014is in the future. He is perpetually violating the wise injunction of his countryman Artemus Ward:1 'Never prophesy, unless you know.' Thus he paints the present state of American morality, political, commercial, and social, with quite as black a brush as did the author of 'Democracy.' 'If I were asked,' he says (p. 233), 'to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread, respecting the America of our hopes, I should point to this particular'\u2014that is, the absence of 'the primary moral element.' But this is to be remedied in the future, bien entendu, by an 'all-penetrating religiousness.' But it is to be a democratic religion, apparently, without churches or religious machinery, for he elsewhere prophesies that before another century is past there will be no more priests. Will not the religious world be somewhat like an army without officers? In the future, too, and likely to be so for an indefinite period, is the American annexation of Canada, which the great prophet of democracy no less confidently predicts. But in a future more remote and dim than all the rest, is the 'race of orbic bards, sweet democratic despots of the West,' so eloquently apostrophized at page 241, and more fully described at page 253:\u2014</p> <p>'In the future of these States must arise Poets immenser far, and make great poems of death. The poems of life are great; but there must be the poems of the purpose of life, not only in itself, but beyond itself. I have eulogized Homer, the sacred bards of Jewry, \u00c6schylus, Juvenal, Shakespeare, &c., and acknowledged their inestimable value. But (with perhaps the exception in some, not in all respects, of the second mentioned) I say there must, for future and democratic purposes, appear poets (dare I say so?) of higher class even than any of those\u2014poets, not only possessed of the religious fire and abandon of Isaiah, luxuriant in the epic talent of Homer, or for proud characters as in Shakespeare, but consistent with the Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science.'The appearance of such poets as these, especially a class of such poets, can hardly be confidently expected; yet on this apparently remote contingency, the continued existence and greatness of the United States (we are elsewhere told) depends. Walt Whitman's critical remarks on the writings of Edgar Po\u00eb are well worth reading, as are also his criticisms on Carlyle and on Tennyson, but they are too long to quote. His remarks on British literature generally are not so happy; there is too much affectation of treating it as something foreign and alien. Here, as elsewhere, his id\u00e9e fixe, democracy, warps his judgment; his patriotism runs away with him. He claims for America as close kinship with the literatures of Italy, France, Spain, &c., as with that of England, yet na\u00efvely avows their foreignness by wishing there existed better English translations of them. There is much truth in his strictures (page 231) on modern culture:\u2014</p> <p>'As now taught, accepted, and carried out, are not the processes of culture rapidly creating a class of supercilious infidels who believe in nothing? Shall a man lose himself in countless masses of adjustments; and be so shaped in reference to this, and that, and the other, that the simply good and healthy and brave parts of him are reduced and clipped away, like the bordering of box in a garden? You can cultivate corn and roses and orchards\u2014but who shall cultivate the mountain peaks, the ocean, or the tumbling gorgeousness of the clouds?'</p> <p>His judgment of Darwin's 'Theory of Evolution' is insufficient and unsatisfactory. Probably the new idea reached him too late in life, when his mind had already taken too decided a bent to be fully penetrated and imbued by a new theory of the universe. He evidently regrets the old legends of man's descent from gods or demigods, and falls into the common error of supposing that Darwin makes man the descendant of apes and baboons. For his own part (p. 326), Whitman thinks\u2014'the problem of origins, human and other, is not the least whit nearer its solution. In due time the evolution theory will have to abate its vehemence, cannot be allowed to dominate everything else, and will have to take its place as a segment of the circle, the cluster\u2014as but one of many theories, many thoughts, of profoundest value\u2014and readjusting and differentiating much, yet leaving the divine secrets just as inexplicable and unreachable as before\u2014maybe more so.'</p> <p>Evidently he has not taken in that the theory of evolution is not an ingenious word-system, like the metaphysical speculations of Kant or Hegel, but the discovery of a great natural law, like that of gravitation, dominating every form of life just as inevitably as gravitation reigns over matter. He does not see that man himself is but a small and fleeting phase of evolution, and his systems, religious and political, but the phases of a phase. One more quotation must close this notice, which our sense of the importance of the work under consideration has led us to extend to an undue length. In speaking of Protection (p. 332), Whitman asks the pertinent question: 'Who gets the plunder?' 'It would,' he says, 'be some excuse and satisfaction if even a fair proportion of it went to the masses of labouring men, resulting in homesteads to such men, women and children\u2014myriads of actual homes in fee simple in every State . . . . . But the Act is nothing of the kind. Theprofits of 'protection' go altogether to a few score select persons, who, by favours of Congress, State legislatures, the banks, and other special advantages, are forming a vulgar aristocracy, full as bad as anything in the British or European castes of blood, or the dynasties of the past.'</p> <p>'Specimen Days and Collect.'

That Mr. Swinburne should have been moved to eulogy of Whitman's 'poems' is natural enough. There is an old proverb about the gregariousness of birds of similar plumage which goes far to explain it, and we can understand how it is that many of the less cultivated of Whitman's compatriots should be won over by his gorgeous anticipations of the 'fruitage' of American democracy; but that Emerson and Mr. Ruskin, to mention no others, should be found quoted in the advertisement of his book has long puzzled us. Mr. Ruskin is reported to have said that 'it carries straight and keen as rifle-balls against our deadliest social sins;' Emerson wrote that it is 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' And besides those and several other eminent authorities, there are not a few of our younger writers who regard Whitman as the great poet of democracy and the pioneer of a new literary era. According to the accepted canons of criticism and taste\u2014canons to which the best minds of the best epochs of civilisation have successively added, or from which they have subtracted\u2014we should have expected that the greater part of Whitman's 'poems' would be set down as mere egotistical mouthing of sentiments either trite or untrue, sometimes deliberately nasty, and exhibiting very few traces of the inner qualities or external characteristics of true poetry. What, then, is the explanation of the admiration and eulogy which they have provoked? It seems to us to lie in the following considerations. In his essay On Liberty, Mill says that in an age of conformity 'exceptional individuals, instead of being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the mass. In other times, there was no advantage in their doing so, unless they acted not only differently, but better. In this age, the mere example of non-conformity, the mere refusal to bow the knee to custom, is itself a service.' A half-unconscious conviction to this effect exists in most men; we often feel that we conform too much, although we see no point at which we had better cease to conform. There is a feeling of individualism, of self-assertion,\u2014of manliness, if you like,\u2014prompting a moment's sympathy with men or causes which reason immediately shows to be unworthy of it. It is hardly too much to say that for the first moment of thought upon a new subject\u2014the Promethean moment\u2014every man is a Radical. Defiance of established custom, though it may soon be seen to be mistaken and misleading, is, for the moment, a grateful testimony to the fundamental independence of our common nature. And the more closely any matter is confined within strict rules and customs, the more sure is any abrupt departure from these to secure a temporary approval and admiration. Now, in no field of modern thought is custom more imperious than in literature, and in no branch of modern literature is the tendency to lay down and follow strict rules so strong as in poetry. When, therefore, a writer appears, styling himself 'poet,' utterly defying and ridiculing all our rules and customs, he is almost certain to find a temporary circle of admirers who will exaggerate his merits and glorify his defects. This has been the case with Whitman. He comes with the latest version of the old heroic command, 'Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee;' and so at first men overlook all his defects and his emptiness,\u2014they forget that they still find their daily spiritual and intellectual satisfaction in the long-accepted singers of mankind,\u2014while the innate Radicalism of human nature is leading them to offer him a generous welcome.</p> <p>The volume before us contains Whitman's complete prose works. The edition of Messrs. Wilson and McCormick is apparently printed from the same plates as the American edition, but upon better paper, with wider margins, and is therefore pleasanter to read. We may add, by the way, that the publication of Whitman's works by a Philadelphia house is doubtless accounted for by the fact that the Attorney-General of Massachusetts informed Messrs. Osgood and Co., Whitman's Boston publishers, that the issue of a second edition of Leaves of Grass would be followed by a prosecution for publishing obscene literature. Part of the present prose has appeared before in his books, part in the magazines, and part in the newspapers,\u2014hence the title 'Collect'\u2014and the rest, consisting chiefly of items of autobiography, is now printed for the first time. 'Specimen Days' occupy more than half the volume, and these are described as 'a huddle of diary jottings, war-memoranda of 1862-65, Nature-notes of 1877-81, with Western and Canadian observations afterwards.' They average about half a page each, and are impromptu, unrevised, bits of description or reflection 'pencil'd' (or sometimes 'pencill'd'), about any person, place, or thing to which the author 'feels to devote a memorandum,' falling for the most part under the three heads of himself, nature, and literature. The following 'day' will give the reader an adequate idea of Whitman's descriptions of Nature; his days are joined each to each in natural common- place, and to have read half-a-dozen is to have read them all.</p><p><strong>'A HINT OF WILD NATURE.</strong></p><p>'As I was crossing the Delaware to-day, saw a large flock of wild geese, right overhead, not very high up, ranged in V-shape, in relief against the noon clouds of light smoke-color. Had a capital though momentary view of them, and then of their course on and on southeast, till gradually fading\u2014(my eyesight yet first-rate for the open air and its distances, but I use glasses for reading.) Queer thoughts melted into me the two or three minutes or less, seeing these creatures cleaving the sky\u2014the spacious, airy realm\u2014even the prevailing smoke-gray color everywhere, (no sun shining)\u2014the waters below\u2014the rapid flight of the birds, appearing just for a minute\u2014flashing to me such a hint of the whole spread of Nature, with her eternal unsophisticated freshness, her never-visited recesses of sea, sky, shore\u2014and then disappearing in the distance.'</p> <p>One quality, however, saves this passage from being pure common-place, viz., its egotism, which makes it offensive. It is a fair specimen of the assurance with which the author sets forth trite reflections, dressed up in a sledge-hammer style, and constantly interrupted by triv-ial personal parentheses. Here is a typical example of Whitman's literary criticisms, exhibiting the same characteristics. It is typical, we should add, in every respect but one,\u2014in this instance, the reader can discover a definite meaning on the part of the author:\u2014</p> <p>'There is, apart from mere intellect, in the make-up of every superior human identity, (in its moral completeness, considered as ensemble, not for that moral alone, but for the whole being, including physique,) a wondrous something that realises without argument, frequently without what is called education, (though I think it the goal and apex of all education deserving the name)\u2014an intuition of the absolute balance, in space and time, of the whole of this multifarious, mad chaos of fraud, frivolity, hoggishness,\u2014this revel of fools, and incredible make-believe and general unsettledness we call the world; a soul-sight of that divine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of things, all history and time, and all events, however trivial, however momentous, like a leash'd dog in the hand of the hunter. Such soul-sight and root-centre for the mind\u2014mere optimism explains only the surface or fringe of it\u2014Carlyle was mostly, perhaps entirely without.'</p> <p>In this grandiloquent and verbose passage there is, at any rate, a very familiar idea to be found; but we have to confess that after careful reading we were unable to detect any definite meaning in the majority of Whitman's literary statements and prophecies, even in the cases where he puts a plain question, and professes to give a direct answer. As this may result from our inability to grasp the stupendous forecasts likely to be made by a man who calmly informs us that he found the Rocky Mountains to be the law of his own poems, we will leave our readers to judge between author and critic in a test case. Toward the end of Democratic Vistas (of which, by the way, we made a careful epitome, in a fruitless effort to follow the author's reasoning), Whitman says:\u2014'Repeating our inquiry, what, then, do we mean by real literature? especially the democratic literature of the future?' This is admirably clear and to the point, but hardly has he asked the question before he begins to shuffle out of an answer to it. 'Hard questions to meet,' he goes on to say, and every succeeding clause takes us further from the point. 'The clues are inferential, and turn us to the past. At best, we can only offer suggestions, comparisons, circuits.' Then follows a page and a half of really eloquent tribute to the literature of the past, and an apostrophe to its great representatives:\u2014</p> <p>'Unknown Egyptians, graving hieroglyphs; Hindus, with hymn and apothegm and endless epic; Hebrew prophet, with spirituality, as in flashes of lightning; Christ, with bent head, brooding peace and love, like a dove; Greek, creating eternal shapes of physical and \u2018sthetic proportion; Roman, lord of satire, the sword, and the codex.'</p> <p>This is good in itself, but the 'circuit' is leading us further and further from the answer to the plain question with which the author started. When at length the answer does come, it is as follows (and who will interpret it for us?):\u2014</p> <p>'Ye powerful and resplendent ones! ye were, in your atmospheres, grown not for America, but rather for her foes, the feudal and the old\u2014while our genius is democratic and modern. Yet could ye, indeed, but breathe your breath of life into our New World's nostrils\u2014not to enslave us, as now, but, for our needs, to breed a spirit like your own\u2014perhaps, (dare we to say it?) to dominate, even destroy, what you yourselves have left! On your plane, and no less, but even higher and wider, must we mete and measure for to-day and here. I demand races of orbic bards, with unconditional uncompromising away. Come forth, sweet democratic despots of the west!</p> <p>By points like these, we, in reflection, token what we mean by any land's or people's genuine literature.'</p> <p>In the regretted absence of the sweet democratic despots of the west, we should have been grateful if a little more simple meaning had come forth from the many pages of discourse like the above, which duty has compelled us to peruse. Mr. Stevenson, in his charming eulogistic essay, says, 'Whitman is too clever to slip into a succinct formula;' we think it would be truer to say that he is far too unenlightened.</p> <p>Taken as a whole, however, this volume shows its author in a pleasanter light than is shed upon him by his 'poems.' The personal element in it is more modest, less vulgar; there are passages of considerable power and original insight, although in most cases his descriptions still depend for their effect more upon a catalogue-like exhaustive enumeration, than upon selective acumen; and he is occasionally very happy in his epithets. But the most interesting parts of the book are those in which he really has something to tell; his reminiscences of the war and his description of the assassination of Lincoln are worth more than all his literary prophecies and political rhapsodies put together. These 'war memoranda' suggest one rather unpleasant question; he seems to have done good service in visiting the hospitals and purveying small comforts to the wounded, but when we read his enthusiastic account of the young Union soldiers who faced death so simply and bravely, and bore their fearful sufferings and neglect without a word of complaint, it gives us rather a shock to find him saying immediately afterwards, 'During the war I possessed the perfection of physical health,' and, 'There has lately been much suffering here from heat; I go around with an umbrella and a fan.' We cannot help asking what would have become of the Union if many men in the perfection of physical health had contented themselves with an umbrella and a fan and 'diary-jottings,' instead of shouldering a musket and giving their lives in silence. And while we freely admit the merits we have mentioned, the examination of this volume has confirmed us in our conviction of the absence of any real and permanent significance in Whitman's writings. It is difficult to escape the belief that much of them has been produced with a view to effect. A man who was thoroughly actuated by the principles of democratic independence professed by Whitman would hardly have taken from a private letter of Emerson the over-generous words, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career,' and have flaunted them upon the cover of his book. Occasionally he does give us what he terms 'a radical utterance out of the emotions and the physique,'\u2014a phrase intense in its expression, an idea startling in its originality and scope, an exhortation or an appeal powerful in its personal directness, but this is all.</p> <p>But, in the first place, Whitman is ignorant: this book, with its scrawled title-age, furnishes abundant evidence that its author knows next to nothing of many things which he unhesitatingly exalts or denounces, and that he has no adequate conception of many of the problems he so confidently solves. He declares his determination to get 'away from ligatures, tight boots, buttons, and the whole cast-iron civilized life;' he will have 'no talk, no bonds, no dress, no books, no manners;' he tells us that Grant's life 'transcends Plutarch,' that 'it was a happy thought to build the Hudson River railroad right along the shore,' (what deadly social sin will Mr. Ruskin think that statement carries against?) that 'the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry,' that 'the Muse of the Prairies, of California, Canada, Texas, and of the peaks of Colorado\u2026soars to the freer, vaster diviner heaven of prose.' What rubbish all this is! His grammar is constantly faulty, and much more so in his later works than in his earlier ones,\u2014a suspicious inversion of the general rule. Why should any sane man prevent even his proof-reader from correcting blunders like 'I do not know as,' . . .? Unless, too, the reader possesses considerable familiarity with American slang, he will frequently be stopped by such expressions as 'fetching up,' 'scooted,' 'derring-do,' 'out of kilter.' But the English language, even when supplemented by the most forcible slang in the world, is still unequal to the expression of this man's thoughts, so that he is compelled to employ a large original vocabulary, e.g., 'jetted,' 'gaggery,' 'compaction,' 'outcroppage,' 'literatus,' 'ostent,' 'philosoph,' 'to promulge,' and 'memorandize.' Even in his own name he perpetuates what was doubtless his familiar title among his fellow-compositors on the old Long Island Patriot. Moreover, just as his one successful lyrical poem, 'My Captain,' is enough to disprove all his theories of poetry, so we have noticed a curious slip, which, though small in itself, still tends to show that his outspokenness is an affectation rather than a genuine impulse. In describing the scene of wild excitement that followed the assassination of Lincoln, he says that the soldiers of the President's guard charged the audience in the theatre, shouting, ' Clear out! clear out! you sons of\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2026' Think of this for a moment: 'no bonds, no mannerisms, no fossil-etiquettes,' and then,\u2014'you sons of\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2026' Why, even Shakespeare, whom Whitman calls the 'tally of feudalism,' 'offensive to democracy,' or Tennyson, 'lush-ripening,' and 'quite sophisticated,' would have ventured to write 'Hell.'</p> <p>Whitman's second prominent characteristic is animalism, using the word in no specially bad sense. Not to renew an old and unpleasant controversy, we will let the statement pass that he has not written anything which is not pure in its intention although whatever the author's intention may have been, the intention of his American publisher is indicated by the announcement that the new edition of Leaves of Grass 'contains every page, every line, every word attempted to be officially suppressed by the Massachusetts authorities.' We will content ourselves with describing his characteristic as animalism\u2014the emphatic expression of the simply animal side of human nature. His works simply raise again, with greater vehemence, perhaps, but with the same shallow views, the once famous cry, 'Retourner \u00e0 la nature!' If to sit naked on a gate in the sunshine, rubbing oneself scarlet with a flesh-brush\u2014a process of which this volume contains a detailed account\u2014were in any way symbolic of human life, then Whitman would be our proper teacher. But as far as this 'al fresco physiology' is from being such a symbol, so far is Walt Whitman from holding such a position. And we have nothing to lose in discarding him; for all the radicalism, the love of truth, the independence, the faith in men, in democracy, and in America, which his admirers discover in him, is to be found in Emerson in purer, saner, higher form.</p> <p>Specimen Days and Collect By Walt Whitman, Author of 'Leaves of Grass.'

BUCKE, M.D. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>IN a letter dated Concord, 6th May, 1856, Emerson wrote to Carlyle:\u2014'One book, last summer, came out in New York, a nondescript monster which yet has terrible eyes and buffalo strength, and was indisputably American, which I thought to send you, but the book throve so badly with the few to whom I shewed it, and wanted good morals so much, that I never dxml:id. Yet I believe now again I shall. It is called Leaves of Grass, was written and printed by a journeyman printer in Brooklyn, New York, named Walter Whitman; and after you have looked into it, if you think, as you may, that it is only an auctioneer's inventory, you can light your pipe with it.'</p><p>The book referred to was a copy of the singular looking thin quarto volume of little more than a hundred pages, in which the Leaves of Grass originally appeared, and which is now so eagerly sought after by American book-collectors. What Carlyle's opinion of it was, whether, as Emerson thought he might, he used it for the purpose of lighting his pipe, or like Emerson, he held it in high esteem for its intrinsic excellence, we have no means of knowing. In the recently published Carlyle-Emerson correspondence there is no further reference to it, and so far as we can remember, no allusion is made to it in any of Carlyle's published writing.</p><p>The reception which this strange 'nondescript monster['] with 'terrible eyes and buffalo strength' met with at the hands of the public and in literary circles was almost as disheartening as possible. Of the thousand copies printed, some, Dr. Bucke informs us, were given away, most of them were lost, abandoned, or destroyed.\u2217 According to Mr. Burroughs, some sixty copies were deposited for sale in a bookseller's shop in Brooklyn, and as many more in another in New York. Weeks elapsed and not a single copy was sold. Presently there came the request from both the booksellers that the unfortunate thin quarto should be removed. Subsequently the copies found refuge in the warehouse of a phrenological publishing establishment in Broadway, the proprietors of which advertised the work, and sent out copies for review and to distinguished persons. 'The journals,' continues Mr. Burroughs, 'remained silent, and of the copies sent to distinguished persons several were returned with insulting notes. The only reception heard of, was such, for instance, as the use of the volume by the attaches of a leading daily paper in New York\u2014collected in a swarm Saturday afternoon, waiting to be paxml:id off\u2014as a butt and burlesque, whose perusal aloud by one of the party, the other lounging or standing about, was equivalent to peals upon peals of ironical laughter from the whole assemblage.\u2020 Cold as its reception by the press was, it was scarcely so silent, however, as Mr. Burroughs' words might lead the reader to suppose. As we learn from Dr. Bucke's extremely useful and handy little volume, it was noticed, though certainly in no very complimentary terms, in the Brooklyn Daily Times, in the London Critic, and in the New York Criterion. Nor was it altogether ignored in higher quarters. It had the honour of being reviewed in Putnam's Magazine, then the most influential and best conducted of the American periodicals. The reception given to it there was probably under the circumstances the best possible. The reviewer filled three columns with extracts from its pages, selecting the most original and striking passages, and passing over those which were calculated to offend, and though he pronounced the new poems to be a 'mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism,' which were here 'seen to combine in harmony,' and indulged in other pleasantries of a similar nature, he frankly acknowledged that there were to be found 'an original perception of nature, a manly temper, and an epic directness in the new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school.'</p> <p>That any warmer or more encouraging reception should have been accorded to the book was scarcely to be expected. Its singular appearance, its peculiar lines, its utter want of conformity with most of the conventionalities of the poet's art, the obscurity of its author, and above all its seeming want of good morals were against it. Circumstances, however, soon conspired to lift both the volume and its author, if not out of derision, at least out of obscurity. The first and most weighty was the publication of a letter to Whitman from Emerson in which he declared the Leaves of Grass a 'wonderful gift,' and pronounced it 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' 'I give you joy,' he wrote with his usual cheeriness, 'of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things saxml:id incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.    .   .   .  The solxml:id sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Thoreau wrote of the book in a similar, if more guarded, strain. 'On the whole, it sounds to me,' were his words, 'very brave and American, after whatever deductions. I do not believe that all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in this land, put together, are equal to it for preaching. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He sometimes suggests something a little more than human.' By these and other means public attention was gradually directed to the volume: and when at length a new and enlarged edition appeared in 1856, it awoke a perfect storm of derision and abuse. Indeed, so extreme were the feelings it excited, that, according to Dr. Bucke, a number of persons in New York seriously contemplated instituting proceedings against its author in the courts of law, and were only deterred by the consxml:ideration that, whatever might be the estimation in which his book deserved to be held, Whitman himself was so popular in New York and Brooklyn that it would be impossible to get a jury to find him guilty. But the best piece of good luck that befell Whitman was his dismissal in 1865, by Mr. Harlan, formerly a Wesleyan clergyman, but at the time secretary for the Interior, from a government clerkship he had obtained, on the ground of the alleged immorality of Leaves of Grass. This act at once put the climax to the discussion as to his merits and demerits, and aroused an intense curiosity respecting his volume, and not a little sympathy in his favour.</p> <p>On Whitman himself the derision and abuse, which were heaped upon him in true Philistine fashion, had, and have had, little or no permanent effect. Least of all, have they induced him to modify the principles with which he started on his literary career, which, as Emerson rightly divined, 'had a long foreground.' Having carefully settled his principles at the beginning, Whitman has steadily adhered to them, never doubting, and never having the slightest misgivings as to their soundness. Respecting the matter in which he has applied them\u2014a very different thing\u2014he has now and again had serious doubts.</p> <p>'Since I have been ill,' he writes in a note to the Preface of 1876, 'I have felt temporary depression more than once, for fear that in Leaves of Grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced.' But in his clearest and calmest moods he has always realized, he tells us, that as the Leaves surely prepare the way for morals and necessitate them, and are adjusted to them just as nature does and is, so they are what, consistently with his plan, they must and should be. The scorn which he naturally felt towards his detractors was mainly of the silent sort. He neither sought to defend his reputation, nor to retaliate on those by whom it was so savagely assailed; nor dxml:id he care much whether he was understood or not. In a poem which does not seem to have been included in the earliest edition, and which is in some respects characteristic, he writes:\u2014</p> <p>'I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or to be understood;<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise;<br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all),</p> <p>'I exist as I am\u2014that is enough:<br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;<br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content;</p> <p>'One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;<br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million<br>years,<br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p> <p>'My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution;<br>And I know the amplitude of time.'</p> <p>This bold and almost arrogant confxml:idence is now apparently being justified. Though not popular in the sense that he is wxml:idely read, or that his works are to be found, as Whittier's are saxml:id to be, in almost every house in the United States, Whitman has on the American continent a large and increasing circle of readers. Outsxml:ide of America his admirers are more numerous still. Like Fourier, he may be saxml:id to have his propagandists in many lands. On the continent of Europe some of his works have been translated into several languages, while in England, where his worth was early recognised, he has secured the warm, and on the whole judicious advocacy of poets and critics like Swinburne, Buchanan, W.B. Bell, W.M. Rossetti, Symonds, and Professor Dowden, and of his popularity amongst ourselves not the least significant sign is the publication of the two handsome volumes, the titles of which we have placed first at the head of this paper.</p> <p>In these volumes is contained, it would appear, all that Whitman desires to be preserved of his published writings. The one bearing the title Specimen Days and Collect is, with the exception of one or two juvenile pieces, in prose, and as the title indicates, is of very varied contents. First of all, we have a number of pages in which Whitman gives an account\u2014an account, we may remark in passing, which is not without interest\u2014of his ancestry and early days. Next, we have a number of memoranda written during the war of attempted secession, and here copied verbatim from a series of 'soil'd and creas'd livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket,' and 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain,' having been 'hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom admit the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march.' The memoranda here given from these 'lurxml:id and blood-smutch'd little note-books' bear all the marks of their origin. They are written in swift, vigorous, telling words; while the intense realism by which they are pervaded, and the terrible scenes which they depict, often make their reading exceedingly impressive. Following these, and forming the concluding part of the Specimen Days, is a number of memoranda written during and after the author's recovery from a serious and prolonged illness, brought on by his exertions during the war, and consisting, for the most part, of descriptions of natural and human scenes. They are full of fine thought and feeling, and are frequently not less poetical than some of the finer passages in his poems. In the Collect are included the remarkable essay entitled 'Democratic Vistas,' the prefaces to the various issues of his poems, and a paper on 'American Poetry.'</p> <p>Whitman's prose is, in our opinion, not equal to his verse. Passages of great beauty and power occur; but taken as a whole the style is less terse and vigorous. It is marred, too, by mannerisms, and particularly by the frequent occurrence of long and often clumsy parentheses. As a rule the shorter pieces are written in much sounder and healthier English than the longer, though some of these are admirably written, and lead one to suspect, as a not unfriendly critic has observed, 'that his every-day prose is distorted intentionally.' For a right understanding of Whitman's poetry, however, a careful study of his prose writings, and more especially of the section having the somewhat strange, though not all together inappropriate, designation of 'Collect,' is indispensable. It is here that he explains himself, and unfolds the aims and principles by which he is guxml:ided and inspired.</p> <p>Leaves of Grass, originally, as we have remarked, a thin quarto of about a hundred pages, has now grown into a goodly sized octavo of nearly four hundred closely printed pages, containing close upon three hundred separate poems. Whitman has given regular titles to comparatively few of them. Most of them are headed instead with their first line or phrase, as, e.g. 'As I pondered in silence,' 'I hear America singing,' 'When I heard at the close of the day.' The greater part of them are distributed under the headings\u2014'Inscriptions,' 'Children of Adam,' 'Calamus,' 'Birds of Passage,' 'Sea-drift,' 'By the Roadsxml:ide,' 'Drum-taps,' 'Autumn Rivulets,' 'Whispers of Heavenly Death,' 'From Noon to Starry Eye,' 'Songs of Parting.' Unconnected as they seem, however, it must not be supposed that they have no connection or are without arrangement. Though without formal connection, they have one which is real, and are intended to be read in the order in which they stand, as what may not unfitly be called an Epic of Life. On first reading, as most readers will probably acknowledge, they are somewhat repellent. There is so much in them we do not expect to find, so little respect is paxml:id to our conventional xml:ideas, and the author obtrudes himself so ostentatiously upon our attention, that after a few lines, we are disposed to throw the book asxml:ide as a compound of egotism and nonsense. On further reading, however, the illusion is gradually dispelled. First the attention is arrested by single lines or isolated passages, and as we proceed we become aware of an intellectual wealth and suggestiveness, a subtle charm, a personal force, a rush and glow of overmastering passion which we have seldom met with elsewhere; and though there are passages from which we turn away with repugnance, we cease to wonder at the warm and extremely eulogistic terms in which the admirers of Whitman are in the habit of speaking of him.</p> <p>But whatever our estimate of Whitman's writings may be, Whitman himself is unquestionably a notable figure, certainly one of the most notable America has produced. As Professor Dowden has remarked,\u2014'What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass, is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-word clay nor cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timxml:idly from behind his work to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am, a solxml:id and not inconsxml:iderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications; he attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love: or our extreme repugnance. However we feel toward him we cannot despise him. He is a 'summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be gotten rxml:id of. Passed by he cannot be.'\u2021 Nor are the sources of this singular power far to seek. They are to be found not so much in his art, for as an artist he is in some respects confessedly weak, but in the lofty purpose by which he is inspired, and in the ardent, and almost fierce enthusiasm with which he has from first to last devoted himself to it. This purpose, to put it in the fewest words, is nothing less than to inaugurate in America, by means of a genuinely native imaginative literature, a new era of intellectual and spiritual development. Or to put it differently, and to use the eloquent words of W. M. Rossetti, he 'occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one\u2014a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the continent, or the Washington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America.' This purpose is surely a noble one, and which, if at all seriously followed, cannot fail to be fruitful in extraordinary power. And that this is the purpose which Whitman has continually set before him he has frequently declared. 'Democratic Vistas,' his various Prefaces, and several other of his prose essays may be taken as a sort of apology justifying it. But, nowhere has he given more noble utterance to it, as Mr. Rossetti has also pointed out, than in the following lines:\u2014</p> <p>'Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,<br>I will make the most splendxml:id race the sun ever shone upon,<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades,<br>'I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America,<br>and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,I will make inseparable cities with their arms around each other's necks,<br>By the love of comrades<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>'For you, these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!<br>For you, for you, I am trilling these songs.'</p> <p>Besxml:ides an 'imperious conviction and the commands of his nature as total and as irresistible as those which make the sea flow, or the globe revolve,' Whitman's incentives to this great and unquestionably beneficent task are partly in the condition of American society, and partly in the character of American literature.</p> <p>The spectacle presented by American society he describes as 'appalling.' Everywhere he sees hollowness, hypocrisy, deceit; in the business classes a depravity 'infinitely greater than has been supposed;' 'corruption, falsehood, and maladministration in branches and departments of the official services, whether national, state, or municipal;' in 'fashionable life flippancy, tepxml:id armours, weak infxml:idelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time;' 'in literature a scornful superciliousness;' 'in the churches and sects the most dismal phantasms usurping the name of religion.' 'The best class we shew,' he writes, 'is but a mob of fashionably-dress'd speculators and vulgarians.' Though an unwavering believer in democracy, and joyfully recognising the 'immense success of the New World democracy in lifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain species of intellectual culture,' he is nevertheless painfully oppressed by the conviction that so far 'in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, esthetic results, it is almost a complete failure,' 'in vain, he exclaims, 'do we march with unprecedented strxml:ides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annexed Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north to Canada and south to Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.' Or take the following passage from the 'Democratic Vistas,' which, while it illustrates his style in prose writing, clearly indicates one at least of the reasons why he has devoted himself to his self-imposed task:\u2014</p> <p>'Let me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations, localities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition. After an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bays, sparkling sea txml:ides, costly and lofty new buildings, facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich ships, the wharves, the great Central Park and the Brooklyn Park of hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)\u2014the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters\u2014these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my sense of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the east and north rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in the Wall Street, or the Gold Exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas\u2014but in the artificial, the work of man, too, is equally great\u2014in this profusion of teeming humanity\u2014in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships\u2014these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p> <p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real importance, personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask\u2014Are there, indeed, men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Is there a great moral and religious civilization\u2014the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infxml:idelity\u2014everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe\u2014everywhere an abnormal libxml:idinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood decreasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (consxml:idering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p> <p>Turning to the literature of America, any 'breath recuperative of sane and heroic life' to breathe into these lamentable conditions, Whitman nowhere finds. That which he observes to be everywhere lacking is native or original power. Workers in a certain sort of literature he sees in abundance; but 'touched by the national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality, they wither,' he affirms, 'to ashes.' 'I have not seen,' he remarks, 'a single writer, artist, lecturer, or what not, that has confronted the voiceless, but ever erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the land, in a spirit kindred to itself.' And, again, 'consxml:idered with reference to purposes of patriotism, health, and noble personality, religion, and the democratic adjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic plays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of our best xml:ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish no one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no one, and suffice only the lowest levels of vacant minds.' Morally and artistically, he affirms, America has as yet originated nothing. 'We see the sons and daughters of the New World,' he observes, 'ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the universal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and the dead. We see London, Paris, Italy\u2014not original, superb, as where they belong, but secondhand here, where they do not belong. We see the shreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks, but where on her own soil do we see, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.' The central point of a nation, and that whence it is swayed and sways others, that which consolxml:idates its various parts, and is the source at once of its inspiration and influence, is, he believes, its national literature, and more especially its archetypal poems, but any such literature or poems America, he maintains, does not possess.</p> <p>What then is the literature he desires and to what extent has he realised this desire in his own works? The answer to the first of these questions the foregoing paragraphs have already suggested. Those who wish for a fuller and more explicit answer we must refer to Specimen Days and Collect, and more especially to the 'Democratic Vistas,' the Prefaces of 1855 and 1876, and to the essay on 'Poetry To-day in America\u2014Shakespeare\u2014The Future,' where Whitman has unfolded his xml:ideas at consxml:iderable length, and frequently with great eloquence and power. In the space now remaining at our disposal we shall point out one or two of the features of the literature he has produced, premising, however, that many of the questions we shall be obliged to pass over in silence.</p> <p>Whitman's principle defect, as a poet, lies, as it seems to us, and as we have already saxml:id, in the direction of his artistic power. That which strikes the reader first on opening Leaves of Grass is the singular appearance of its pages. The ordinary forms of versification Whitman has discarded, and adopted in their stead one which reminds us of Ossian, the writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the Vedas. By his thorough-paced admirers this is claimed as a sign of originality and strength. In our opinion, it is a sign of weakness. A really great poet, one, that is, who is thoroughly perfect in all the branches of his art, is a master of expression. Whitman confessedly is not. After many trials he was forced, he tells us, to give up the attempt to express himself in the forms employed by the great poets of the principal literary nations, and to use the mode he has here adopted. There is running through his works, as Mr. Rossetti has very truly remarked, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical movement and a sustained melody which are admirable, as for example\u2014'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,' 'O Captain, my Captain,' 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed.' These, however, are exceptions. Generally speaking, Whitman's lines are deficient in melody. Music of a certain kind they certainly have; but they want the measured cadence, the flowing melody, that exquisite rhythmical charm which makes the words of the great poets take hold of the mind and live in the memory as the sweetest strain of a noble song. Nor can it be saxml:id that by adopting this peculiar mode of versification Whitman has secured any advantages superior to those afforded by the ordinary forms. That he has obtained a greater freedom may probably be admitted; but it is questionable whether it is not at the expense of effectiveness. To take but a single illustration. The thought of the following is admirable:\u2014</p> <p>'There was a child went forth every day:<br>And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;<br>And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part<br>of the day,<br>Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years<br>...<br>The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt-marsh<br>and shore-mud;<br>These become part of that child who went forth every day, and<br>who now goes, and will always go forth every day.'</p> <p>But compare with it Wordsworth's treatment of the same theme:\u2014</p> <p>'The stars of mxml:idnight shall be dear<br>To her: and she shall lean her ear<br>In many a secret place,<br>Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br>And beauty born of murmuring sound<br>Shall pass into her face.'</p> <p>Whatever may be saxml:id in favour of Whitman's treatment, the advantages, so far as general effectiveness is concerned, are plainly with Wordsworth. The last two lines, besxml:ides having a fulness and suggestiveness about them quite equal to all that Whitman has saxml:id, or has attempted to say, have a music and a charm of expression on which the ear delights to dwell. Whitman's neglect of the art of expression is calculated, we think, to tell greatly against him. That he is capable of great things in this way we do not doubt. The poems referred to above, and others we could name, are a proof of the consummate work he might have done, had he been less impatient of restraint and more devoted to the perfecting of his skill in what is in reality one of the main sources of the poet's power. It must not be supposed, however, that Whitman is indifferent to the charms of art, or that, in his revolt against conventionalism, he has no rules or principles of his own. To those who imagine so we commend the perusal of what follows from the Preface of 1855:\u2014</p> <p>'The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity\u2014nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the road-sxml:ide, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of some flowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writings any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. What I tell I tell precisely for what is. Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my sxml:ide and look in the mirror with me.'</p> <p>In 'Children of Adam,' Whitman has sinned, we think, against good taste, common sense, and, in fact, as one of his critics has pointed out, against one of his own canons. True, he has probably violated no moral law, and has simply spoken of what nature permits. It is true also that according to Schiller, whatever nature permits, is permitted also to art. Still, there are some things on which men have agreed to be silent, and though we are by no means disposed to regard conventionality as the standard of morals, we cannot avoxml:id the conviction that by speaking of the sexual relations in the way in which he has, Whitman has violated a natural instinct of the human mind. That he is an immoral writer, as some of his critics have maintained, we do not believe. His fault is one of manner rather than of spirit, and has its origin in an error of judgement rather than in a wrong bias of the mind. His deepest spirit and highest aim are, it seems to us, religious; and nothing, we imagine, but a strong sense of duty could have made him withstand so patiently and persistently the fierce storm of invective and abuse which some of his poems have aroused against him.</p> <p>Whitman's faults, however, are greatly outweighed by his merits. First we may notice that in spirit he is intensely American. In the poets of other lands he is evxml:idently well read; yet, he is an imitator of none. His manner, style, and spirit are entirely his own. Previous to him the poetry of American was, as has been justly observed, merely the poetry of apt pupils, with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. The poems of Bryant and Longfellow might have been written as easily on the banks of the Thames as on the banks of the Hudson. There is little in them that is distinctively American. Whitman's poems, on the other hand, are saturated through and through with the spirit of the New World. 'Starting from Paumanock,' 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,' 'A Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Broad Axe,' 'A Song for Occupations,' 'Pioneers! O Pioneers!' 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' 'Drum-taps,' and 'Sea Drift,' it may be safely saxml:id, could not have been written elsewhere than on the American Continent, or by one whose spiritual life had not been reared among its people, and nourished by a life-long communion with its magnificent natural phenomena. Whitman is American also in another sense. He is thoroughly democratic. The Presxml:ident is no more to him than a mason, or woodsman, or western farmer. Any breath of a political aristocracy, of feudalism, or of caste, is not allowed to taint his pages. Their xml:ideas and institutions are entirely alien to his spirit. He could no more have written the xml:idylls of the King, or a play of Shakespeare than he could have written the Iliad. The doctrine which he preaches on every page is the greatness of the indivxml:idual soul. While Spencer writes 'to fashion a gentleman or nobleperson in virtuous and gentle discipline,' Whitman writes to build up a new and splendxml:id race of average men. As a poet of Democracy, as Democracy exists in the New World, he stands alone.</p> <p>'The messages of great poets to each man and woman,' he has remarked, 'are, Come to us on equal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you. What we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy.' Of his own poems, this is a marked feature. Their directness is unquestionable. They place the reader on a level with themselves, and make him feel that he is being addressed by one who is of the same flesh and blood as himself, by one whose thoughts and feelings are, or may be his own. And the reason is that, subjective as Whitman's poems are, and distinctively as they teach the doctrine of indivxml:idualism, they always rest on that which is universally human. Perhaps no other poet of the present has a larger vision of that 'great human heart by which we live,' or more persistently announces it. The 'self' of which he sings is not always his own indivxml:idual self; as frequently, if not more so, it is the universal self, that universal being of which each indivxml:idual is but a conscious manifestation. Of this any one can convince himself by a careful reading of the 'Song of Myself.' Take, for instance, the following lines:\u2014</p> <p>'I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning<br>and the end.<br>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now;'</p> <p>or take the lines with which the song opens:\u2014</p> <p>'I celebrate myself, and sing of myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belongs to me as good as belongs to you;'</p> <p>or these:\u2014</p> <p>'The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br>The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,<br>The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps<br>by his wife;<br>And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br>And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>And of these one and all I weave the song of myself,'</p> <p>This mysticism, indeed, forms the background of all Whitman's more important pieces, and is the key to their meaning. Without a clear apprehension of it it is impossible to understand the paradoxes in which his pages abound, or to reconcile his apparent contradictions. Were it not that we have Mr. Burroughs' assertion to the contrary, we should have attributed Whitman's mysticisms to a close study of Emerson. It seems, however, that before he published the first edition of the Leaves of Grass, Whitman had never read Emerson at all, and that he dxml:id not become acquainted with the Essay until the following summer. The similarity of their xml:ideas is remarkable, and may probably be taken as significant of the tendency of American thought.</p> <p>Whitman is pre-eminently a poet of the modern world. No other has more thoroughly adopted the conclusions of science, or made a more splendxml:id and impressive use of them in his writings. Not unseldom they give a vastness and grandeur to his thought, which is well-nigh overwhelming. At the same time he is very far from being in any sense or degree a materialist. The supremacy of the spiritual he always loyally, and sometimes ostentatiously, recognises. Though almost Greek in his sympathy with nature, and notwithstanding the manner in which he has sung of man's physical constitution, the position which he assigns to the soul is always incomparably higher, as the following from his Preface of 1876 clearly shows:\u2014</p> <p>'Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a higher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too) the spiritual the religious\u2014which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred-fold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the divine, and of the xml:ideal, through mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the objective worlds\u2026 To me the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendxml:id theology, and for ampler and diviner songs.'</p> <p>Still, notwithstanding his modern tone of thought, and the democratic spirit which pervades his writings, the past is by no means disdained by Whitman. Past, present, and future, he holds, are not disjoined but joined. The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been. The present, he affirms, is but a stage in the eternal process of creative thought, and is what is through the past. At the same time, however, while admitting his indebtedness to the past, and claming kinship with it, he asserts also his independence, and claims to stand in his own place with his own day about him:\u2014</p> <p>'I conn'd old times,<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.<br>In the name of These States shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p> <p>Dead poets, philosophers, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, investors, governments long since<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted<br>hither<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it)<br>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more<br>than it deserves,<br>Regarding it all intensely a long while, then dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place with my own day here.'</p> <p>We are warned, however, that our space is already exhausted, and can refer to but one other of the many features of Whitman's poetry. After pointing out that formerly he was consxml:idered the best poet who composed the most perfect work, or the one which was most complete in every respect, Sainte-Beuve has remarked that for us in the present the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's imagination and reflection; not he who has done the best, but he who suggests the most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, who leaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in your turn.' Judged by this standard Whitman deserves to take a place among the foremost. His works are preeminently suggestive. Any finished picture he seldom presents. His poems are rather suggestions, arousing the reader, and leading him on and on, till he feels the fresher air of a freer thought breathing around him, and sees spreading out before him the limitless and unknown.</p> <p>'I but write one or two indicative words for the future,<br>I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.<br>I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a<br>casual look upon you, and then averts his face,<br>Leaving it to you to prove and define it,<br>Expecting the main things from you.'</p> <p>To the religious spirit which breathes through Whitman's writings we have already referred; and our assertions on this point have been borne out by several of the passages we have cited for other purposes. Dxml:id our space permit, numerous other passages might be cited as bearing directly upon it. But as a last word, and as indicating with consxml:iderable fullness the scope and spirit of all that he has written, we transcribe the following:\u2014</p> <p>'And thou America,<br>For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality<br>For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.</p> <p>'Thou, too, surroundest all,<br>Embracing, carrying, welcoming all, thou, too, by pathways broad and<br>new,<br>To the xml:ideal tendest.</p> <p>'The measur'd faith of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,<br>Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,<br>Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,<br>All eligible to all.</p> <p>'All for immortality,<br>Love like the light silently wrapping all,<br>Nature's amelioration blessing all,<br>The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,<br>Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening.</p> <p>'Give me, O God, to sing that thought<br>Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,<br>In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,<br>Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,<br>Health, peace, salvation, universal.</p> <p>'Is it a dream?<br>Nay, but the lack of it the dream?<br>And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,<br>And all the world a dream.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217P. 183.</p><p>\u2020Notes on Walt Whitman, pp. 15-16.</p><p>\u2021Studies in Literature, 1789\u20131877, p. 473.</p>", "date": "September 1883", "year": 1883, "creator": "William Musham Metcalfe", "publication": "The Scottish Review", "citation": "Metcalfe, William Musham [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman.\" September 1883.

(Walter Scott.)</p><p>WALT WHITMAN and his admirers have good reason to be grateful to Mr. Ernest Rhys. A year ago he edited for the well-known series of 'Canterbury Poets' a selection from Leaves of Grass for English readers; and now, in the companion 'Camelot' series of which he has charge, he is reproducing Whitman's prose writings. In this way he has done more than has been attempted before to popularise these works. It is curious that the writings of the 'Poet of Democracy' have had to wait so long before they were fairly laid before the democracy. Whitman's books have been expensive and scarce. Now, at length, the verdict of the people is asked, whose life and occupations he has studied and celebrated in poetry, and to whose ranks he does himself belong.</p> <p>The present volume contains about one half of the work issued a few years ago with the title Specimen Days and Collect. The 'Collect,' with some additions, will form a companion volume. In a brief preface Whitman invites</p> <p>'the reader in the British Isles' to 'take the following pages, as you do some long and gossipy letter written for you by a relative or friend travelling through distant scenes and incidents and jotting them down lazily and informally, but ever veraciously (with occasional diversions of critical thought about somebody or something).'</p> <p>They certainly contain a curious mixture: something about his family and ancestors; notes of his experiences during the Civil War, contributed at the time they were written to the New York Times or some other newspaper; his opinion of sundry great men whom he has known personally or through their books; a little philosophy, a little science, a little criticism, and numerous occasional notes on all sorts of themes. He has immense self-assurance. His ideas and impressions, like the ideas and impressions of other people, may be very well worth noting; but other people think their readers are entitled to some consideration in the manner the writings are set before them, whereas Whitman presents his promiscuously, as who should say, 'If you don't like it, you must lump it;' or rather as though he did not dream fro one moment that any intelligent person could fail to like it. There are, doubtless, ardent disciples of Whitman to whom his slightest word is laden with wisdom, and who find infinite depth of meaing in his commonest utterance. They will be delighted to learn that he thought once of calling his book 'Cedar Plums like,' and will admire the reasons in favour of so singular a title which weighed with him before it 'got its nose put out of joint.' The ordinary reader, however, find such information insignificant.</p> <p>If, however, this ordinary reader does not take offence at Whitman's unceremonious treatment of him\u2014and there really is no good reason why he should\u2014he will find much to instruct and much to charm him in this singular miscellany. The 'familiar letter' method has advantages of its own, 'portraying American eyesights and incidents as they actually occurred' with a freedom and realism which would be wanting in a more carefully prepared work.</p> <p>Even persons who dislike Whitman as a writer cannot fail to honour him for his admirable services to humanity in the hospitals during the Civil War. The notes written at the time contain many touching records of suffering and heroism. After the war Whitman remained in government employ for some years until, in February 1873, he was stricken with paralysis, and had to relinquish active life. He retired into the country, where he wrote his nature-notes. These naturally recall the similar records of Thoreau. Thoreau, however, was a disinterested student of nature, whereas Whitman is always more or less concerned with the relation of nature to himself. He breaks off his description of some fine trees to relate a dream he had that his favourite trees stepped from their places and promenaded up and down 'very curiously, with a whisper from one, leaning down as he passed me, 'we do all this on the present occasion exceptionally, just for you.'' In like manner he finishes a pretty passage about the birds by announcing his 'positive conviction that some of these birds sing and others fly and flirt about here for my especial benefit.' There is, however, no lack of sympathetic understanding in his intercourse with nature. He seems to include the very plants, animals, and sea, and sky in his 'comradeship.' Some of his descriptions of natural scenery are exceedingly fine. Night and the stars have a peculiar attraction for him:</p> <p>'Perfect, or nearly perfect, days,' he says, 'are not so very uncommon; but the combinations that make perfect nights are few, even in a lifetime. We have one of those perfections to-night. . . . A large part of the sky seemed just laid in great splashes of phosphorus. You could look deeper in, further through than usual; the orbs thick as heads of wheat in a field. Not that there was any special brilliancy either\u2014nothing near so sharp as I have seen of keen winter nights, but a curious general luminousness throughout to sight, sense, and soul. The latter had much to do with it. (I am convinced that there are hours of nature, especially of the atmosphere, mornings and evenings, addressed to the soul. Night transcends for that purpose what the proudest days can do.) Now, indeed, if never before, the heavens declared the glory of God. It was to the full the sky of the Bible, of Arabia, of the prophets, and of the oldest poems. There, in abstraction and stillness. . . . the copiousness, the removedness, vitality, [loose clear crowdedness] of that stellar concave spreading overhead, softly absorb'd into me, rising so free, [interminably] high, stretching east, west, north, south, and I, though but a point in the centre below, emobyding all. As if for the first time, indeed, creation noiselessly sank into and through me its placid and untellable lesson, beyond\u2014O, so infinitely beyond!\u2014anything from art, books, sermons, or from science, old or new. The spirit's hour\u2014religion's hour\u2014the visible suggestion of God in space and time, now once definitely indicated, if never again. The untold pointed at the heavens all paved with it. The Milky Way, as if some superhuman symphony, some ode of universal vagueness, disdaining syllable and sound\u2014a flashing glance of Deity, address'd to the soul. All silently\u2014the indescribable night and stars\u2014far off and silently.'</p> <p>Among the judgments\u2014well worth attention\u2014that Whitman pronounces on some of his contemporaries one of the best is on Carlyle, in which he says that</p> <p>'not for his merely literary merit (though that was great), not as a 'maker of books,' but as launching into the self-complacent atmosphere of our days a rasping, questioning, dislocating agitation and shock, is Carlyle's real value.'</p> <p>I apply the words to Whitman himself. Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson has, quite recently, made confession that Leaves of Grass was of singular service to him, because, he says, it</p> <p>'tumbled the world upside down for me, blew into space a thousand cobwebs of genteel and ethical illusion, and, having thus shaken my tabernacle of lies, set me back again upon a strong foundation of all the original and manly virtues.'</p> <p>The stimulating quality of Whitman's work is great. As Prof. Dowden says, he may attract or repel or do 'anything except leave us indifferent.' When we go to him we know at any rate that we shall hear his thought, not an echo, and so shall receive moral inspiration and mental stimulus. He shames us out of too ready acquiescence in usage and custom. He seems to say Be yourself. I remarked at the beginning of this article that Whitman and his admirers have good reason to be grateful for these cheap editions of the poet's works. Still more should the people of this country be grateful that such works are brought within their easy reach.</p> <p>WALTER LEWIN.</p>", "date": "June 4 1887", "year": 1887, "creator": "Walter Lewin", "publication": "The Academy", "citation": "Lewin, Walter. \"[Review of Specimen Days and Collect].\" 4 June 1887.

There must be something or even a great deal in an author who is able, if not to command the acceptance of his theories and ideas, at least to make them the subject of a controversy, which, after going on for more than thirty years, seems to be still as far as ever from reaching a settlement. 'Leaves of Grass,' the book which first made Whitman a public character, was published in 1855, and after the thirty-three years which have elapsed since then its status as a literary production remains undetermined. There are those\u2014and they include men of cultivated taste, enlightened judgment and unimpeachable integrity\u2014who declare that, all things considered, Whitman is perhaps the greatest, the most original, the most characteristic poet that America has yet produced, and singularly enough the most eminent of the critics who hold to this opinion are Englishmen between whose high culture and the unpolished ruggedness of Whitman one would not expect to find any bond of sympathy. What, for example, within the compass of literary production could be further removed than the mellifluous strains of 'The Princess' or The Idylls of the King, and the defiant rudeness of Whitman's writings, and yet it is said that Alfred Tennyson, influenced perhaps by a feeling akin to that which impels the curled darlings of civilization to seek in the primitive wilderness a respite from an excess of cultivation and refinement, is one of the 'good grey poet's' most enthusiastic admirers.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>On the other hand, there are those, and they also comprise men of honesty and discernment, to whom Whitman's so-called poetry is nothing but 'a barbaric yawp,' and the best of his lines little better than a senseless jargon. How can one account for opinions so widely dissimilar? Which of the two is right, and if neither, in what happy medium does the truth lie hid? Is Whitman a great poet, one of the inspired writers who once in a while appear among men to open up new hemispheres of thought, or is he a kind of monomaniac possessed and dominated by ideas which he is powerless to formulate, haunted by the vision of the great projects which he lacks the ability to execute; a man who, having just fallen short of being a genius, still has in his composition that strain of madness to which genius is said to be allied? Is he inspired or is he crazy, or what shall we say of him? It seems to me from what I have read of his writings, and of the commentaries and explanations by which he has, not unintelligently, thought well to supplement them, that Whitman is a man intoxicated with a single idea, that of the incomparable importance of the bare, the naked fact. He is essentially if not exclusively a realist, and by a realist as descriptive of Whitman I mean a man who is mistrustful of all things save those that can be seen and felt and handled; who is so enamored of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, that to him the graces of style are a snare and the adornments of fancy a delusion\u2014a man whose impulse it is to get so close to nature that he is never satisfied to be any distance away from the great primary passions and the instincts of humanity.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Now this ardent devotion to the True, this noble abhorrence of anything that might savor of insincerity, is admirable and excellent, and so far as Whitman's poetry has made the impression it was intended to produce and has won the favor of readers it has done so by virtue of this very quality. There is so much insincerity in literature, and especially in the mass of what passes for a time as poetry; writers, and particularly second rate poets, are so prone to put forward as their own, thoughts and feelings and ideas that they have taken at second-hand from some one else; custom and convention play so large a part in the making of modern books that to turn to Whitman, whose work, whatever may be its faults and limitations, is wholly his own, and free from the smallest taint of imitation or conventionality, is like passing from a crowded and heated theatre into the open air. The bare fact unquestionably has an interest and power which are unsurpassed and unsurpassable, and no set of facts is more interesting to men and women than those facts which reveal the workings of the human mind and heart. The 'study of mankind is man,' and there is no study more fascinating\u2014none that has to be carried on under greater difficulties. Men and women are so reluctant, or rather, perhaps, so unable to furnish one another with the necessary facilities for investigation. The great masters of the human heart must arrive at their conclusions and amass their knowledge by a process of intuition, for it is the truth in another sense from that intended by the Apostle, that every man lives to himself and every man dies to himself. The spiritual isolation of each is ordinarily complete.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Such being the case a book which, like 'Leaves of Grass,' is an unmistakably sincere expression of human feeling, a simple and unaffected revelation of the human soul, is sure to have a welcome and make some kind of mark. It is in this way, it seems to me, that such success as 'Leaves of Grass' and the other of Mr. Whitman's books have had must be accounted for. They are made impressive by a devotion to fact so uncompromising that it rejects all the ornaments of rhetoric lest they obscure and distort or in the smallest degree modify the author's meaning. Whitman is mistrustful of rhyme and rhythm because he fears that if he uses them they will betray him into saying or suggesting something different from what he intended, a fear for which there is abundant reason. However gracefully the burden may be borne, however skilfully the chain may be concealed, the exigencies of verse, and especially of rhyme, are a burden and a chain none the less and it is their natural, their unavoidable tendency to restrict or hamper the free expression of a writer's ideas, and even to give a bias to his choice of language, which may sometimes lead him to present his thoughts with something less than perfect truthfulness and accuracy. I can understand, therefore, how a man like Walt Whitman, determined above all things to set forth his ideas with unswerving sincerity and absolute originality, should eschew the limitations of verse and prefer, even if he had to invent it, a literary vehicle which he could use with perfect freedom.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Yet assuming this to be the case, assuming that Whitman felt that he could not trust himself to write with force and faithfulness under the forms of verse, does it not follow that whatever other faculties he may possess, the true poetical inspiration has been denied him? He may be a great writer, a profound philosopher, a pregnant essayist, but surely if he does not employ a poetical method of expression he cannot be a poet, great or small. This, however, opens up a field of discussion upon which, however inviting the prospect, I do not at this time propose to enter. Let us assume for the present that Whitman is just as much of a poet as his most ardent admirers would have us believe, and having made that admission, pro forma, proceed to consider why his books have not attained\u2014I will not say to a greater popularity, for popularity is far from being a criterion of merit\u2014but to a more general and cordial acceptance at the hands of educated and intelligent people. I suspect that the most active reason is to be found in the circumstance that Whitman expects too much of his readers. He insists that they shall be partakers in his travail; that they shall both witness and have a share in the throes of his intellectual parturition. He uses language less to express than to suggest ideas, and to follow out the suggestions he makes involves a degree of mental toil to which few readers are willing to subject themselves. He does not arrange his words so that they shall the most clearly, the most happily, the most forcefully, convey his meaning, while at the same time drawing as little as possible upon the mental resources of the reader. Indeed he does not arrange his words at all. He piles them up: he throws them together; he scatters them broadcast. His poetry may not be void, but unquestionably it is without form. It is too often as though an artist should throw his paint brush at the canvas, and require the onlooker by the exercise of his imagination to evolve a picture out of the splash. So it is with these poems of Whitman. They contain the raw material out of which poems might be made; but the reader is obliged for the most part to do his own poetizing as best he can. Now the modern reader is accustomed to having things made easy for him. He will do no more private thinking of his own than is absolutely necessary, and when it comes to toiling in Walt Whitman's rough sketches of potential poems he respectfully declines the job.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>As for Whitman's latest volume, while it contains nothing essentially new, it does contain a great deal that is interesting, notably the article 'A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads,' in which the author expounds the methods and theories and purposes animating and underlying his literary work. Poetry, however, properly so-called, is not consciously written according to any method, or with any purpose, or upon any theory. It may be true, as Whitman insists, that this great Republic, in which men and women live out their lives under conditions different from and better than any heretofore existing since the world began, must produce such poetry as has never yet been known, although as poetry is the expression of human feeling, and human nature remains the same in a republic as in an empire, the point is at least debatable. But the great American poem when it comes will certainly not be written with deliberate intent. It will not be the work of anyone who shall say to himself: 'Now upon this theory or that I will write an epic.'</p><p>GEORGE ROGERS.</p>", "date": "October 25 1888", "year": 1888, "creator": "George Rogers", "publication": "The North American", "citation": "Rogers, George. \"Walt Whitman Again.\" 25 October 1888.

This opening chapter can scarcely be called autobiographical. It is rather the poet's review in his old age of what he conceives were his intentions in his manhood's prime when he wrote 'Leaves of Grass.' He confesses that as a poet he has not gained the acceptance of his own time\u2014that from a worldly and business point of view 'Leaves of Grass' has been worse than a failure. It is plain that even in his serene old age Mr. Whitman still feels the wounds made by the 'marked anger and contempt' with which his book was received. What he considers that he has positively gained in the thirty years since 'Leaves of Grass' was published is a hearing, and he is willing to leave the value of his work to be determined by time.</p><p>What Mr. Whitman claims as the motif of nearly all his verse is 'the great pride of man in himself.' The personality in his songs which such a motif implies the poet deliberately settled at the outset should be himself. 'Leaves of Grass' he therefore claims as mainly the outcropping of his own emotional and other personal nature\u2014as an attempt from first to last to put a person, a human being, himself, fully and truly upon record. Mr. Whitman does not deny but courageously avows that 'Leaves of Grass' is a song of sex and amativeness\u2014even of animality. 'Of this feature,' he says, 'intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted.' And he stands by his guns to the last. 'And in respect to editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come, if there should be such,' he declares.

Like all that he has written, they are not to be criticised, for the writer's literary creed denies and defies criticism. He is himself, and has the faith in his self-hood that every sturdy revolutionist or sincere reformer has. He may be right or he may be wrong, but his standard is his own, and he is brave enough to maintain it. This volume is a collection of bits that Whitman has published in magazines or newspapers. Many are in prose, in fact all may be so called, although some are poetical in their typographical arrangement. In the first twelve pages is an explanation or defence of his 'Leaves of Grass.' This is in many respects a noble composition, in spite of its frequent disregard of literary and academic conventions. The collection of thoughts called 'Sands at Seventy,' cannot be called poetical, though the printed lines suggest it. Still there are occasional flashes of poetic light, which gleam through an excess of bigwordiness. But this remark borders on criticism, and that is forbidden when Whitman's contemporaries consider him. He has his own ideas of grammar, phraseology and the meaning of words, English and French, and he is not to be disturbed in his rights. What we especially admire in him is his stout, tough Americanism, his faith in his country, its government, and its people. His 'War Memoranda,' his reminiscences of his devoted labors in the army hospitals, and his noble tribute to Lincoln (not so tender as the really rhythmic verses 'My Captain'), are things for young Americans to study. His literary essays on Burns, Tennyson and Shakespeare stir the sympathies of all lovers of the English language. More elaborate and long than all is the paper on Elias Hicks,1 which is a fervid tribute to one man, and a lesson to many.

The design of the book is evidently to round out and comment upon his other works and to add a few more poems to the hitherto complete 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>It is an admirable book for those to read who wish to know Whitman, to discover how calm, patient and philosophical he really is. It is no longer in order to assault him, even if we do not agree with him, and the number of people who begin to understand and admire this great personality is increasing. As Stedman has said, 'Whitman cannot be skipped,' he must be studied by whomever would lay claim to the name of critic or student of American thought, and such person cannot do better than begin study by reading 'November Boughs,' and especially the calm estimate which the author himself puts upon his work, in the initial essay, 'O'er Travelled Roads.'</p><p>'So here I sit gossiping in the early candle-light of old age\u2014I and my book\u2014casting backward glances over our travelled road\u2026That I have not gained the acceptance of my own time but have fallen back on fond dreams of the future; that from a worldly and business point of view, 'Leaves of Grass' has been worse than a failure; that public criticism on the book, and myself, as author of it, yet shows marked anger and contempt more than anything else; and that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious official buffetings\u2014is all probably no more than I ought to have expected. I had my choice when I commenced. I bid neither for soft eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions.'</p><p>In calculating the decision of the world upon his book, he says William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke are far more peremptory than he, and regards the fact that he has obtained a hearing as of prime importance:</p><p>'Essentially that from the first, and has remained throughout the main object. Now it seems to be achieved, I am certainly contented to waive any otherwise momentous drawbacks as of little account. Candidly and dispassionately reviewing all my intentions, I feel that they were creditable, and I accept the result, whatever it may be.'</p><p>Surely these are dignified and reasonable words, with which no one can quarrel. People in general are coming to think that his intentions were creditable, and no one who has really known him or brought himself to the poet's point of view has ever thought otherwise. The supreme barrier has been ignorance of the poet's real life (his service to his fellows, the ready self- sacrifice and the boundless love for all conditions of life), which has always barred the way to knowing his works. In the bitterness of the controversy the critics befogged the public mind, at times wilfully misrepresenting him, leaving out of their columns all reference to his sublime service to men during the civil war and his never-failing sympathy towards the poor and ignorant, as well as his tolerance of beliefs opposed to his.</p><p>The admirers of Whitman (if I may be allowed to represent them) do not complain at the non-acceptance of his work as poetry, but they do complain, and have reason to complain, of the distortion of the poet's intention and the misrepresentation of his private life. I for one have no quarrel with any one who honestly objects to Whitman's being called a poet, but with those who raise the point (happily they are few now) that his intentions were not creditable, I certainly do take decided issue.</p><p>After all, the controversy about poetry is mostly a contention about a word. I read a passage from Whitman like this:</p><p>'I stand as on some mighty eagle's beak,<br>Eastward the sea absorbing, viewing (nothing but <br>sea and sky)<br>The tossing waves, the foam, the ships in dis-<br>tance,<br>The wild unrest, the snowy curling caps\u2014that in- <br>bound verge of waves,<br>Seeking the shore forever.'</p><p>I say this is poetry, you say 'it is passionate descriptive speech.' Very well. It doesn't matter what you call it. A great picture is there. Emotion is there, and a certain resonant, free song is there. The name does not matter. This example will do as well as hundreds to illustrate the present attitude of those who call Whitman a poet and those who do not. Opponents no longer find it necessary to assault the poet's character in order to justify their dislike of his writings, and on the other hand the 'Whitmanites' are ready to make certain concessions, and altogether an understanding is being reached. I think no one can read 'Specimen Days,' and especially the war memoranda, without coming to venerate the man who spent years in the hospitals (visiting the bedsides of over one hundred thousand soldiers), laying the foundations for the sickness which chained him to his chair before he was sixty years of age, despite a magnificent physique.</p><p>There is a very significant memorandum in this last volume touching the physical effect of his experience in the hospital:</p><p>'WASHINGTON, May 26, '63. It is curious: when I am present at the most appalling scenes, deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots), I keep cool and do not give out or budge, although my sympathies are very much excited; but often, hours afterward, perhaps, when I am at home or out walking alone, I feel sick and actually tremble when I recall the case before me.'This gives us a glimpse of the horrors of the labor which undermined one of the superbest physical organizations.</p><p>Coming at Whitman from this side (through his prose) the student will get close to the author of 'Leaves of Grass' and be prepared to look from the same height upon the 'objectionable' passages. Appreciating his motive and catching somewhat of the same breadth of view, the reader will find no line with a downward tendency.</p><p>Here, again, the time has come for the correction of an error. 'Leaves of Grass' is now a volume of over four hundred pages, and yet in the midst of this unparalleled grouping of great thoughts and superb images, there are not ten lines to which the ordinary reader of Shakespeare could consistently point as objectionable. This must not be forgotten. Waiving the claim that it is not 'poetry,' as commonly understood, and agreeing that to many people there are objectionable passages, it still appears to me unreasonable to hold a prejudice against a most remarkable outpouring of exalted passion, prophecy, landscape painting, songs of the sea and, above all, calls for deeper love for Nature and for men. I have faith to believe that the circle of readers who feel this toward Whitman is constantly growing and must continue to grow as men grow to know him.</p><p>The advocates of Whitman's case have demanded too much of the public; they have not taken into account as well as he has the inertia of the average mind, whose thinking is necessarily along well-worn grooves, and can be but slowly and unwillingly turned aside. We insist now on the critics taking a new stand on the matter. Whitman is no longer a mystery; he is a serene, gentle, grand old man, living in Camden, who sends us what he thinks in his final volume, desiring readers and friends amidst the democracy, which he loves so well, his faith not shaken by all the buffetings, unkindnesses and neglect which he has received. We should hasten to do him honor while he is with us. Praise too often builds monuments when it should buy bread; furnishes tombstones where it should warm houses. Royal praise for the hearing ear, I say, flowers of love for the throbbing sense of the living poet. I present my tribute, drop my bit of laurel into the still warm, firm hand of the victorious singer.</p><p>I copy one of the poems of the present volume, which contains nearly a score of essays:</p><p><em>OF THAT BLITHE THROAT OF THINE.</em></p><p>[More than eighty degrees north, Greely, the ex-<br>plorer, heard the sound of a single snowbird, mer-<br>rily sounding over the desolation.]<br>Of that blithe throat of thine from Arctic bleak<br> and blank,<br>I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird\u2014let me, too, welcome<br> chilling drifts,<br>E'en the profoundest chill as now\u2014a torpid pulse, <br>a brain unnerved,<br>Old age land-locked within its winter bay.

Let the final decision be as it may upon the one point whether his verse is materially injured by its irregularity of form, it is certain that there is in it a vital spirit, poetical in its nature, and that this has found, and doubtless will continue to find, its circle of admirers. The examples in this volume are marked by characteristics with which those in his previous books made us familiar, with the exception that none of these incur objection on the score of propriety. They show perhaps, less force, less ruggedness, less of the extreme Whitmanesque individuality, while they incline more to retrospection, and a vein of chastened sadness. There is no rhyme, of course, but occasionally there is a verse almost smooth in metre, and regular in the flow of its rhythm, as for instance this 'After the Dazzle of Day':</p><p>'After the dazzle of day is gone,<br>Only the dark, dark night shows to my eye the stars;<br>After the clangor of organ majestic, or chorus, or perfect band,<br>Silent, athwart my soul, moves the symphony true.'</p><p>And there are others equally as notable in this respect, of greater length: we quote this partly on account of its brevity.</p><p>The prose papers include a long one, placed first in the book, (the poetry follows it), entitled 'A Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads.' In this he reviews in fourteen pages, his own work, explaining his purpose, his plan, his form of thought. He justifies the much,\u2014and as we have always held, justly,\u2014criticised lines in 'Leaves of Grass,' and insists that they shall not be elided in future edition, 'if there should be such.' Others of the papers refer to his hospital experiences, to Shakespeare, Burns, and Tennyson, to Lincoln, to Father Taylor the Boston preacher, etc., etc., all notable in style and matter, and some extremely vivid and striking. At the last he gives an extended sketch of Elias Hicks, the Quaker preacher of Long Island, whom he knew in his boyhood, and whose character he highly appreciates.</p><p>This is a very important addition to the list of Whitman's books. The matter is so compactly inserted that there is much more than might be supposed. If it were spread out as often is done, the poetry alone would fill a thin volume, while another could be made of the Notes on Elias Hicks. The 'Backward Glance' is entitled to an attentive reading, as a statement, final no doubt, of his own view of his poetry, and this alone deserves a much more careful and elaborate consideration than we have been able to give in this notice.</p>", "date": "November 24 1888", "year": 1888, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The American", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of November Boughs].\" 24 November 1888.

The aggressive, virile personality of one who brooks no conventional limitations has here free and ample expression; and while we may question the literary value of much or of all that he has written, we cannot, if we are impartial in judgment, fail to recognize and in some sort to admire the native goodness of heart and the lofty ideals of the man. Through his printed words, from the introduction to Leaves of Grass to his latest messages inscribed in the volume now before us, there runs the self-same vigorous reiterated note\u2014the note of comradeship, the yearning after that ideal democracy where fraternity shall be something more than a name and where each shall give of his best for the good of others. In this sense, as a prophet of the new era for which so many now long and wait, Walt Whitman stands on the whole pre\u00ebminent among moderns. He has failed and failed lamentably in his attempt to construct a new technique in verse, but at least he has shattered the old bonds, he has broken the outworn mold, he has cast his ideas into natural forms, and in this he has conferred a benefit upon the world of writers which will in time be recognized. At a period filled to overflowing with the pettiest manifestations of art that ever stifled the intellect of humanity, he alone has dared to be wholly and entirely himself. He has taught, as far as his voice has reached, that literature is something more than a playing with words, that it is a vital thing, the expression of a nation's thought, and that before we can have a national literature we must think great thoughts and do great deeds. Success in barter does not make a nation and the heaping up of material luxury cannot make a national literature. The form of expression is something, but the idea back of the form is the main thing, and that is what the world, or at least the western part of it, has been prone to forget. 'I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader,' Whitman remarks, 'is not merely to satisfy the intellect, or supply something polish'd and interesting, nor even to depict great passions, or persons, or events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him good heart as a radical possession and habit.' To give good heart as a radical possession and habit\u2014that is not an ignoble standard in literature certainly, and yet how few there are in these days who even keep it in view. To satisfy the superficial appetite for sensation, to please, to cajole, to flatter, to titillate\u2014to this end is the generality of literature in this country now produced. Whitman sounds the note of revolt against universal self-indulgence and boredom. To read him, even when he is at his worst, is for a healthy mind to get a bracing tonic. His poems (for we must call them so) are as suggestive in their way as the cartoons of the old masters. They foreshadow possibilities, they appeal in some inscrutable way to the imagination, they stimulate, for they are inspired by the optimism which sees in man something more than the grovelling component of a selfish herd, and which, looking to wider horizons and heights yet unattained, urges him onward in the struggle toward liberty. For these reasons we can welcome in behalf of reason and sanity whatever Walt Whitman chooses to give us, even these fruits of later years from November Boughs. Whether he is taking 'A Backward Glance' over the road he has traveled; or poetizing in the old, familiar vein; or discoursing of the Bible, and Shakespeare, and Burns, and Tennyson; or giving reminiscences of Father Taylor, and Lincoln, and Elias Hicks; or detailing his memoranda of the war, he is in every instance supplying some hint or record which we should be sorry to lose. If we can thank the author for nothing else we can at least thank him for the candid revelation of his inmost thought, for the attempt, however ineffective, faithfully to portray the aspect of the universe as reflected from the mirror of his own soul.</p><p>\u2217 November Boughs By Walt Whitman.

Philadelphia: David McKay.</p><p>It seems probable that this volume will be the last published by Walt Whitman, and it is a gathering together of many fragments, mostly in prose. The verse consists of the short pieces under the head 'Sands at Seventy,' a little collection which fairly exhibits the poet's strength and weakness, and in proportions indicating the maintenance by him of a curious stability of quality. In the prose part of November Boughs, the opening paper entitled 'A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads' will be to many readers the most interesting, for the reason that it is a restatement of the considerations which, in his eyes, justify the peculiarities of this form and method. Here, too, is to be noted evidence of an unchanging point of view which in Whitman's case is more than the effect of advancing age - though that, too, is partly accountable for it. The poet himself ingenuously supposes that his departure from accepted methods and his effort to resurrect our archaic form of expression, together with his insistence upon a realism which is so exaggerated as to be unnatural, arise wholly from a radical spirit of reform. In this he has always been to a great extent mistaken, for his peculiarities are at bottom much more the results of a certain narrowness and want of both sympathy and elasticity than of originality and the zeitgeist.</p><p>The very fact that his strongest poems are those in which he displays his eccentric method least should have bred mistrust in him of the soundness of his theories. The fact that, while believing himself the poet of the people, he has never been accepted by the people as their poet, should have led him to question the infallibility of his inspiration, and above all have forced him to ask himself whether, after all, he saw the democratic movement of his time as it really was. But it is clearly enough shown in this, his last volume, that Walt Whitman's fundamental misapprehensions are ineradicable, and no stronger proof of this could be adduced than his declaration of belief that the future progress of the United States is to be largely spiritual, and the parallel implication that his poetry represents a step in this direction. Age, indeed, has sobered him considerably, and in his last poems we miss the defiant tone with which he was wont to reinforce his assaults upon all the conventionalities. There is, too, less crudeness and more melody in his verse, and less, be it said also, of that impetuous panoramic tendency which formerly converted some of his most ambitious pieces into the semblance of fantastic catalogues. His prose style is marked by some, but not all, of the defects which mar his poems, but it is generally clear enough in meaning, and at times vigorous, if never graceful.</p>", "date": "December 9 1888", "year": 1888, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New-York Daily Tribune", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of November Boughs].\" 9 December 1888.

With portrait. David McKay, Philadelphia.</p><p>This book is as varied in contents as its author's own mind. In it the reader will find poems, essays, biographies (these being of preachers only), war memoranda and extracts from diaries. Many of the poems have already been seen by the Herald's readers, being first published in these columns. The HERALD also gave some weeks ago a foretaste of the old poet's sketch of Elias Hicks.</p><p>Everything in this book is interesting, though the portion which will probably be most closely read is the author's sketch of himself and his literary purposes. Necessarily it impels large mention of 'Leaves of Grass,' the best abused volume of verse ever published, 'Don Juan' not excepted.</p><p>Behind all else that can be said, I consider 'Leaves of Grass' and its theory experimental\u2014as, in the deepest sense, I consider our American Republic itself to be, with its theory. (I think I have at least enough philosophy not to be too absolutely certain of any thing or any results.) In the second place, the volume is a sortie\u2014whether to prove triumphant, and conquer its field of aim and escape and construction, nothing less than a hundred years from now can fully answer. I consider the point that I have positively gained a hearing to far more than make up for any and all other lacks and withholdings. Essentially, that was from the first, and has remained throughout, the main object. Now it seems to be achieved, I am certainly contented to waive any otherwise momentous drawbacks as of little account. Candidly and dispassionately reviewing all my intentions, I feel that they were creditable\u2014and I accept the result, whatever it may be. After continued personal ambition and effort as a young fellow to enter with the rest into competition for the usual rewards, business, political, literary, &c., to take part in the great melee, both for victory's prize itself and to do some good; after years of those aims and pursuits, I found myself remaining possessed, at the age of thirty-one to thirty-three, with a special desire and conviction. Or rather, to be quite exact, a desire that had been flitting through my previous life, or hovering on the flanks, mostly indefinite hitherto, had steadily advanced to the front, defined itself and finally dominated everything else. This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary or poetic form and uncompromisingly my own physical, emotional, moral, intellectual and aesthetic personality in the midst of and tallying the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days and of current America, and to exploit that personality, identified with place and date, in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book.</p><p>That to this extent the author fully succeeded will be admitted by Walt's most savage literary and moral critics. But, regarding 'Leaves of Grass,' let the author speak further:\u2014</p><p>I should say it were useless to attempt reading the book without first carefully tallying that preparatory background and quality in the mind. Think of the United States to-day\u2014the facts of these thirty-eight or forty empires soldered in one\u2014sixty or seventy millions of equals, with their lives, their passions, their futures\u2014these incalculable, modern, American, seething multitudes around us, of which we are inseparable pairs! Think, in comparison, of the petty environage and limited area of the poets of past or present Europe, no matter how great their genius. Think of the absence and ignorance in all cases hitherto of the multitudinousness, vitality and the unprecedented stimulants as if a poetry with cosmic and dynamic features of magnitude and limitlessness suitable to the human soul were never possible before. It is certain that a poetry of absolute faith and equality for the use of the democratic masses never was. Does not the best thought of our day and Republic conceive of a birth and spirit of song superior to anything past or present? To the effectual and moral consolidation of our lauds (already, as materially establish'd, the greatest factors in known history, and far, far greater through what they prelude and necessitate and are to be in future)\u2014to conform with and build on the concrete realities and theories of the universe furnish'd by science, and henceforth the only irrefragable basis for anything, verse included\u2014to root both influences in the emotional and imaginative action of the modern time, and dominate all that precedes or opposes them\u2014is not either a radical advance and step forward or a new verteber of the best song indispensable?</p><p>On a delicate division of his subject\u2014or indelicate division, as many readers have insisted and will always continue to insist\u2014the author says:\u2014</p><p>From another point of view 'Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of sex and amativeness, and even animality\u2014though meanings that do not usually go along with those words are behind all and will duly emerge\u2014and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women toward the thought and fact of sexuality, as an element in character, personality, the emotions and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. The vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance\u2014like the clef of a symphony. At last analogy the lines I allude to and the spirit in which they are spoken permeate all 'Leaves of Grass,' and the work must stand or fall with them, as the human body and soul must remain as an entirety. Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that 'heroic nudity' on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p><p>The commonest question about Whitman has always been the same, although variously expressed, 'What does he mean?' 'What is his idea of his mission as a poet?' 'At what is he driving?' In this book the answer is written simply enough:\u2014</p><p>I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect or supply something polished and interesting, nor even to depict great passions or persons or events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him good heart as a radical possession and habit.</p>", "date": "December 23 1888", "year": 1888, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Herald", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman Unbosoms Himself About Poetry.\" 23 December 1888.

Surely, now that Christmas approaches, 'tis time to put our wisdom to the proof and make merry with that 'good heart' which, according to Walt Whitman, it is the best service of literature to give us 'as a radical possession and habit.'

The book which starts no echo is without meaning to us.

'I look upon 'Leaves of Grass' as my definitive carte visite to the coming generations of the New World.' 'That I have not gain'd the acceptance of my own time; that from a worldly and business point of view 'Leaves of Grass' has been worse than a failure\u2014that public criticism on the book and myself shows mark'd anger and contempt more than anything else; and that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious special official buffetings\u2014is all probably no more than I ought to have expected.

'The best comfort of the whole business is that I have had my say entirely my own way\u2014the value thereof to be decided by time.'</p><p>Then as to the nature of 'Leaves of Grass.' 'It gives one man's identity, ardors, observations, faiths, and thoughts, color'd hardly at all with any decided coloring from other faiths or other identities.' 'I would sing, and leave out or put in, quite solely with reference to America and to-day.' 'The true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only. Without that ultimate vivification, which the poet or other artist alone can give, reality would seem incomplete, and science, democracy, and life itself, finally in vain.' 'I know very well that my 'Leaves' could not possibly have emerged from any other era than the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, nor any other land than democratic America, and from the absolute triumph of the National Union arms.' 'The Old World has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great: but the New World needs the poems of realities and science, and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the centre of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, towards whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything directly or indirectly tend, Old World or New.' ''Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality.' 'Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted.' 'But it is not on 'Leaves of Grass' distinctively as literature, that I feel to dwell or advance claims.

The bulk of the book will prove tedious to all except his admirers, and nothing that he might write will daunt this loyal band. Those who have established the cult of any author always go to the extreme of hero-worship. This is seen in the Browning societies of England and this country, and it finds equal expression in the Whitman coterie. The very uncouthness of Whitman appears to give pleasure to these people, and they are never tired of praising what has been called his 'heroic nudity.' In the first article in this volume, written at 70, Whitman attempts again to justify 'Leaves of Grass.' To use a phrase of Henry James, 'he regards himself too seriously,' and it makes one smile to read the frequent references to Goethe, Milton and other bards with whom Walt compares himself. What he says about his motive in writing this work which has called down on him so much orthodox condemnation is honestly and plainly stated, but we think he values the poem too highly and that it cannot in any sense be taken as the voice of a representative American of the latter half of this century. Whitman has always seemed very un-American in many of his traits, notably in his acceptance of gifts from friends and in his lack of ambition. That he has many genuine poetic ideas, even in his old age, is evident to any one who reads this collection of his later writings, but these ideas seldom find adequate expression. The mannerisms, both of his prose and his verse, check all perfect development, and one can only fancy what they might have been put in rhythmical verse or prose.

In this preface the author reaffirms himself, his poetic position, his heresies, his art theory, his democratic dreams: he stands or falls by 'Leaves of Grass,' and he denounces with a Shakspeare-like malediction all who would disturb the 'bones' of his work or who would fig-leaf or expurgate it. Whether his theory of verse-form be true or false, it finds its justification in the times, which demand something new, and has at least a foundation in the noble unmetered verse of the Bible.</p><p>Along with this 'Everlasting Yea' or chapter of re-affirmation go little singing essays and excerpts in marvellously nervous prose labelled with this or that title: 'The Bible as Poetry'; 'Father Taylor and Oratory'; 'A Word about Tennyson' (originally published in this journal, together with 'What Lurks behind Shakspeare's Historical Plays,' 'Five Thousand Poems', and 'Yonnondio'). The soul looks out through these jewelled eyes: they are windows of the poet's soul looking toward Jerusalem. Father Taylor moved the 'good gray poet' as no orator had ever done before. In the essay on 'Slang in America,' there is food for the philologist. The War memoranda and glimpses of hospital life contained in them are Tacitean2 in brevity and picturesqueness, everywhere quick and alive with pathos and pity. The woes of Andromache3 quail before these. It is this great fiery chasm of woe into which the artist looked for an instant, with all its Dantesque horror, and then, brooding over brotherhood, union, democracy, sang 'Leaves of Grass,' 'My Captain,' 'Calamus,' and all that me quoque which forms the essential germ of the Whitman gospel: egotism not as an abstraction but as an intensely concrete, kindled, personal necessity of modern democratic verse asserting itself triumphantly. Other blossoms of these November Boughs are 'Abraham Lincoln,' which is as beautiful as an epigram of Simonides;4 'New Orleans in 1848'; 'Last of the War Cases'; 'Elias Hicks'; and 'The Old Bowery.' The latter is a theatrical efflorescence: full of notes and historiettes of the magical times of the elder Booth, Charles Kean, Mario, Alboni, and the old Park Theatre: a 'bough' hung thick with leaf and fruit and clustering recollection.</p><p>On the whole, all these 'boughs' together make a very rich bouquet, tied at every twig with a love-knot for the reader, and full of the unction and eloquence of a most sweet personality.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217 November Boughs By Walt Whitman. $1.25.

Leaves of Grass has been chiefly the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature\u2014an attempt from first to last to put a Person, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, in America) freely, fully and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me.' In these words Walt Whitman gives us the true attitude we should adopt towards his work, having indeed a much saner view of the value and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisy detractors can boast of possessing. His last book, November Boughs as he calls it, published in the winter of the old man's life, reveals to us, not indeed a soul's tragedy, for its last note is one of joy and hope and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of such faith, but certainly the drama of a human soul, and puts on record with a simplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of his spiritual development and of the aim and motive both of the manner and the matter of his work. His strange mode of expression is shown in these pages to have been the result of deliberate and self-conscious choice. The 'barbaric yawp,' which he sent over 'the roofs of the world' so many years ago, and which wrung from Mr. Swinburne's lips such lofty panegyric in song and such loud clamorous censure in prose, appears here in what will be to many an entirely new light. For in his very rejection of art Walt Whitman is an artist. He tried to produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded. There is much method in what many have termed his madness, too much method indeed some may be tempted to fancy.</p><p>In the story of his life, as he tells it to us, we find him at the age of sixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature:\u2014</p><p>Summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island's seashores\u2014there in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb'd (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room\u2014it makes such difference where you read) Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, \u00c6schylus, Sophokles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindoo poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante's among them. As it happen'd I read the latter mostly in an old wood. The Iliad I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, north-east end of Long Island, in a sheltered hollow of rocks and sand, with the sea on each side. (I have wondered since why I was not overwhelmed by those mighty masters. Likely because I read them, as described, in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading landscapes and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p><p>Edgar Allan Poe's amusing bit of dogmatism that, for our occasions and for our day, there can be no such thing as a long poem, fascinated him: 'The same thought had been haunting my mind before,' he says, 'but Poe's argument, though short, work'd the sum out and proved it to me:' and the English translation of the Bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility of a poetic form which while retaining the spirit of poetry would still be free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system. Having thus to a certain degree settled upon what one might call the technique of Whitmanism, he began to brood upon the nature of that spirit that was to give life to the strange form. The central point of the poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily 'an identical body and soul,' a personality in fact, which personality he tells us frankly, 'after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself.' However for the true creation and revealing of this personality, at first only dimly felt, a new stimulus was needed. This came from the Civil War. After describing the many dreams and passions of his boyhood and early manhood he goes on to say:\u2014</p><p>These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught) if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national declamatory expression had not been given to me. It is certain, I say, that, although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what it showed me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous'd (of course, I don't mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in millions) that only from the strong flare and provocation of that war's sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth. I went down to the war-fields of Virginia, lived thenceforward in camp, saw great battles and the days and nights afterwards\u2014partook of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again aroused, courage evoked\u2014death readily risked\u2014the cause too\u2014along and filling those agonistic and lurid following years, the real parturition years of the henceforth homogeneous Union. Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave, 'Leaves of Grass' would not now be existing.</p><p>Having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening and awakening of the personal self, some day to be endowed with universality, he sought to find new notes of song, and passing beyond the mere passion for expression\u2014he aimed at 'Suggestiveness' first. 'I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme of thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought\u2014there to pursue your own flight.' Another 'impetus word' is Comradeship, and other 'word-signs' are Good Cheer, Content, and Hope. Individuality, especially, he sought for:\u2014</p><p>I have allowed the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist it\u2014not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as a counterpoise to the levelling tendencies of Democracy\u2014and for other reasons. Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant 'the great pride of a man in himself,' and permit it to be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>A new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes, conceived in a natural, simple, and healthy form, and he protests against poor Mr. William Rossetti's attempt to Bowdlerize and expurgate his song.</p><p>From another point of view 'Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex, and Amativeness, and even Animality\u2014though meanings that do not usually go with these words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted\u2026Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that 'heroic nudity' on which only a genuine diagnosis can be built. And in respect to editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as mine can do so, any elision of them.</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>But beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of a grand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence. 'I desired,' he says, 'to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should indirectly or directly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, or beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view of all, but of each.' His two final utterances are that really great poetry is always the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polished and select few; and that the sweetest and strongest songs yet remain to be sung.</p><p>Such are the views contained in the opening essay, 'A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads,' as he calls it: but there are many other essays in this fascinating volume, some on poets such as Burns and Lord Tennyson, for whom Walt Whitman has a profound admiration: some on old actors and singers, the elder Booth, Forrest, Alboni, and Mario being his special favourites: others on the native Indians, on the Spanish element in American nationality, on Western slang, on the poetry of the Bible, and on Abraham Lincoln. But Walt Whitman is at his best when he is analyzing his own work, and making schemes for the poetry of the future. Literature to him has a distinctly social aim. He seeks to build up the masses by 'building up grand individuals.' And yet literature itself must be preceded by noble forms of life. 'The best literature is always the result of something far greater than itself\u2014not the hero but the portrait of the hero. Before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction.' Certainly in Walt Whitman's views there is a largeness of vision, a healthy sanity, and a fine ethical purpose. He is not to be placed with the professional litt\u00e9rateurs of his country, Boston novelists, New York poets, and the like. He stands apart, and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy not in its performance. He has begun a prelude to larger themes. He is the herald to a new era. As a man he is the precursor of a fresh type. He is a factor in the heroic and spiritual evolution of the human being.

WALT WHITMAN calls his latest book November Boughs, and in more ways than one it testifies and it appeals beyond the letter to the reader's interest. For the poet the long fight is over; he rests his cause with what he has done; and we think no one now would like to consider the result without respect, without deference, even if one cannot approach it with entire submission. It is time, certainly, while such a poet is still with us, to own that his literary intention was as generous as his spirit was bold, and that if he has not accomplished all he intended, he has been a force that is by no means spent. Apart from the social import of his first book ('without yielding an inch, the working-man and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last'), he aimed in it at the emancipation of poetry from what he felt to be the trammels of rhyme and metre. He did not achieve this; but he produced a new kind in literature, which we may or may not allow to be poetry, but which we cannot deny is something eloquent, suggestive, moving, with a lawless, formless beauty of its own. He dealt literary conventionality one of those blows which eventually show as internal injuries, whatever the immediate effect seems to be. He made it possible for poetry hereafter to be more direct and natural than hitherto; the hearing which he has braved nearly half a century of contumely and mockery to win would now be granted on very different terms to a man of his greatness. This is always the way; and it is always the way that the reformer (perhaps in helpless confession of the weakness he shares with all humankind) champions some error which seems as dear to him as the truth he was born to proclaim. Walt Whitman was not the first to observe that we are all naked under our clothes, but he was one of the greatest, if not the first, to preach a gospel of nudity; not as one of his Quaker ancestry might have done for a witness against the spiritual nakedness of his hearers, but in celebration of the five senses and their equal origin with the three virtues of which the greatest is charity. His offence, if rank, is quantitatively small, a few lines at most; and it is one which the judicious pencil of the editor will some day remove for him, though for the present he 'takes occasion to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years.' We hope for that day, not only because it will give to all a kind in poetry which none can afford to ignore, and which his cherished lines bar to most of those who read most in our time and country, but because we think the five senses do not need any celebration. In that duality which every thoughtful person must have noticed composes him, we believe the universal experience is that the beast half from first to last is fully able to take care of itself. But it is a vast subject, and, as the poet says, 'it does not stand by itself; the vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance.' In the mean while we can assure the reader that these November Boughs are as innocent as so many sprays of apple blossom, and that he may take the book home without misgiving.</p><p>We think he will find in reading it that the prose passages are, some of them, more poetic than the most poetic of the rhythmical passages. 'Some War Memoranda,' and 'The Last of the War Cases'\u2014notes made twenty-five years ago\u2014are alive with a simple pathos and instinct with a love of truth which recall the best new Russian work, and which make the poet's psalms seem vague and thin as wandering smoke in comparison. Yet these have the beauty of undulant, sinuous, desultory smoke forms, and they sometimes take the light with a response of such color as dwells in autumn sunsets. The book is well named November Boughs: it is meditative and reminiscent, with a sober fragrance in it like the scent of fallen leaves in woods where the leaves that still linger overhead,</p><p>Or few, or none, do shake against the cold\u2014<br>Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.</p><p>It is the hymn of the runner resting after the race, and much the same as he chants always, whether the race has been lost or won.</p><p>[ . . .]</p>", "date": "February 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "William Dean Howells", "publication": "Harper's New Monthly Magazine", "citation": "Howells, William Dean [unsigned in original]. \"Editor's Study.\" February 1889.

The age of the poet (he was born in 1819), his infirmity, the suggestive title of the volume, and the character of its contents all indicate that it is the final word, the last farewell, of one who awaits death with the tranquil mind and the clear vision of the prophet.</p><p>Should the life of the poet be spared yet a few years he may, and doubtless will, add something to what now stands as the definitive expression of his thought\u2014a touch here or there, perhaps; a little added emphasis to some principle, an ultimate assertion of his steadfast faith in the creed which both his poetry and his life so nobly exemplify\u2014but the work itself is accomplished, his mission has been fulfilled, his burden has been delivered.</p><p>It is impossible to contemplate the life of this man, with a thorough knowledge of his work or even with an imperfect realization of it, without experiencing a feeling of profound and reverential respect. But we are too near him now to get other than an imperfect view of him; his personality is so great that it crowds the narrow field of our vision; to be adequately grasped and appreciated he must be seen in the perspective of at least one hundred years. His figure then will be sharply outlined against the background of history, and the future will see with unshaded eye and in a light softened and tempered by time that of which the present can get but a partial view.</p><p>It is a matter of no little significance that here has appeared in American literature a man who has had a burden, in the true sense of the word, to deliver. We have and have had poets of very respectable ability, but none of them has had other than an imaginary burden to deliver. They have sung, it is true, and sweetly, too, oftentimes, but they have not sung a new song. In analyzing their work it is easy to find close parallels in preceding literature; in searching for the source of the singer's inspiration it may be found almost always in his literary acquisitions, and the influence of this or that past master of song may be unerringly detected. In short, if their work were swept away we should lose little that is new\u2014nothing that could not be duplicated. But the work of Walt Whitman cannot be duplicated and it can be traced to no external source\u2014it springs directly from himself; it is his own, absolutely.</p><p>The simplicity of his life as a poet is comparable only to that of Washington as a commander, and his patriotism amounts to a religion. So impressed is he with the present grandeur, so confident is he of the ultimate triumph of democracy as it is organized in America, that he deems all conventional forms utterly inadequate to express the ideas which it suggests, the principles which it involves. Rhyme and rhythm, in the accepted sense, he discards as impracticable; the theme is too great; the mode of expression must be commensurate with the sublimity of the subject, a motive very different, be it remarked, from that which is commonly assigned as the reason for his rejection of established poetical forms\u2014the mere wanton rebelliousness of insufferable egotism.</p><p>True to his instinct of democracy, which illuminates every page he has written and which is the great life-giving principle of his poetry, Walt Whitman does not celebrate the great or the exceptional man, neither the medi\u00e6val prince nor the antique knight, or the hero of the olden time, but the average man of to-day. He celebrates not only his brain but his hands, not only his soul but also his body. He sings the praises of no individual but of the masses typified in this, to him, superb product, the average man. To him his land is a temple, the principles underlying his government are a religion\u2014his great voice fills the temple, but few hear it, for it sometimes occurs that those having ears do not hear.</p><p>Whatever was that old, old saying that prophet is not without honor save in his own country better exemplified than in the case of Walt Whitman. It would be superfluous to attempt to defend him from the ridicule and abuse to which he has been subjected by his countrymen. No defense is necessary, because such ridicule and abuse are the twin offspring of ignorance and stupidity. People who know absolutely nothing of his writing, either prose or verse, who have not read even 'O Captain, My Captain,' do not hesitate to assail him, to excoriate him, to blackguard him with a vehemence which is pitiful in that it reveals measureless, fathomless depths of ignorance. Others from less unworthy motives have made an outcry on the score of outraged decency, but the one page in all of Walt Whitman's works which may be objected to on this ground is part and parcel of his doctrine\u2014is vital, in fact\u2014and to question the intellectual honesty of the poet on account of it is simply monstrous.</p><p>It is humiliating but true that the recognition which is denied Walt Whitman at home is cheerfully and enthusiastically accorded him abroad. The fact that he is so recognized abroad in no way influences his enemies at home, for the reason that his detractors are of that class who cherish the absurd delusion that the inhabitants of London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome, and the lands which these cities represent, are a weary, dreary, unlucky lot of people who despise their respective countries and to whom life is desperately empty, vapid, and inept. The idea that America is the only place on the face of the earth that is fit to live in, not only for Americans, but also for a Frenchman, an Englishman, or a German, is one of those ridiculous illusions which, of course, the kindly hand of time will eventually dispel.</p><p>Naturally the fullest measure of recognition abroad is found in England, where were it not for the stumbling-block of Walt Whitman's departure from established models, Mr. Edmund Gosse would not have propounded the question 'Has America produced a great poet?' Both the prose and verse of Whitman have long excited the liveliest interest in England, especially among critical and literary people. Even such a master of technique as Swinburne extends the hand of fellowship to Walt Whitman. In his 'Song to Walt Whitman, in America,' beginning\u2014</p><p>'Send but a song over sea to us,<br>Heart of their hearts who are free'\u2014</p><p>occurs in this stanza:</p><p>'O strong-winged soul with prophetic<br>Lips hot with the blood-beats of song,<br>With tremor of heart-strings magnetic,<br>With thoughts as thunders in throng,<br>With consonant ardors of chords<br>That pierce men's souls as with swords<br>And hale them hearing along,<br>Make us too music\u2014'</p><p>Prof. Clifford, Prof. Tyrrell, and other eminent critics have recognized the great significance of his work, while Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in a prefatory notice to a volume of selections from his works, which he has edited, says: 'There is in his poems a singular interchange of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While he sees men with even abnormal exactness as men, he sees them also 'as trees walking,' and admits us to perceive that the whole show is, in a measure, spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and profounder reality beneath it, of which it is giving perpetual intimations and auguries.' In regard to the title of Walt Whitman's more important volume, Mr. Rossetti observes: 'Leaves of Grass' seems to express with some aptness the simplicity, universality, and spontaneity of the poems to which it is applied.'</p><p>In his 'Studies in Literature' Prof. Dowden devotes a chapter to the poetry of Walt Whitman. In 1876 Robert Buchanan, the Scotch poet, published an appeal 'eulogizing and defending the American bard in his old age, illness, and poverty from the swarms of maligners who still continue to assail him.' The appeal contains this passage:</p><p>'He who wanders through the solitudes of far-off Uist or lonely Donegal may often behold the golden eagle sick to death, worn with age or famine, or with both, passing with weary waft of wing from promontory to promontory, from peak to peak, pursued by a crowd of rooks and crows which fall back screaming whenever the noble bird turns his indignant head, and which follow frantically once more, hooting behind him, whenever he wends again upon his way.'</p><p>A Danish critic has said in a Copenhagen magazine:</p><p>'It may be candidly admitted that the American poet has not the elegance, special melody, nor recherche aroma of the accepted poets of Europe or his own country, but his compass and general harmony are infinitely greater. The sweetness and spice, the poetic ennui, the tender longings, the exquisite art finish of these choice poets are mainly unmet and unseen in him\u2014perhaps because he cannot achieve them\u2014more likely because he disdains them. But there is an electric living soul in his poetry far more fermenting and bracing. His wings do not glitter in their movement from rich and varicolored plumage, nor are his notes those of the accustomed song-birds, but his flight is the flight of the eagle.'</p><p>A writer in the French Revue des Deux Mondes has pronounced his war poems, 'the most vivid the most humanly passionate, and the most modern of all the verse of the nineteenth century.' While the German poet Freiligrath, who has translated him into German, hails him as the 'founder of a new democratic and modern order of poetry greater than the old.'</p><p>But Walt Whitman is not without his friends in America, and among them is that charming writer, John Burroughs, who says of his poetry:</p><p>'His lines are pulsations, thrills, waves of force, indefinite dynamics, formless, constantly emanating from the living center, and they carry the quality of the author's personal presence with them in a way that is unprecedented in literature.'</p><p>The last volume of the poet's works, 'November Boughs' (Philadelphia: David McKay), contains more prose than verse. It opens with an essay entitled 'A Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads,' in which the poet reviews his poems 'in the light of their own intentions, with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody.'</p><p>Nothing could be more admirable than Walt Whitman's prose style; vigorous, luminous, and picturesque as it is, he well deserves the reputation that he has won in England of having written some of the best prose of the century. In these 'Backward Glances' he refers frequently to 'Leaves of Grass.' For grounds for 'Leaves of Grass' he says:</p><p>'As a poem, I abandoned the conventional themes which do not appear in it. None of the stock ornamentation, or choice plots of love or war, or high, exceptional personages of old-world song; nothing, as I may say, for beauty's sake\u2014no legend, or myth, or romance, nor euphemism, nor rhyme. But the broadest average of humanity and its identities in the now ripening nineteenth century, and especially in each of their countless examples and practical occupations in the United States to-day. \u2217\u2217\u2217 Few appreciate the moral revolutions, our age, which have been profounder far than the material or inventive or war-produced ones. The nineteenth century now well toward its close (and ripening into fruit the seeds of the two preceding centuries)\u2014the uprising of national masses and shifting of boundary lines\u2014the historical and other prominent facts of the United States\u2014the war of attempted secession\u2014the stormy rush and haste of nebulous forces\u2014never can future years witness more excitement and din of action\u2014never completer change of army-front along the whole line, the whole civilized world. For all these new and evolutionary facts, meanings, purposes, new poetic messages, new forms and expressions, are inevitable. \u2217\u2217\u2217 Without yielding an inch the workingman and the working woman were to be in my pages from first to last. The ranges of heroism and loftiness with which Greek and feudal poets endow'd their god-like or lordly born characters\u2014indeed, prouder and better based and with fuller ranges than those\u2014I was to endow the democratic averages of America. I was to show that we, here and to-day, are eligible to the grandest and the best\u2014more eligible now than any times of old were. I will also want my utterances to be in spirit poems of the morning. I will want them to be the poems of women entirely as much as men. I have wished to put the complete union of the states in my songs without any preference or partiality whatever. Henceforth, if they live and are read, it must be just as much south as north, just as much along the Pacific as Atlantic, in the valley of the Mississippi, in Canada, up in Maine, down in Texas, on the shores of Puget sound.'</p><p>After these 'Backward Glances' comes 'Sands at Seventy'\u2014a collection of short fugitive poems. These are followed by an admirable essay on 'Our Eminent Visitors\u2014Past, Present, and Future,' in which all\u2014Dickens, Thackeray, Froude, Spenser, Wilde, Coleridge, Matthew Arnold, Irving\u2014are welcomed 'in the whole land's name,' but they are warned that in meeting and surveying 'the etiquettical gatherings of our wealthy, distinguish'd, and sure-to-be-put-forward-on-such-occasions citizens' in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, etc., that in passing through one after another, 'the full-dress coteries of the Atlantic cities, all grammatical, cultured, and correct with the toned-down manners of the gentlemen, and the kid gloves and luncheons and finger-glasses\u2014let not our eminent visitors, we say, suppose that by means of these experiences they have 'seen America' or captured any distinctive clew or purport thereof. Of the pulse-beats that lie within and vitalize this commonweal of to-day, of the hard-pan purports and idiosyncrasies pursued faithfully and triumphantly, by its bulk of men north and south, generation after generation\u2014those coteries do not furnish the faintest scintilla.'</p><p>Then, after several more short essays, including 'The Bible as Poetry,' 'What Lurks Behind Shakspere's Plays,' 'Robert Burns as Poet and Person,' comes 'A Word About Tennyson' And here a word must be said about Walt Whitman's attitude toward the poetry of the past and toward European, particularly English, poetry of to-day. That attitude is by no means revolutionary. Although he has nothing in common with his brother poets so far as matters of form are concerned, he recognizes most generously and appreciates most fully the beauty and the strength of their art products. In the 'Backward Glances' he says: 'The new world receives with joy the poems of the antique, with European feudalism's rich fund of epics, plays, ballads\u2014seeks not in the least to deaden or displace those voices from our ear and area\u2014holds them, indeed, as indispensable studies, influences, records, comparisons.' But, although he calls them the 'most precious bequest to current American civilization from all the hitherto ages,' he asks:</p><p>'Of the great poems receiv'd from abroad and from the ages and to-day enveloping and penetrating America, is there one that is consistent with these United States or essentially applicable to them as they are and are to be? Is there one whose underlying basis is not a denial and insult to democracy? \u2217\u2217\u2217 I have, indeed, put on record elsewhere my reverence and eulogy for those never-to-be-excell'd poetic bequests and their indescribable preciousness as heirlooms for America. Another and separate point must now be candidly stated. If I had not stood before those poems with uncovered head, fully aware of their colossal grandeur and beauty of form and spirit, I could not have written 'Leaves of Grass.' My verdict and conclusions, as illustrated in its pages, are arrived at through the temper and inculcation of the old works as much as through anything else. As America, fully and fairly construed, is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse. Without stopping to qualify the averment, the old world has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great; but the new world needs the poems of realities and science and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the center of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, toward whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything else directly or indirectly tend, old world or new.'</p><p>In the light of this comprehensive exposition of the poet's attitude one is prepared to read intelligently the following paragraph in 'A Word About Tennyson':</p><p>'Let me assume to pass Verdict, or perhaps momentary judgment, for the United States on this poet\u2014a removed and distant position giving some advantages over a nigh one. What is Tennyson's service to his race, times, and especially to America? First I should say\u2014or at least, nor forget\u2014his personal character. He is not to be mentioned as a rugged, evolutionary, aboriginal force\u2014but (and a great lesson is in it) he has been consistent throughout with the native, healthy, patriotic spinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and conventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflected the upper-crust of his time, its pale cast of thought, even its ennui. Then the simile of my friend, John Burroughs, is entirely true, 'his glove is a glove of silk, but the hand is a hand of iron.' He shows how one can be a poet laureate, quite elegant and 'aristocratic,' and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his non-democracy, it fits him well and I like him the better for it. I guess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those sides of a thought, or possibility, different from our own\u2014different and yet with a sort of home likeness\u2014a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from tastes and proclivities not at all his own. To me, Tennyson shows more than any poet I know (perhaps has been a warning to me) how much there is in finest verbalism. There is such a latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions, and in the voice ringing them, which he has caught and brought out, beyond all others\u2014as in the line,</p><p>''And hollow, hollow, hollow, all delight,'</p><p>in the 'Passing of Arthur,' and evidenced in 'The Lady of Shalott,' and many other pieces. His mannerism is very great, but it is a noble and welcome mannerism. His very best work, to me, is contained in the books of 'The Idyls of the King,' and all that has grown out of them. Though indeed we could spare nothing of Tennyson however small or however peculiar\u2014not 'Break, Break,' nor 'Flower in the Crannied Wall,' nor the old and eternally told passion of 'Edward Gray.'</p><p>It is a rising, not a setting, sun that bursts through these 'November Boughs'; how, in its intense and all-pervading light, the glowworm-like phases of literary activity-particularly in the way of fiction, the all-absorbing discussion of which is just now the passing 'fashionable fad'\u2014pale their ineffectual fires.</p>", "date": "February 9 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Daily News", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman's Latest Work.\" 9 February 1889.

(Alexander Gardner.)</p><p>To persons who are not already well-disposed toward Walt Whitman and his work, this collection of November Boughs offers little to attract and at the same time little to repel. It seems to be hardly intended for such persons at all. Those who have not discovered what may be termed the secret of Whitman in Leaves of Grass and in Democratic Vistas are not likely to discover it in the pages of this new volume; and impartial students, who wish to judge for themselves, must still be referred to the author's earlier writings.</p><p>Yet to persons\u2014and they are many now\u2014who are already well-disposed toward Walt Whitman and his work, the volume will be welcome. It will please and interest them as the later expression of a man whom they admire. It consists for the most part of fugitive pieces in prose and in verse, some gathered from magazines, others printed now for the first time. Readers in England have seen several of them in the convenient 'Camelot' volume published last year and reviewed at the time in the ACADEMY. Two prose pieces which appeared there under the titles 'My Book and I' and 'How I made a Book' are now brought together and newly entitled\u2014'A Backward Glance o'er Travell'd Roads.' The papers on Shakspeare, on Burns as Poet and Person, and on Tennyson, also reappear; but most of the other contents of the book are not so familiar. There is an interesting reminiscence of Father Taylor, who, though 'an orthodox minister of no particular celebrity, who, during a long life, preached especially to Yankee sailors in an old fourth-class church down by the wharves of Boston,' was, in the opinion of Walt Whitman, 'the only essentially perfect orator' he ever heard. Interesting, also, are the somewhat fuller notes on another famous preacher\u2014Elias Hicks. Whitman's parents were 'Hicksite' Quakers; and Whitman himself, in his early days, saw something of the great Quaker heretic, and derived therefrom deep and lasting impressions. He traces a resemblance between Elias Hicks and Father Taylor:</p><p>'Years afterward, in Boston, I heard Father Taylor, the sailor's preacher, and found in his passionate, unstudied oratory the resemblance to Elias Hicks's\u2014not argumentative or intellectual, but so penetrating\u2014so different from anything in the books (different as the fresh air of a May morning, or seashore breeze, from the atmosphere of a perfumer's shop)' (p. 128). Of Elias Hicks himself, Walt Whitman writes:</p><p>'The true Christian religion (such was the teaching of Elias Hicks) consists neither in rights, or Bibles, or sermons, or Sundays\u2014but in noiseless secret ecstasy and unremitted aspiration, in purity, in a good practical life, in charity to the poor and toleration to all. He said, 'A man may keep the Sabbath, may belong to a church and attend all the observances, have regular family prayer, keep a well-bound copy of the Hebrew scriptures in a conspicuous place in his house, and yet not be a truly religious person at all.' E. believ'd little in a church as organiz'd\u2014even his own\u2014with houses, ministers, or with salaries, creeds, Sundays, saints, Bibles, holy festivals, &c. But he believ'd always in the universal Church, in the soul of man, invisibly rapt, ever waiting, ever responding to universal truths. He was fond of pithy proverbs. He said, 'It matters not where you live, but how you live.' He said once to my father, 'They talk of the devil\u2014I tell thee, Walter, there is no worse devil than man'' (pp. 128-9).</p><p>A man like this was a man after Walt Whitman's own heart.</p><p>The poetical pieces\u2014in the old familiar form\u2014are of varying merit. There is a vivid descriptive touch in that on 'Broadway':</p><p>'What hurrying human tides, or day or night!<br>What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim <br>thy waters!<br>What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!<br>What curious questioning glances\u2014glints of love!<br>Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!<br>Thou portal\u2014thou arena\u2014thou of the myriad <br>long drawn lines and groups!<br>(Could but thy flagstones, curbs, fa\u00e7ades, tell <br>their inimitable tales;<br>Thy windows rich, and huge hotels\u2014thy side\u2014 <br>walks wide):<br>Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling <br>feet!<br>Thou, like the parti-coloured world itself\u2014like <br>infinite, teeming, mocking life!<br>Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and <br>lesson!' (p. 28.)</p><p>Two lines called 'The Bravest Soldiers' are characteristic:</p><p>'Brave, brave were the soldiers (high named to-<br>day) who lived through the fight;<br>But the bravest pressed to the front, and fell, <br>unnamed, unknown' (p. 20).</p><p>Yet, after all, that is only partly true; even some who pressed to the front may not have fallen. I think few persons\u2014however they may object to some of his methods\u2014would deny the bravery of the 'good grey poet' himself, yet happily he has not fallen, but has lived to celebrate his triumph. His purpose has been achieved. I do not mean that he has converted the world, or that he has vanquished all ill-will; but he has compelled attention and has won regard. He is no longer scorned or laughed at. He has even achieved such respectability that in some newspapers he is called 'Mr.' Whitman\u2014a form of respect which, I fear, he does not duly appreciate. Nay, more! Mr. Swinburne, who has a genius for saying things out of due season, has abused him. And all this has been secured without compromise on Whitman's part. He has abandoned nothing, and may therefore enjoy his triumph without regret of any kind. Old age has come upon him, it is true, and with it increasing bodily infirmities. An occasional undertone of sadness in the present volume points to this. But, for the most part, we see in these pages the same hopeful, cheery, affectionate, and great-souled man and poet, whom we have known so long. Old age has not touched his heart, and it is impossible to believe that it ever will.</p><p>WALTER LEWIN.</p>", "date": "February 23 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "Walter Lewin", "publication": "The Academy", "citation": "Lewin, Walter. \"[Review of November Boughs].\" 23 February 1889.

To the people who live in the appearances of things, to the people who love shams and conventions, to the people who worship the isms which the past has bequeathed, Whitman has no message to convey. He does not live in the trim little parterre which human genius has reduced to order, he is a portion of the great unconquered chaos that surrounds us here, there, and everywhere. His voice comes far away from the distance. You have to pause to listen, and are not always sure you have heard aright, but somehow you feel that the very Distance is the truest part of yourself, and that the far-off voice reveals to you the deeps of your own soul. The things you have vaguely felt are here uttered, and then for the first time perhaps you recognize that you have felt them. Whitman himself tells us in his excellent preliminary essay 'A Backward Glance o'er Travelled Roads' that the word he would put primarily for the description of his Leaves of Grass is the word Suggestiveness. 'I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought, - there to pursue your own flight.' But the most characteristic and illuminating passage in this essay is where Whitman tells us, 'Ever since what might be call'd thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance ('to justify the ways of God to man' is Milton's well-known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones; to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view of all, but of each. While I can not understand it or argue it out, I fully believe in a clue and purpose in Nature, entire and several; and that invisible spiritual results, just as real and definite as the visible, eventuate all concrete life and all materialism, through Time. My book ought to emanate buoyancy and gladness legitimately enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.'</p>", "date": "March 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "William S.

Walt Whitman's 'November Boughs' has a streak of intentional verse in it, but the prose papers of which it is mainly composed speak aloud of the peculiar poetic temperament behind them. We look at various subjects through the good poet's eyes: at 'Our Eminent Visitors, past, present, and future,'\u2014a brilliant motley procession,\u2014Dickens, Thackeray, Spencer, Oscar Wilde, Matthew Arnold, Henry Irving; at 'The Bible as Poetry;' 'A Word about Tennyson;' 'Slang in America;' 'Father Taylor and Oratory;' 'What lurks behind Shakespeare's Historical Plays;' or at some jottings of personal reminiscence,\u2014'War Memoranda,' 'Notes on Elias Hicks,' etc.; in each we gain a large, though brief and passing, glimpse of the subject viewed; from each some added impression of the breadth, the democratic kindliness, and homespun sense that marks the very soul and gait of our American Walt Whitman.</p><p>Very readable papers are these, but not only for their own sakes.

It tells plainly much of that which we can scarcely imagine any intelligent reader of poetry would let pass by unread and unheeded. In the verses given and entitled 'Sands at Seventy' we would choose out 'Had I the Choice,' 'You Tides with Ceaseless Swell,' 'Proudly the Flood comes in,' and 'By that Long Scan of Waves,' as telling the same story in Whitman's best way,\u2014the story of the part he has distinctively chosen to uphold amid the democratic flood of peoples that he loves.</p><p>He tells it to much the same effect and more specifically in the introductory paper from which we extract this comment on his own 'Leaves of Grass' and other poems:</p><p>'The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last is the word Suggestiveness.

I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me.

Most of it is prose\u2014to anticipate the rather superfluous and stale jibes on the subject, let us say intentional prose\u2014and the small section which is not contains nothing aggressive. Most of it is, again, a mere collection of the casual articles for newspapers and magazines by which the author is known to eke out his means of subsistence. Only in the first article, perhaps, which is a kind of review or reflection upon his own literary history, does Walt Whitman make much addition to his characteristic work; and this is not in the least combative. On the contrary, it seems to us to be singularly modest\u2014not at all with the sham modesty which a vain old man who is proud of what he has done sometimes affects. Mr. Whitman says, in a manner which, if irony were not a mode rather foreign to him, we should consider ironical, that 'William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke are much more peremptory' in estimating his value than he is. We should be very much surprised if they were not. William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke (we use these names with all apologies to the eminent possessors, of whom we know very little, as types) usually are 'more peremptory,' and may usually be neglected. We have no concern with William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke. If we have concern with Mr. Whitman (he would not like to be called Mr., but he has done what he likes himself for the most part, and we shall imitate him), it is less with this particular little volume than with his whole work. That work, or rather the important part of it\u2014for little that has appeared since makes much difference\u2014was reviewed in the earliest days of the Saturday Review by a very eminent hand. We shall not say that it was unjustly reviewed, nor do we think so. From certain points of view Walt Whitman deliberately laid himself open to what he has abundantly received\u2014the process technically known as 'slating.' If a man will, by no means without truth, announce his completed intention of emitting a 'barbaric yawp,' he must reckon with the expression of the sentiments of persons who do not like barbaric yawps. If he will, in season and out of season, praise an irrational variety of polity, which has never yet been tried with real success in any age of the world's history, he must lay his account with harsh answers from people who utterly decline to sacrifice the freedom of forty-nine wise men to the tyranny of fifty-one fools. If he chooses to dilate on subjects which the world usually keeps sub rosa, for many wise reasons\u2014not the least wise being that they lose half their charm and interest if the Rose presides not at the discussion of them\u2014here, too, he must take the consequences. If, desiring to be new, he rushes to cheap and obvious ways of being, not new, but merely novel, employs a grotesque vocabulary, and discards the ornaments of rhyme and of recognized verse, he cannot eat the cake of eccentricity and yet have that of classic recognition. And we conceive that a critic has a right, if he likes, to visit all these provoked consequences on the provoker's head, whatever William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke may say. We must repeat that it does not in the least matter what they do say. The whole tale of this new 'Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads' amounts to an acknowledgment by Walt Whitman himself, not that his critics were right\u2014very far from that\u2014but that he had nothing else to expect. Of course he reiterates\u2014not vehemently, as of old, but vigorously enough\u2014his standard doctrines that democratic America wants something newer and better than the old poetry, and that his poetry is not an achievement (William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke say that), but an experiment in the way of giving a new form to democratic America. There are even faint glimpses (though he seems to recoil from them with horror, and says 'Great is democratic America!' as his new Om-mani-padmi-hom, many times to wash himself clean of the fact of sin) that 'modern science and democracy appear to be eliminating something that gives the last majesty to man.'</p><p>Now it seems to us that Walt Whitman's unfavourable critics hitherto have rather failed to distinguish between the faults which false premises to start from and a misconceived aim to tend to have produced in him on the one side, and the faculties, and even to a certain extent the accomplishments as a poet, which in spite of all these evil influences he has displayed on the other. It is very rare, indeed, to find an admirer of his who does not sympathize with some, at least, of his principles; it is almost an unknown thing to find a critic who dislikes him, and whose dislike is not based either on dislike of his political, religious, and moral standpoints, or else on an unwillingness to admit the 'barbaric yawp' because there is so much yawp in it, and it is so barbaric. Yet this is certainly wrong, nor is it quite universal. We, for instance, who write here to-day willingly make a present of almost every general principle of his to the enemy to be given up to chaos and old night. So far is it from being the case that the United States of America present a higher type of civilization and of humanity, that we should count the grey New Yorker rather lower than the European child. Democracy, instead of being a great and beautiful goddess, is a dirty, half-witted trull. Instead of its being a good thing to do as Whitman has tried to do, to put a person fully, freely, and truly on record, the first and the last rule of the poet should be, not indeed to work impersonally, but to pass every personal emotion through the sieve of the universal, to 'disrealize' everything, to bring it into union with the whole. We hold that, whether it is desirable or not to say to 'the perfect girl who understands you' the things that Whitman says, it is infinitely better not to shout such conversation on the housetops; that to talk about 'me imperturbe' is silly, not impressive; that rhythmical staves of prose are infinitely more difficult, as well as much more rarely effective, than the common rhyme-assisted measures, and so forth. All this is granted by us, or rather spontaneously asserted, and if William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke do not like it, we cannot help that. And then we face round, and ask simply whether this is not poetry?\u2014</p><p>Come, lovely and soothing Death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate Death.</p><p>Praised be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;<br>And for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death.</p><p>Dark Mother! always gliding near, with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee\u2014I glorify thee above all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.</p><p>Approach, strong Deliveress!<br>When it is so\u2014when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,<br>Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,<br>Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death!</p><p>From me to thee glad serenades,<br>Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee\u2014adornments and feastings for <br>thee;<br>And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are <br>fitting,<br>And life, and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.</p><p>The night, in silence, under many a star;<br>The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know;<br>And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veiled Death!<br>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.</p><p>Over the tree-tops I float thee a song!<br>Over the rising and sinking waves\u2014over the myriad fields and the prairies <br>wide:<br>Over the dense-packed cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,<br>I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death!</p><p>This exquisite poem\u2014for we do not hesitate to call it so\u2014was indeed not in the original 'Leaves of Grass,' as it appeared more than thirty years ago, nor were the 'Sea-shore Memories,' the next best thing that Whitman has done. But the quality, less conspicuously present and alloyed with much more base matter, is almost everywhere. That the alloy is almost everywhere, also, is perfectly true. But, when we are asked whether soil is auriferous or not, we do not pause to inquire whether it is nothing but auriferous. It may be annoying enough to come, after such a passage, upon such another as this:\u2014'Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning in at night.' But for what was the divine art of skipping created, if a reader is not able to dodge things like this, and to go straight to others which the theory of poetry (and of common sense) will allow?</p><p>We cannot, for our part, conceive any theory of poetry which shall shut out stuff such as the Death Carol, because it is not in any of 'the four-and-twenty measures,' as Welsh critics say, or because it finds itself in the company of unwise laudations of a (to speak mildly) imperfect state of politics and manners, unwise excursions into tacenda, unwise catalogues of names and trades, and other unwisdoms not a few.</p><p>No; let us, if it be ours to lecture on poetry, hold up Walt Whitman as much as any one pleases for an awful example of the fate that waits, and justly waits, on those who think (idle souls!) that there is such a thing as progress in poetry, and that because you have steam-engines and other things which Solomon and Sappho had not, you may, nay must, neglect the lessons of Sappho and Solomon. But let us none the less confess that this strayed reveller, this dubiously well-bred truant in poetry, is a poet still, and one of the remarkably few poets that his own country has produced.</p><p>\u2217 November Boughs.

The public has been slow to recognize the power and value of his work, but no public, possessed of any degree of intelligence, could long hold out against the verdict rendered in his favor by the consensus of English and American critics. No writer of ordinary powers could win the approval and praise of such men (to name but a few) as Tennyson, Swinburne, W. M. Rossetti, J. A. Symonds and E. C. Stedman, and this praise and this approval have been bestowed by them in generous measure. It will appear then, at the present day, neither paradox nor extravagance to say that 'November Boughs' (Philadelphia: David McKay) is an important permanent contribution to American literature.</p><p>The contents of this suggestively named volume are diversified. There are some twenty pages of poems, half a dozen essays in literary criticism, several miscellaneous prose papers, and much fragmentary reminiscence of a varied and well-spent life. Of most interest, perhaps, is the 'Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads,' which serves as the volume's preface. In this admirable paper the veteran poet, with the objective vision of age, takes a long retrospective survey of his activities, admitting the reader more closely than before into the secret of his endeavor, and giving clear and forcible expression to the aims for whose accomplishment he has striven. 'At the age of 31 to 33,' he tell us, he found himself possessed by an overmastering impulse. 'This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary and poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, emotional, moral, intellectual and esthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current America\u2014and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date, in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book.' The outcome of this ambition was the collection of pieces known collectively as 'Leaves of Grass' and the prose papers also put forth from time to time. 'The best comfort of the whole business is that, unstopp'd and unwarped by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record.' This is what he tells us, with a pride as pardonable as the occasion for its exhibition is rare even among writers of more than usual sincerity and earnestness of purpose. In another place the feeling of pride leads to this exclamation: 'My Book and I\u2014what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to 1880\u2014and America in them! Proud, proud indeed may we be if we have culled enough of that period in its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it to the future!'</p><p>Upon the two matters in which Whitman's work has mainly given offence\u2014its disregard respectively of the conventional requirements of morality and of literary form\u2014this introduction is clear and outspoken. Concerning the latter of these matters we read: 'I know well enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not only the divine works, that to-day stand ahead in the world's reading, but dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done or could do. But it seemed to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of estheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and important, of their point of view, the time had come to reflect all themes and things, old and new, in the lights thrown on them by the advent of America and democracy\u2014to chant those themes through the utterance of one not only the grateful and reverent legatee of the past, but the born child of the New World\u2014to illustrate all through the genesis and ensemble of to-day; and that such illustration and ensemble are the chief demands of America's prospective imaginative literature.' While this plea may by no means be accepted as justifying Whitman's literary form, which has faults of which his defective sense does not allow him to dream, it is valuable as a statement of his aim in writing, and for its hearty recognition of the conventional types of excellence in literary composition. This recognition, indeed, finds further and ample expression in the papers on Tennyson, Burns and Shakspeare which are given in the present volume. Of the real purpose of literature, whether conventional or not in form, Whitman is substantially at one with all the great writers from Shakspeare downwards. 'I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect or supply something polished and interesting, nor even to depict great passions or persons and events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him good heart as a radical possession and habit.' These words are as noble as they are profoundly true.</p><p>The other matter, brought into prominence by the moralists, who have made themselves mainly responsible for the tardiness of the recognition bestowed upon Whitman's work, is thus met, and the opinion is enforced by years of careful reflection. 'From another point of view, 'Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality\u2014though meanings that do not usually go along with these words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women toward the thought and fact of sexuality as an element in character, personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. . . . In respect to editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such), I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and I hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do, any elision of them.'</p><p>The few pages of poetry included within this volume should be reckoned with Whitman's most remarkable work. They exhibit, of course, the peculiarities of diction and the general formlessness of the 'Leaves of Grass.' The reader who is not prepared to accept the writer's theories, or, rather, who is not willing to acquiesce in them for the time being, will not be appealed to by these 'Sands at Seventy.' Admitting the peculiarities as a constant and consistent factor, there is much that is both striking and fine. Take, for example, this epigram on 'The Bravest Soldiers:'</p><p>'Brave, brave were the soldiers (high-named to-day) who lived through the night;<br>But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, unkown.'</p><p>Here is a touch of nature that is admirable in its thought and feeling:</p><p>'Simple and fresh and fair from Winter's close emerging,<br>As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics, had ever been.<br>Forth from its sunny nook of shelter'd grass\u2014innocent, golden, calm as the dawn,<br>The Spring's first dandelion shows its trustful face.'</p><p>The following fragment is based upon an incident of the Greely expedition\u2014the hearing of a solitary snow-bird's song by the explorers in 83 degrees of north latitude:</p><p>'Of that blithe throat of thine from Arctic bleak and blank,<br>I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird\u2014let me, too, welcome chilling drifts,<br>E'en the profoundest chill, as now\u2014a torpid pulse, a brain unnerv'd,<br>Old age land-lock'd within its Winter bay\u2014(cold, cold, O cold!)<br>These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my frozen feet,<br>For them thy faith, thy role I take, and grave it to the last;<br>Not summer's zones alone\u2014not chants of youth, or south's warm tides alone,<br>But held by sluggish toes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus of years,<br>These with gay heart I also sing.'</p><p>There is something haunting about these lines, with whatever species of composition we may choose to class them, and this haunting quality appears upon every one of the too few pages which contain the poet's latest songs. At his best, Whitman has a genius for style and for apt expression of thought which allies him with the greater poets and insures for him the recognition and the respect of the future.</p>", "date": "March 16 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "W.

Indeed, paradoxical as the statement may seem, a sense of fitness is the predominant impression remaining from the study of Whitman's work, and this in spite of its indefensible rhythmic and verbal vagaries. It is the fitness, in the large sense, of thought and language to the character and mood of the writer. 'Unstopp'd and unwarp'd by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record'\u2014this is what Whitman tells us in the 'Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads' which prefaces the new volume. The absolute honesty of his work, coupled with the genius for style which it displays, ensure for it both permanence of influence and the respectful consideration of future years. Enlarge upon its faults as we may, the work still has rare qualities of power and beauty which it takes no extended search to discover. Let us quote the two poems entitled 'Halcyon Days' and 'Queries to my Seventieth Year.' He must be dull of soul who has no sense of the beauty of the one or the power of the other.</p><p>'Not from successful love alone,<br>Nor wealth, nor honor'd middle age, nor victories of <br>politics or war;<br>But as life wanes, and all the turbulent passions calm,<br>As gorgeous, vapory, silent hues cover the evening sky,<br>As softness, fulness, rest, suffuse the frame, like fresher, <br>balmier air,<br>As the days take on a mellower light, and the apple at <br>last hangs really finish'd and indolent-ripe on the <br>tree,<br>Then for the teeming quietest, happiest days of all!<br>The brooding and blissful halcyon days.'</p><p>It is the reverse of the shield that comes to view in the other poem:</p><p>'Approaching, nearing, curious,<br>Thou dim, uncertain spectre\u2014bringest thou life or <br>death?<br>Strength, weakness, blindness, more paralysis and <br>heavier?<br>Or placid skies and sun? Wilt stir the waters yet?<br>Or haply cut me short for good? Or leave me here as <br>now,<br>Dull, parrot-like and old, with crack'd voice harping, <br>screeching?'</p><p>The poems in this volume fill but a score of pages, but every page has its charm. Upon one we find this faultless epigram on 'The Bravest Soldiers':</p><p>'Brave, brave were the soldiers (high named to-day) <br>who lived through the fight;<br>But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, <br>unknown.'</p><p>Upon another we are greeted with this word for Lincoln's birthday:</p><p>'To-day, from each and all, a breath of prayer\u2014a pulse <br>of thought,<br>To memory of Him\u2014to birth of Him.'</p><p>Still another gives us this picture of the resurrection that comes with the springtide:</p><p>'Then shalt perceive the simple shows, the delicate <br>miracles of earth,<br>Dandelion, clover, the emerald grass, the early scents <br>and flowers,<br>The arbutus under foot, the willow's yellow-green, the <br>blossoming plum and cherry;<br>With these the robin, lark, and thrush, singing their<br> songs\u2014the flitting bluebird;<br>For such the scenes the annual play brings on.'</p><p>We find verses like these, scattered in rich profusion through the songs:</p><p>'Possess'd by some strange spirit of fire.'</p><p>'With husky-haughty lips, O sea!<br>Where day and night I wend thy surf-beat shore.'</p>'Old age land-lock'd within its winter bay.'<p>'Isle of the salty shore, and breeze, and brine.'</p><p>It is the very magic of style that informs these lines. For the rest, these 'Sands at Seventy' contain no word that is objectionable as certain passages of the 'Leaves of Grass' were objectionable. Nor do we find in them the violent distortion of speech\u2014the 'barbaric yawp,'\u2014or the endless catalogues of attributes and things which made the poet's earlier work \u00e6sthetically offensive. Of the prose work which makes up the greater part of the volume, this is not the place to speak at length, and we will only remark that much of it seems to us as suggestive and beautiful as the poetry. The writer takes occasion, in his preface, to justify the passages in the 'Leaves of Grass' which have been the subject of so much discussion, and 'to confirm these lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years.'</p><p>[ . . .]</p>", "date": "April 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "William Morton Payne", "publication": "The Dial", "citation": "Payne, William Morton [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of November Boughs].\" April 1889.

The author himself (as he expresses it) 'like a dismasted ship,' lying at Camden, New Jersey\u2014occupying the brief remainder of his time, and the intervals of physical prostration and illness, with last editions of, and additions to, his works. ('Just now I am finishing a big volume of about 900 pages comprehending all my stuff, poems and prose.') When last I saw him\u2014four years and a half ago\u2014he was still able, with the aid of a stick or the arm of a friend, to enjoy a ramble through Camden and across the Ferry to Philadelphia, a fine-looking old man, through crippled somewhat in his gait by paralysis, well over six feet in height, with long white hair and beard, something elemental, haughty\u2014the 'I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable' look about him, more developed even perhaps in age than when those words were written; withal an infinite tenderness and wistfulness in his eye\u2014surely never in any man those two opposites, love and pride, exhibited side by side in such splendid antagonism as in him. Now he writes, 'Have not been out-doors for over six months\u2014hardly out of my room, but get along better than you might think for'; his body disabled, and even at times his brain, but his great big heart seemingly the same as ever.</p><p>But to come to November Boughs. The book consists of 140 pp., clear but compact print, prose, and poetry; and to readers of Leaves of Grass and Specimen Days, forms a distinct, notable, and even important addition to both these volumes. The introductory essay is 'A backwards Glance o'er travel'd Roads,' and is really a history of the genesis and purpose of Leaves of Grass; the next twenty pages are occupied by poetical pieces, mostly short, under the general heading of Sands at Seventy; and the remainder of the book consists of short papers on a variety of subjects; a good many literary\u2014Shakespeare, Burns, Tennyson, the Bible, etc.; notes on Father Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, Elias Hicks, George Fox; some more diary scraps; and a few remaining Memoranda of the War and the Hospitals. All these doubtless to be grouped with the earlier work under their different main headings in the complete volume which is to come.</p><p>Of Sands at Seventy, if, as the hour-glass runs out, the movement is a little slower and more laboured, still there is work here to be compared with the author's best: the same flat acceptance of ordinary facts, the same direct gaze into the spiritual world behind them; the same egotism; the same yearning, obstinately-clinging human love; the same unclipped jagged old lines; the same (though perhaps fewer) passages of large emotional volume. If there is a variation it is in the nearness of Death, and the many pieces and poems that embody the experiences of old age and the thoughts of the human creature in pretense of the unknown-to-come; and precious are these, for by how few have such subjects been treated with equal candour or with equal penetration!</p><p>'Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,<br>No birth, identity, form\u2014no object of the world.<br>Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing;<br>Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain.<br>Ample are time and space-ample the fields of Nature.<br>The body, sluggish, aged, cold-the embers left from earlier fires,<br>The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again;<br>The sun now low in the west rises for mornings and for noons <br>continual;<br>To frozen clods ever the spring's invisible law returns,<br>With grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn.'</p><p>Or in 'A Carol closing Sixty-nine':\u2014</p><p>'Of me myself\u2014the jocund heart yet beating in my breast,<br>The body wreck'd, old, poor, and paralysed\u2014the strange inertia<br>falling pall-like round me,<br>The burning fires down in my sluggish blood not yet extinct,<br>The undiminished faith\u2014the group of loving friends.'</p><p>Yet the burden of it all is the same as of old in Leaves of Grass\u2014'Pleasantly and well-suited I walk; wither I walk I cannot define, but I know that it is well.'</p><p>The Sands at Seventy are as variegated as ever. The poet resists anything better than his own diversity. Here is 'The first Dandelion' looking 'forth from its sunny nook of sheltered grass-innocent, golden, calm as the dawn'; here is a song to his Canary-bird; here is the 'small thin Indian helmsman, with brow elate and governing hand,' guiding the steamship through the dangerous rapids of the St. Lawrence; here is a picture of Broadway teeming with human life; here is the 'old salt,' Kossabone, related to the poet 'on his mother's side,' sits on a point overlooking the sea, watching, as his custom is, afternoons, the coming and going of the far vessels: he nearly ninety years old and a sailor all his life, now lives with his grandchild, Jenny:\u2014</p><p>'And now the close of all:<br>One struggling outbound brig, one day, baffled for long\u2014cross- <br>tides and much wrong going,<br>At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright, her whole luck <br>veering,<br>And swiftly bending round the cape, the darkness proudly enter- <br>ing, cleaving, as he watches,<br>'She's free\u2014she's on her destination'\u2014these the last words- <br>when Jenny came, he sat there dead,<br>Dutch Kossabone, Old Salt, related on my mother's side, far back.'</p><p>Here is 'The Voice of the Rain,' very beautiful; and here, at last, most characteristic, most obstinately\u2014clinging of all, is the Good-bye to his readers, entitled 'After the Supper and Talk':\u2014</p><p>'After the supper and talk\u2014after the day is done,<br>As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging,<br>Good-bye and Good-bye with emotional lips repeating,<br>(So hard for his hand to release those hands\u2014no more will they <br>meet,<br>No more for communion of sorrow and joy, of old and young,<br>A far-stretching journey awaits him, to return no more,)<br>Shunning, postponing severance\u2014seeking to ward off the last <br>word ever so little,<br>E'en at the exit-door turning\u2014charges superfluous calling back\u2014 <br>e'en as he descends the steps,<br>Something to eke out a minute additional\u2014shadows of nightfall <br>deepening,<br>Farewells, messages lessening\u2014dimmer the forthgoer's visage <br>and form,<br>Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness\u2014loth, O so loth to depart!<br>Garrulous to the very last.'</p><p>One of the most interesting of the shorter papers is that 'On the Bible as Poetry.' Needless to say that Whitman\u2014modern man though he essentially is\u2014looks upon the Bible as a well-spring of poetry\u2014'the axis of civilisation and history during thousands of years . . . . even to our Nineteenth Century here are the fountain-heads of song.' From him the chunk-headed 'secularist' gets scant regard; 'but reading folks probably get their information of those Bible areas and peoples, as depicted in print by English and French cads, the most shallow, impudent, supercilious brood on earth.'</p><p>Amid the Shakespeare speculations of the day, it is important to note that our author\u2014who has undoubtedly a fine critical sense\u2014leans slightly, though without by any means committing himself, to the Baconian theory; and more important, to find that he is convinced that the great series of historical plays hides within itself a deliberate plan and purpose\u2014that, namely, of exposing the dragon-rancours of diseased and dying Feudalism\u2014much, we suppose, as Ibsen's social dramas to-day are exposing the futilities of diseased and dying Commercialism.</p><p>An affectionate criticism of Robert Burns should commend the volume to the hearts of Scotchmen, though Whitman does not think those true friends of the Ayrshire bard who will not accept for him 'anything less than the highest rank, alongside of Homer, Shakespeare, etc.' A paper on 'Slang' is full of suggestion on that ever-wonderful topic, the growth of language. Another on 'The Old Bowery Theatre,' and Booth, the actor, is replete with local interest and reminiscences. But we must stop. The book is to be had for a dollar and a quarter (about 5s.) from David McKay, publisher, Philadelphia, and probably can be ordered through any British bookseller.</p><p>After all, November Boughs is just what its title suggests. The full foliage and wealth of summer has gone; but in exchange comes the widening prospect, the faint blue distance, the strangely-quickening odour of dead and dying leaves; the branches are alive with motion\u2014the sough of the vast wind that sweeps over the world\u2014the cosmic life\u2014which, however impalpable, breathes through these pages. In one of his pieces in this volume Walt Whitman, apostrophising the Sea, declares that he would gladly surrender the powers of Homer and Shakespeare, if only the Sea would breathe upon his verse 'and leave its odor there.' And in another passage (in the introductory essay) he says\u2014'No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt at such performance, or as aiming mainly towards art or \u00e6stheticism.' It is in this quality of Nature in Whitman's work, transcending Art, yet indeed only possible through the patient study, through the perfection and final surrender of Art, that the secret of Whitman's power lies. The breath of the free wind blows through his pages. Criticism of his imperfections is easy; the secret of his power is difficult to attain.</p><p>EDWARD CARPENTER.</p>", "date": "April 1889", "year": 1889, "creator": "Edward Carpenter", "publication": "The Scottish Art Review", "citation": "Carpenter, Edward. \"'November Boughs'.\" April 1889.

In this the author reviews himself and his work, and notwithstanding all that has been said against his poetical beliefs and methods, reiterates his persuasion of their truth and appeals from the present to the future. Here also he repeats his demand that America should possess a literature peculiarly and exclusively its own, saying, 'No law or people or circumstances ever existed so needing a race of singers and poems differing from all others, and rigidly their own as the land and people and circumstances of our United States.' At the same time he restates his belief that science instead of superseding poetry will only open out fresh and more extensive fields to which the poetic imagination must emigrate. 'Whatever,' he remarks, 'may have been the case in years gone by, the true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only.'

(Walter Scott.)</em></p><p>A COMPLETE edition of Whitman's prose writings in the useful and convenient 'Camelot' series would be very acceptable; and, as one more volume would secure this, I hope the publisher will see his way to it. There is a suggestion of incompleteness about this otherwise excellent series. The number of volumes of selections included in it seems rather excessive. It provides the British public with admirable samples of many authors, but even the British public cannot live well on samples alone. Complete sets of Landor, Swift, Leigh Hunt, and the rest, would, of course, be out of the question in such a series; but it might sometimes be better to give one complete work of an author than cuttings from half a dozen. At any rate, in the case of Whitman, the whole of his prose works are within reach; and, as the two volumes already issued omit several important pieces, there is a special reason why a third and concluding volume should follow. Perhaps the very best piece of prose from Whitman's pen is the preface to the first edition (1855) of Leaves of Grass. Much of the substance of it appeared in another form in the second and subsequent editions, chiefly in the pieces which now bear the titles 'Song of the Answerer' and 'By Blue Ontario's Shore.' It was, however, never reproduced in its original shape until 1868, when Mr. W. M. Rossetti gave an incomplete version of it in his English volume of Selections. In 1881, at the suggestion of the late Thomas Dixon, of Sunderland (to whom Ruskin's letters\u2014entitled Time and Tide\u2014'to a working man of Sunderland' were addressed), and, by permission of the author, I myself reprinted this preface unmutilated; and Whitman includes it in his Specimen Days and Collect. But, for some reason or another, it does not appear in either of the 'Camelot' volumes. Other valuable prefaces and essays are also missing, quite enough in quantity, and quite good enough, to make a volume. Perhaps author, editor, and publisher, will consider the suggestion.</p><p>Leaving now the omissions, we find there is plenty of excellent matter in the present volume. Next to the 'Preface' above named, 'Democratic Vistas' is quite the best thing Whitman has produced in prose. Whatever may be said for the genius that created the peculiar style of Leaves of Grass (and, for my part, I think a great deal may be said on this point) Whitman's essays do not mark him out as a master of style in prose. They are fittingly described by a favourite word of his own\u2014jottings. But what they may lack in style is more than compensated by the abundance of thought they contain. Jottings so valuable will easily pass muster, even though they be not arranged in accordance with high literary art. 'Democratic Vistas' consists of jottings on the future of democracy and, incidentally, on many topics not suggested in the title. The 'other papers' in the volume consist of jottings, variously named, on Shakspere, on Tennyson, on Burns, and on other subjects, including the author himself and his writings. Yet it would be wrong not to correct my criticism about Whitman's style by pointing out that there are numerous passages scattered through all these essays which are remarkable not only for the ideas they express, but for the finished beauty of their form as well.</p><p>The poet of the modern has some interesting things to say about those poets of other days whose reign is now drawing to a close; the singers of 'those beautiful, matchless songs adjusted to other lands than these\u2014other days, another spirit and stage of evolution.' 'What,' he asks, and proceeds to answer,</p><p>'is Tennyson's service to his race, times, and especially to America? First, I should say, his personal character. He is not to be mentioned as a rugged, evolutionary, aboriginal force\u2014but (and a great lesson is in it)he has been consistent throughout with the native, personal, healthy, patriotic, spinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and conventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflects the upper crust of his time, its pale cast of thought\u2014even its ennui\u2026He shows how one can be a royal laureate, quite elegant and 'aristocratic,' and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural' (p. 127).</p><p>Admitting that he may be himself 'non-literary and non-decorous,' Whitman is able and willing to appreciate in Tennyson that 'latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions and in the voice ringing them, which he has caught and brought out beyond all others.' Burns, in some respects, comes closer to Whitman's heart. 'There are many things in Burns's poems and character that specially endear him to America,' he says. For one thing, he was 'essentially a republican'; for another, he was 'an average sample of the good-natured, warm-blooded, proud-spirited, amative, alimentive, convivial, young and early middle-aged man of the decent-born middle classes everywhere and anyhow' whatever all this may mean. In better style Whitman remarks, later on:</p><p>'There is something about Burns peculiarly acceptable to the concrete human point of view. He poetises work- a-day agricultural labour and life (whose spirit and sympathies, as well as practicalities, are much the same everywhere), and treats fresh, often coarse, natural occurrences, loves, persons, not like many new and some old poets, in a genteel style of gilt and china, or at second or third removes, but in their own born atmosphere\u2014laughter, sweat, unction' (p. 118).</p><p>Yet, while anxious to give full honour to all poets of the past, Whitman does not forget for a moment that poetry of the future whose pioneer it is his mission to be. 'Even Shakspere,' he says, 'belongs essentially to the buried past.'</p><p>As to this mission of his, and the way in which he has fulfilled it, Whitman has several things to say\u2014more, perhaps, than was necessary. For in these latter days, without explanation\u2014which he never condescended to give while he was abused\u2014he and his work have come to be pretty well understood. One of the best possible evidences of the inherent strength of Leaves of Grass and its author is that, under circumstances the most unfavourable, and against all kinds of impediments, they have held their own, and come to be esteemed. But Whitman, who would explain nothing in answer to abuse, is prepared to explain much in answer to sympathy; and, accordingly, in three separate articles in this volume, he discourses of himself and his book. Leaves of Grass, he says,</p><p>'is, or seeks to be, simply a faithful and doubtless self-willed record. In the midst of all it gives one man's\u2014the author's\u2014identity, ardours, observations, faiths, and thoughts, coloured hardly at all with any colouring from other faiths, other authors, other identities or times. Plenty of songs had been sung\u2014beautiful, matchless songs\u2014adjusted to other lands than these, other days, another spirit and stage of evolution; but I would sing, and leave out or put in, solely with reference to America and myself and to-day. Modern science and democracy seemed to be throwing out their challenge to poetry to put them in its statements in contradistinction to the songs and myths of the past. As I see it now (perhaps too late), I have unwittingly taken up that challenge, and made an attempt at such statements, which I certainly would not assume to do now, knowing more clearly what it means' (p. 87).</p><p>The book is valuable precisely because it is a faithful and self-willed record. It is, as I have said elsewhere, a biography, in poetry, of the human soul\u2014of Whitman's own soul, ostensibly; really of all souls, for the experience of the individual is simply the experience of the race in miniature. That the record is 'self-willed' is undeniable; and, in these days, when few persons dare to utter their own thought, while most are mere echoes or, at best, speak only when they are quite sure that their opinions are supported by precedent, surely the faithful, honest, uncompromising Whitman is a much-needed teacher.</p><p>WALTER LEWIN.</p>", "date": "June 30 1888", "year": 1888, "creator": "Walter Lewin", "publication": "The Academy", "citation": "Lewin, Walter. \"[Review of Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers].\" 30 June 1888.

According to the practice of his later years the volume is written partly in prose and partly in Walt Whitman's peculiar idea of poetry. There is a melancholy flavor about the whole of it, though the old man tries very hard to be cheerful. More than once, however, he refers to the world's refusal to recognize him as a poet. All the great magazines, he declares, have declined to print his lucubrations, and apparently the general public have not fatigued his publisher with orders for his books. The so-called poetry in this volume is naturally of a valedictory character to a considerable extent, and though it is not less prosaic and unmelodious than the writer's earlier productions, the circumstances under which it was written impart a certain suggestion of pathos to it. Walt Whitman does not indeed face the Unknown with apprehensions and misgivings. If he does not appear to cherish Christian hopes and expectations, his Pantheism has not prevented him from maintaining a belief in another existence, and an existence not less adapted to and filled with activity and energy than the present one. Yet he does not speculate much upon the future. Rather does he seem to be chiefly interested in forecasting the ultimate destiny of 'Leaves of Grass,' which he does not like to think will be relegated to the limbo of unused or unreadable books.</p><p>This question is of course not one upon which those who like or who dislike Walt Whitman's writings can pass final judgment. Posterity often does surprising things and adopts queer views. Among its peculiarities is a tendency 'parcere subjectis et debellare superbos' to spare the conquered and vanquish the proud; and for all any one living knows this proclivity may be exercised on behalf of Walt Whitman. As regards his contemporaries, they certainly have not discovered in him the music of the future, and the reasons which have determined the prevailing judgment upon him do not appear weak or capricious. Walt Whitman himself retains a consolatory assurance of his own position, and it is not worth while to attempt to disturb his faith. In the concluding pages of the present volume he gives some autobiographic memoranda which will be found interesting and quaintly illustrative of character. As for the more pretentious papers\u2014attempts at essay-writing and the like\u2014perhaps the less said about them the better. For it is unfortunately the fact that when Walt Whitman tries to be profound he commonly becomes unintelligible, seeming to lose his footing in a bag of verbiage. His passion for stringing words together in catalogue-form recalls old Burton at times, though of course Whitman has nothing of Burton's erudition. Let us hope, however, that his last booklet may contribute somewhat to the comfort of his age and the assuagement of his infirmities.</p>", "date": "August 16 1891", "year": 1891, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Tribune", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Whitman's Farewell.\" 16 August 1891.

There are, however, three or four which may be mentioned among the most interesting of the new publications of the month.</p><p>The first is the thinly veiled story of the grievances of Queen Nathalie, which is published by Ollendorf, of Paris, under the title 'Le Roi Stanko et la Reine Xenia.' The wrongs of the unhappy Queen Nathalie are set forth in this volume with sympathizing pen. The identity of the various personages described in this chronique scandaleuse are easily recognizable. Queen Nathalie herself has retired into private life, while her own son has paid his first official visit to St. Petersburg. The contrast between the demonstrations of welcome which have been accorded the child, and the cold indifference with which his royal mother has been received in the country which gave her birth, is one of the unpleasant incidents in the development of the Eastern drama.</p><p>A very different book is the latest collection of the poems of Walt Whitman, entitled 'Good-bye, My Fancy,' a second annex to 'The Leaves of Grass,' published by David McKay, of Philadelphia. The book is published as a memorial of war times. The volume contains some of the articles which Walt Whitman has contributed to periodical literature of late years. We extract only one short poem with its characteristic foot-note:</p><p><strong>FOR QUEEN VICTORIA'S BIRTHDAY</strong></p><p>An American arbutus bunch to be put in a little vase on the royal breakfast-table, May 24, 1890:\u2014</p><br><p>Lady, accept a birthday thought\u2014haply an idle gift and <br>token<br>Right from the scented soil's May-utterance here<br>(Smelling of countless blessings, prayers, and old-time <br>thanks)\u2014<br>A bunch of white and pink arbutus, silent, spicy, shy,<br>From Hudson's, Delaware's, or Potomac's woody banks.</p><p><em>Note.</em>\u2014'Very little as we Americans stand this day, with our sixty-five or seventy millions of population, an immense surplus in the treasury, and all that actual power or reserve power (land and sea) so dear to nations, very little, I say do we realize that curious, crawling national shudder when the 'Trent Affair' promised to bring upon us a war with Great Britain, followed unquestionably, as that war would have been, the recognition of the Southern Confederacy by all the leading European nations. It is now certain that all this train of inevitable calamity hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in the prepared and written missives of the British Minister to America, which the Queen (and Prince Albert latent) positively and promptly cancelled; and that her firm attitude did alone erase and leave out against all the other official prestige and Court of St. James. On such minor and personal incidents (so to call them) often depend the great growths and turns of civilization. This moment of a woman and queen surely swung the grandest oscillation of modern history's pendulum. Many sayings and doings of that period, from foreign potentates and powers, might well be dropped in oblivion by America\u2014but never that if I could have my way.'</p><p>Of the English books, that which bears most closely upon current affairs is Harold Frederic's volume on the German Emperor. Mr. Harold Frederic is a thoroughly competent journalist. As the London correspondent of the New York Times he has distinguished himself as almost the only competent letter-writer from the Old World to the New. What Mr. G. W. Smalley was in his prime, some years ago, and more than, that Mr. Harold Frederic is now. He sometimes has a curious squint which prevents his seeing straight; but for good, all-round work, great industry, and capacity for saying what he has to say in clear, interesting English, Mr. Harold Frederic is the best of English correspondents. His book on 'The Young Emperor' is thoroughly characteristic. It is clear, bright, well up to date and thoroughly 'on the nail.' But it bears also some of his characteristic blemishes. Mr. Frederic repeats as true the story that the Emperor Frederick had drawn up and signed his abdication, a statement which is stoutly denied by all those who ought to know, and there are other statements relating to the period of the Emperor Frederick's illness which have given considerable pain to those most concerned.</p><p>Still, after all deductions are made, it is a good and readable book, which appears just in the nick of time, and contains material enabling us to form a conception of the character of one of the most remarkable of modern rulers. It is to be regretted, however, that Mr. Frederic did not complete his book, firstly, by some careful chronological table of the acts and deeds of the young Emperor; secondly, that he did not give us an index; thirdly, that he did not reprint a verbatim translation of the Emperor's speech on education.

It is all a part of him. His life is in it all: 'tis what he is, thinking, seeing, hearing, feeling\u2014more outwardly than inwardly, perhaps. He has no characters; is never dramatic. He is always on the march\u2014</p><p>'I tramp a perpetual journey;'\u2014</p><p>going somewhere\u2014seeing somewhat, hailing, greeting, saluting\u2014reverencing, too, in the good sense of the term. One may not care for this or that so-called poem\u2014think it no poem, for that matter; but take his book, with its accumulating 'annexes,' for all in all, and you cannot well get away from it, are glad to have it around, lying near handy; and are more apt than otherwise to light on a line, or many lines, that go to the spot, as he himself might say, and yield full satisfaction. In reading Emerson's verse to others, I have at times found a disturbance from the thought and beauty of it all (with a secret wish that I had not begun to read and a vow that I would never do the like again), by my auditor's smile or half sneer at the author's sometimes forced rhymes or prosy lines; as though that were the point, and mattered at all. To hear a poem only with the outer ear is not to hear it at all\u2014nine times in ten. And the tenth time, more than likely, there is no poem to hear. Reading Whitman aloud is even more difficult. Not for the faulty rhyme\u2014for the absence of any intention of that sort eliminates that difficulty\u2014but for the same inability of average mortals to detect beneath the strange in form, or the supposed want of proper poetic form, the breathing of a poet-spirit. Lowell voices in the best way it can be voiced this limitation, or to my mind wrong poetic notion, in his 'Fable for Critics:'</p><p>'Then comes Emerson first, whose rich words, every one,<br>Are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on;<br>Whose prose is grand verse, while his verse, the Lord knows,<br>Is some of it pr\u2014\u2014No, 'tis not even prose.'</p><p>The critic could hear the poem underneath Emerson's prose, because</p><p>'Aye climb for his rhyme,'</p><p>closes the finer ear to the revelation.</p><p>'In the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter.<br>But thrown in a heap with a crash and a clatter.'</p><p>And beyond, amid, or underneath the 'crash' and the 'clatter' there is no vibratory soul-music. And yet\u2014</p><p>'Now, it is not one thing nor another alone<br>Makes a poem, but rather the general tone,<br>The something pervading, uniting the whole,<br>The before unconceived, unconceivable soul.'</p><p>When the critic in the next line intimates that this 'something pervading, uniting the whole' may be lost 'just in moving this trifle or that,' and so you</p><p>'Take away, as it were, a chief limb of the statue.'</p><p>he is intent on the perfection of the artificer or builder, so seeking the poem's life, loses it. Lost to him because of faulty form; but for another, willing the 'unconceivable soul' should build its own form, not dictatory, not outwardly measuring, there may abide all the force and beauty of a spiritual or poetical vision; the glimpsing of that which, after all, for the most part, lies beyond the ken of sight, or power of words or painter's brush to report,\u2014'the unconceived, unconceivable soul.' Poetry is ever suggestion; never 'a twice-told tale of God.' There is Lowell's 'Foot-Path.'</p><p>'It mounts athwart the windy hill<br>Through shallow slopes of upland bare,<br>And fancy climbs with footfall still<br>Its narrowing curves that end in air.'</p><p>What lies beyond?</p><p>'What Nature for her poets hides,<br>'Tis wiser to divine than clutch.'</p><p>The 'prying, peeping critic' here takes to his heels; the poet comes joyously forward, and modestly:</p><p>'The bird I list hath never come<br>Within the scope of mortal ear;<br>My prying step would make him dumb,<br>And the fair tree, his shelter, sear.</p><p>'Behind the hill, behind the sky,<br>Behind my inmost thought, he sings;<br>No feet avail; to hear it nigh,<br>The song itself must lend the wings.'</p><p>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217</p><p>I know not, and will never pry,<br>But trust our human heart for all;<br>Wonders that from the seeker fly<br>Into an open sense may fall.</p><p>The culture, the skill, the art, that close this 'open sense,' turns the poet blind from his vision.</p><p>Art lies in knowing how little is needed. A new vista, and the work is done. This is the 'open secret' in all true civilizing\u2014to get rid of the superfluous and be not only content but well supplied with little. Neither too much, nor too much finish. Whitman speaks of 'the last polish and intellectual 'cuteness of Emerson,' but just whether to like it or not, I don't make out. To my reading the 'polish' and the ''cuteness' both go to rendering best things in smallest compass. In this respect Whitman does not himself, certainly, err. He owns up for himself: 'I have probably not been enough afraid of careless touches from the first\u2014and am not now\u2014nor of parrot-like repetitions, nor platitudes and commonplace.' And yet, perhaps again, he would have spent it all or very much of it had he faltered for such 'intellectual ''cuteness' or to give a 'last polish.' One may with profit to himself do considerable editing, abbreviating or omitting altogether phrases and lines. But solely, as I think, it is their redundancy that is disturbing\u2014this however, in his longer poems, wherein one at times loses himself in nothing special or tires of too much 'cataloguing.' Whitman says, 'Perhaps I am too democratic for such avoidances.' (Of this much talk of the 'democratic' there may be something to say another time. Just now to say that it sometimes reminds me of my Sunday-school teacher's encomium of the universal, democratic, paternal idea of 'the good God, who knows and has numbered every hair on your head, even the hairs of your eyebrows, and each drop of blood in your entire system.' But it always seemed to me there was no small 'waste of powder' in such exactitude: as though a few hairs more or less, or drops of blood, much mattered\u2014to the soul of me!)</p><p>To leave preface just at the end and come to the book\u2014most welcome is this 'Second Annex.' No, you had 'not better withhold.' There is no 'old age' nor 'paralysis' here that tires, or makes me sorrow that you have kept and given forth these</p><p>'Last droplets of and after spontaneous rain.'</p><p>'This little cluster' brings fragrant memories and old-age excellencies\u2014'from sane, completed, vital, capable old age.' Well, I agree (and it please me)\u2014'The final proof of song or personality [and I have but stumbled on this now after penning the above] is a sort of matured, accreted, superb, evoluted, almost divine, impalpable diffuseness and atmosphere or invisible magnetism, dissolving and embracing all\u2014and not any special achievement of passion, pride, metrical form, epigram, plot, thought, or what is called beauty.' You have done well to 'improve to-day's opportunity;' but do not 'wind up'\u2014till you do wind up. All these last little chants, songs, greetings, come with especial flavor of friendliness, as do all the bits of reminiscence. Especially have I enjoyed 'Old Actors, Singers, Shows, etc.'\u2014you say in 'New York;' but I had my hearing of most of those you mention elsewhere. The sad thing of it all is the 'sooner or later inevitably wending to the flies or exit-door\u2014vanishing to sight and ear\u2014and never materializing on this earth's stage again!' Why things cannot stay and be and remain on and on, when once they come\u2014that is the question. And the answer is, 'Perhaps, most likely, they do\u2014and will, forever!'</p><p>The two poems that always appear to my mental view when I think of or turn Leaves of Grass are: 'The Song of the Open Road' and 'The Mystic Trumpeter.' That they are so much different from or superior to others in the same volume, I do not presume to say; but they for some reason have fixed themselves in among my likings, and I turn the leaves sometimes with a sort of half fearing they may have some way escaped their rootings, and are no longer there. I am sorry the book is not now before me, that I may refresh myself with lines that it would also be here a pleasure to quote. But here at hand is 'When the Full-Grown Poet Came'\u2014a short poem, but one that holds philosophy for all\u2014poet or non-poet\u2014if such there be\u2014equally concerned with the same reconciliation and harmony. I will read it again for myself and write it out as I read:</p><p>'When the full-grown poet came,<br>Out spake pleased Nature (the round, impassive globe, with all its shows of<br> day and night),<br>Saying, He is mine;<br>But out spake, too, the Soul of man, proud, jealous and unreconciled, Nay,<br> he is mine alone;<br>\u2014Then the full-grown poet stood between the two, and took each by the <br>hand;<br>And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly holding hands,<br>Which he shall never release until he reconciles the two,<br>And wholly and joyously blends them.'</p><p><em>Sidney Morse.</em></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217 'Good-Bye, my Fancy!'

'Good-bye, my Fancy!' is Walt Whitman's Hermes-image to convey his parting salutations to the afterworld. In its sixty-six pages we have a medley and motley of prose and verse like what the countryman calls the rich 'strippings' of the cow's milk, the last and oiliest, the most nutritious and creamiest of the lacteal fountain. A few things here have been published before. The Critic's readers have tasted and enjoyed the uncloying 'Old Man's Rejoinder,' 'For Queen Victoria's Birthday,' 'The Pallid Wreath' and 'Unassail'd Renown'; but the bulk of the book\u2014its stem, stalk and flower\u2014is new to the public and has not before tempted the intellectual palate.</p><p>I sing of life, yet mind me still of Death,</p><p>is the keynote of the volume, in which the author humorously calls himself a sea-shell cast up by the sea. Yet does he not remember the wonderful susurrus of that Wordsworthian shell which, though far inland, whispered of its native place even as that susurrus in the soul whispered of immortality? The almost dead shell of the 'greybeard sufi' has a live soul in it capable still of radiant abalone-like iridescences. The chemist's tincture brings out these wondrous tints even as opportunity will elicit them from the 'conch' of Camden.</p><p>In fact, here I am these current years 1890 and '91 (each successive fortnight getting stiffer and stuck deeper), much like some hard-cased dilapidated grim ancient shell-fish or time-bang'd conch (no legs, utterly non-locomotive) cast up high and dry on the shore-sands, helpless to move anywhere\u2014nothing left but to behave myself quiet, and while away the days yet assign'd, and discover if there is anything for the said grim and time-bang'd conch to be got at last out of inherited good spirits and primal buoyant centre-pulses down there deep somewhere within his gray-blurr'd old shell***And old as I am I feel to-day almost a part of some frolicsome wave.</p><p>The 'shell' is indeed a part of the 'frolicsome wave' which laves it into exquisite curves and colors. This is Whitman's universal quality, his sympathy, his world-wide hand-clasp, his general salutation to the universe. The shell and the sea are comrades, and so is every creeping and smiling or sailing and winged creature\u2014comrades all in that catholic-apostolic camaraderie which includes every sprout and germ of the divine energy\u2014a camaraderie as close and as kind as that which clasped hamadryad and enclosing oak together. Death, which inspires so many of these beautiful irregular lines, looms up magical and benign before a mind simply wondering, not abashed\u2014the 'eid\u03cclon-yacht' of his soul ready to put forth on its mirage-haunted seas with utmost trustfulness. Whitman's beliefs come out singularly strong and triumphant here and there among the creed-leaves of the book: beliefs in future personality, identity, immortality, a merciful and loving God, progress, consciousness: he peoples that dim world with these, and it becomes immediately lustrous. These brave beliefs ring almost gayly through 'An Ended Day,' 'The Pallid Wreath,' 'My 71st Year,' 'Shakespeare-Bacon's Cipher,' and other protests against materialism, often as beautifully expressed as Tennyson's or Whittier's vital faith. Indeed, the whole book is a book of 'last words' from dying lips sealing a life that has been blameless. There is no sound of lamentation or Job-cry in it, pervaded as it is with bright, broad optimism, the grace of benignant utterance, the egoism of a healthy and gracious child. Almost the only querulous note is the plaintive reference to rejected MSS. sent in to the 'great magazines.' The generous recognition of Tennyson and Ruskin and the other English and American admirers has offset this, and kept the paralyzed author from real want. The last twenty pages or so are full of Pascal-like pens\u00e9es  grouped in paragraphs, vividly poetic, many of them, with Whitmanesque threads and colorations running all through. Such are 'A Death-Banquet,' 'Some Laggards Yet,' 'Splinters,' 'Health,' 'Crossing from Jersey City,' 'An Engineer's Obituary' (his brother), and the 'Old-Age Jottings.' Histrionic New York of thirty or forty years ago reappears delightfully in 'Old Actors, Singers, Shows, etc.'\u2014a tell-tale bead of personal recollections in which the author suspends a votive offering before each vanished image and lingering voice, all quaintly carved in his own rich involved English. Much ruddy philosophy courses through these recollections\u2014healthy love of the drama, love of a beautiful voice, love of Shakespeare and the great artists\u2014of Alboni and Jenny Lind and Fanny Kemble and fine reading.</p><p>The author turns the kodak on himself and reveals each inner sanctuary of his moral and physical nature. Now in his seventy-third year, he is as fresh and piquant as ever, as devoted to his great 'America,' his ideal Democracy, his poetic theories as he was in 1855, when he began jotting down his revolutionary memoranda. And at the forefront of it all looks out a portrait\u2014profile rounded like the arch of the full moon, nebulous, Ossianlike, but striking in its filmy vagueness.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217 Good-Bye, my Fancy!

The fragmentary, disjointed essay entitled 'An Old Man's Rejoinder,' is suggestive of unmitigated pathos. There is just enough in it to show how deeply Walt Whitman has suffered because he has not been able to convince competent critics of his ability as a poet, and there is enough there as well to make one sympathize with the old poet, no matter how much one may feel the justice of what the critics have done. There is nothing of any value whatever in this book. One reads parts of it with a twinge of curiosity tempered with sadness. So far as what purports to be literature is concerned here is the end of a wasted life. 'I have been and am rejected by all the great magazines,' he says, and the saying suggests untold pangs of defeat. That the great magazines were right and Walt Whitmon sic wrong the contents of this thin, crazy-quilt volume amply prove without the trouble of calling upon 'Leaves of Grass' for more convincing testimony.

In these Mr. Whitman's manner remains much the same as in his chants, while the reader is at least spared the continual negation of the laws of the technical art of poetry. In an essay on 'National Literature' he finds the essential traits of the American people to be good-nature, decorum, and intelligence, and bases his hopes upon these qualities. In music, despite the critics who assure him he belongs to the worship of Wagner, he dwelt under 'the old Italian dispensation,' as he calls it, and wishes that he might thank the composer Verdi for 'much noble pleasure and happiness.' The somber velvet of the voice of Signora Alboni1 also charmed him; and the brave songs of the Hutchinsons, with their sister, 'the red-cheeked New England carnation, sweet Abby.'2 Kean in King John, and Fanny Kemble in Fazio, 'a rapid-running, yet heavy-timber'd, tremendous, wrenching, passionate play,' and the comedy of Hackett,3 appealed, in their day, to Mr. Whitman; and were followed in his theatrical enjoyments by a long list of other artists. He describes his habitation, 'a rather large 20 by 20 low-ceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin,' in literary disorder of papers and books, with its three windows, the stove and oak-wood fuel, and the great arm-chair spread with a 'wide wolf-skin of hairy black and silver.'</p><p>If this volume shall be, as the author appears to intend, his last literary effort, it closes firmly and fitly the literary career of a poet who has with pride and fidelity obeyed his own genius, and who has sought to collect within himself, and to understand and speak\u2014in his oracular, strange voice\u2014the experiences of common humanity.</p><p>\u2217 Good-Bye My Fancy By Walt Whitman D.

But they are valuable beyond measure to confirm and endorse the varied train, facts, theories, and faith of the whole preceding life.' So says Walt Whitman in a foot-note to the little volume which he has just put forth ('Good-bye, my Fancy.' 2d. Annex to 'Leaves of Grass.' Philadelphia: David McKay). We may hope that the aged poet will still be with us for many a long day, but this collection of scraps of all kinds\u2014verses, essays, thoughts, speeches, recollections\u2014have something of the interest of last words.

The philosophy of Greece taught normality and the beauty of life. Christianity teaches how to endure illness and death. I have wonder'd whether a third philosophy fusing both, and doing full justice to both, might not be outlined. . . . It will not be enough to say that no Nation ever achiev'd materialistic, political, and money-making successes, with general physical comfort, as fully as the United States of America are to-day achieving them. I know very well that those are the indispensable foundations\u2014the sine qua non of moral and heroic (poetic) fruitions to come. For if those pre-successes were all\u2014if they ended at that\u2014if nothing more were yielded than so far appears\u2014a gross materialistic prosperity only\u2014America, tried by subtlest tests, were a failure\u2014has not advanced humanity a bit further than other nations. . . . Essentially my own printed records, all my volumes, are doubtless but offhand utterances from Personality, spontaneous, following implicitly the inscrutable command, dominated by that Personality, vaguely even if decidedly, and with little or nothing of plan, art, erudition, &c. If I have chosen to hold the reins, the mastery, it has mainly been to give the way, the power, the road, to the invisible steeds. (I wanted to see how a Person of America, the last half of the nineteenth century, would appear, put quite freely and fairly in honest type.)</p><p>Turning now to personalia, we may give a few of Walt Whitman's 'old age jottings.' He describes how he was seriously ill and paralyzed after the war, and had his books printed during a lingering convalescence 'to occupy the tediousness of glum days and nights.' The sale of the volumes abroad was very satisfactory. 'The price was 10 dol. a set. Both the cash and the emotional cheer were deep medicines; many paid double or treble price. (Tennyson and Ruskin did).' Among other subscribers, he mentions the two Rossettis, W. B. Scott, E. W. Gosse, Spence Watson, G. H. Lewes, G. H. Boughton, M. D. Conway, and Hubert Herkomer. This opportune English encouragement plucked him, he says, like a brand from the burning: 'and if ever I have a biographer I charge him to put it in the narrative. I have had the noblest friends and backers in America; and yet perhaps the tenderest and gratefullest breath of my heart has gone, and ever goes, over the sea-gales across the big pond.'</p><p>Of his life in general he gives the following summary:\u2014</p><p>I have pass'd an active life, as country school-teacher, gardener, printer, carpenter, author, and journalist, domiciled in nearly all the United States and principal cities, North and South\u2014went to the front (moving about and occupied as army nurse and missionary) during the Secession War, 1861 to '65, and in the Virginia hospitals and after the battles of that time, tending the Northern and Southern wounded alike\u2014work'd down South and in Washington city arduously three years\u2014contracted the paralysis which I have suffer'd ever since\u2014and now live in a little cottage of my own, near the Delaware in New Jersey. My chief book, unrhym'd and unmetrical (it has taken thirty years, peace and war, 'a borning'), has its aim, as once said, 'to utter the same old human critier\u2014but now in Democratic American modern and scientific conditions.' Then I have publish'd two prose works 'Specimen Days,' and a late one 'November Boughs.'</p><p>Of 'the little cottage' he gives the following picture:\u2014</p><p>In the upper of a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river, earth shore, sixty miles up from the sea, is a rather large 20-by-20 low ceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin. The floor, three quarters of it with an ingrain carpet, is half cover'd by a deep litter of books, papers, magazines, thrown-down letters and circulars, rejected manuscripts, memoranda, bits of light or strong twine, a bundle to be 'express'd,' and two or three venerable scrap books. In the room stand two large tables (one of ancient St. Domingo mahogany with immense leaves) cover'd by a jumble of more papers, a varied and copious array of writing materials, several glass and china vessels or jars, some with cologne water, other with real honey, granulated sugar, a large bunch of beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums, some letters and envelopt papers ready for the post office, many photographs, and a hundred indescribable things besides. There are all around many books, some quite handsome editions, some half cover'd by dust, some within reach, evidently used (good-sized print, no type less than long primer), some maps, the Bible (the strong, cheap edition of the English crown), Homer, Shakespere, Walter Scott, Emerson, Ticknor's 'Spanish Literature,' John Carlyle's Dante, Felton's Greece, George Sand's Consuelo, a very choice little Epictetus, some novels, the latest foreign and American monthlies, quarterlies, and so on. There being quite a strew of printer's proofs, and slips, and the daily papers, the place with its quaint old-fashioned calmness has also a smack of something alert and of current work. There are several trunks and depositories back'd up at the walls; (one well-bound and big box came by express lately from Washington city, after storage there for nearly twenty years). Indeed the whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past life. I have here various editions of my own writings, and sell them upon request; one is a big volume of complete poems and prose, 1000 pages, autograph, essays, speeches, portraits from life, &c. Another is a little Leaves of Grass, latest date, six portraits, morocco bound, in pocket-book form.</p><p>Fortunately the apartment is quite roomy. There are three windows in front. At one side is the stove, with a cheerful fire of oak wood, near by a good supply of fresh sticks, whose faint aroma is plain. On another side is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets. Toward the windows is a huge arm-chair (a Christmas present from Thomas Donaldson's young daughter and son,) Philadelphia timber'd as by some stout ship's spars, yellow polish'd, ample, with rattan-woven seat and back, and over the latter a great wide wolf skin of hairy black and silver, spread to guard against cold and draught. A time-worn look and scent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it.</p><p>May the heart of oak within him long continue to beat!</p>", "date": "December 12 1891", "year": 1891, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "Pall Mall Gazette", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman's Good-Bye.\" 12 December 1891.

RHYS and his publisher surely meant well when they decided to issue a volume of selections from Leaves of Grass.\u2217 The book is not intended for the confirmed admirers of Whitman, for they will be satisfied with nothing less than the complete work, and it can be of small benefit to his opponents. These opponents may be divided into two classes: persons who honestly object to Whitman's plainness of speech, because they regard it as unnecessary and unfitting. They say there is a time to be silent, and though no part or function of man if properly treated is disgraceful, there is no reason why all should be publicly exhibited. Whitman, they say, has erred in judgment. These persons we can respect; their opinion is honest and intelligible. The other class we cannot respect. It consists for the most part of hack writers to the press who think it no portion of their duty to know anything of the works they are paid to review\u2020 and of the patrons of these scribes, the retailers of literary small-talk in British drawing-rooms, whose god is Mrs. Grundy, and whose sole virtue is to appear respectable. No doubt a good many of these will buy the Selections, Whitman's reputation among them having, hitherto, been questionable; just as an actress of easy virtue draws them to the theatre, though her histronic powers are nowhere and her manners on the stage the pink of propriety.</p><p>These persons will certainly be disappointed, not only with the selections which Mr. Rhys has prepared, but with the original and complete volume itself. They will not find in either what they want. The speech is plain and unveiled, but cleanly. Veiled obscenity in the shape of a joke, a spicy story, or the reports of criminal cases in the Pall Mall Gazette are more to their minds. The second-hand bookseller knows their taste well, and when he labels a volume 'curious' adds fifty per cent. to the price. There are even certain fellows of the baser sort whose trade consists in lending out willfully obscene books to these 'respectable' people for their private reading.</p><p>Their private reading, to be sure! for in public nothing\u2014unless it be the Pall Mall's leading articles\u2014could exceed the solemn piety and hatred of everything gross which they exhibit. Nothing that would bring 'the blush to the maiden cheek' can be tolerated by them. They are above all else zealous for the virtue of their womankind, just as if they had never laughed over the story of a treacherous seduction, or participated in one themselves. Not, indeed, that they object to being described as 'knowing dogs' or 'men about town,' for this rather enhances their reputation among some of their fair friends. The British matrons are eager enough to give their daughters in marriage to them, regardless of the prior claim which some other young woman may have, but which she cannot enforce because it has not received a priestly blessing; nor are the maidens themselves touched with remorse or with sympathy when they usurp the place. Mrs. Grundy does not require it so to act as they do is respectable, and there is nothing more to be said or done.</p><p>Yet even respectable people need relaxation sometimes, and to test their private morality you must ascertain why the gentlemen guffau over their wine, and the ladies in the drawing-room\u2014before the gentlemen arrive\u2014titter hysterically behind their handkerchiefs. Mrs. Josephine Butler, many years ago, stated publicly that she had given up dinner-parties because she could not endure the after-dinner talk of the drawing-rooms.</p><p>These are the people who most vigorously condemn as immoral the plain spoken, cleanly minded Whitman, and while, as we have said, they will very likely buy Mr. Rhys' book, there is no hope that it will benefit them. Possibly, however, a copy here and there will fall into the hands of some man or woman who, thus becoming acquainted with the 'good grey poet' for the first time, will make good use of the opportunity. To many Whitman has, hitherto, been only a name; to some not even that. Perhaps the little volume has a mission to them.</p><p>Coming now to the book itself we find something to condemn and something, also, to praise. The portrait is no better than a caricature. The Introductory Notice is interesting, but it would have been more satisfactory had its author kept clear of ungraceful affectation in style. 'Depicture' and 'invigorative' are not elegant, and 'most immediate' is something worse. However, in these cases we are able to gather what the writer means; but occasionally it is impossible. What, for example does he mean by this: 'Born on Long Island or Paumanok, its Indian name, by which he always calls it, in the State of New York, of a stalwart race of farmers, in 1819, the freedom of sun and wind was his, in a wide country side, with rising hills around, and the sea that he has sung so affectionately, with such deep sympathy, so that is harmonies seem to have subtly informed his poetry, close by.' In short, if we may presume to give a word of advice to Mr. Rhys it will be\u2014avoid, as you would poison, the mannerisms\u2014not to say vulgarisms of the so-called \u00e6sthetic school. The best written passages are those which, obviously, are in the author's natural style. Mr. Rhys is a hearty yet discriminating admirer of Whitman. His reference to Burns is very happy, and there is much justice in his remark that the advance Whitman has made 'is a great one, beyond a doubt. The only danger is that in accepting this new tendency we may neglect the great virtues of past modes. Always the salvation of all art expression lies in the perfect adjustment of the new with the old.' Mr. Rhys does not note the real advance with, as it seems to us, Whitman had made beyond his predecessors, namely in his sentiment toward death. Others have treated death as a 'dread monster,' an enemy, or have simply ignored it. Even Goethe said 'Death is something so strange that, notwithstanding all experience, one thinks it impossible for it to seize a beloved object; and it always presents itself as something incredible and unexpected.' Whitman alone hails it lovingly, as a friend:</p><p>'Come, lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later delicate death.</p><p>'Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure enwinding arms of cool, enfolding death.</p><p>'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.'</p><p>'The method of selection adopted in preparing the volume,' remarks Mr. Rhys modestly, 'has certainly not been scientific or very profoundly critical.' The task of selection in the case of Whitman would undoubtedly have peculiar difficulties. 'The limitations of the average run of readers have been, as far as could be surmised, the limitations of the book.' All things considered, Mr. Rhys has chosen well, but that the Song of Myself, containing as it does some of Whitman's finest as well as his most characteristic work, should have been wholly omitted, is singular. It is here he gives his key-note:</p><p>'I celebrate myself and sing myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.'</p><p>Here, also, occur such grand passages as the following:</p><p>'Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument<br> of the earth<br>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own<br>And I know that the Spirit of God is the brother of my own<br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers<br>And that a kelson of the creation is love.'<br>. . . . . . .<br>'Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.'</p><p>'Vivas to those who have fail'd!<br>And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!<br>And to those themselves who sank in the sea!<br>And to all generals that lost engagements and all overcome heroes!<br>And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!'</p><p>Another omission which we can hardly approve is The Singer in Prison, but after all, something had to be omitted, and the editor's task was by no means an easy one. He has not omitted, as some editors might have done, In a City Dead House and The Flight of the Eagles. The former touches on a subject treated by Hood in his Bridge of Sighs, but grandly not morbidly. The latter is as artistic as anything Whitman has written. Mr. Rhys and Mr. Scott deserve credit for this effort to popularize Leaves of Grass.

Written on the spot, in 1863\u201365. Author's Publication Camden, New Jersey, 1875\u201376.</p><p>This is a little book which the Peace Society would do well to circulate at a cheap rate in tens of thousands. During the Union War, a War of Secession as some prefer to call it, Walt Whitman continued steadily through '63, '64, and '65, to visit the sick and wounded of the American armies, both on the field and in the hospitals in and around Washington city. From the first he kept a little note book for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh his memory of names and circumstances, and what was specially wanted, &c. In these he briefed cases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp, by the roadside, and not seldom by the corpses of the dead. Of the present volume (a presentation copy to a fellow-townsman lies before us), most of its pages are verbatim renderings from such pencillings on the spot. Some were scratched down from narratives he heard and itemized while watching, or writing, or leading somebody amid these scenes. 'Future years,' he says, 'will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors (not the few great battles) of the Secession War. In the mushy influences of current times the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten. The interior history of the War will not only never be written,\u2014its practicality, minutiae of deeds and persons, will never be suggested. The actual soldier of 1862\u201365, North and South, with all his ways, his increditable dauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his appetite, rashness, his superb strength and animality, lawless gait, and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp\u2014I say, will never be written\u2014perhaps must not and shall not be.' The present memoranda provides a few stray glimpses into that life, and into those lurid interiors of that period, never to be fully conveyed to the future. It is the hospital part of the drama that is principally here recalled, and of course but a small part of that. The revelation is at once shocking and cheering-shocking, for the man's inhumanity to man, slaves in slavery, tyranny, mutual hate, rebellion, civil war, destructions starting at noonday and at midnight still unsated, horribly obstinate and earnest death struggles, blood, fire, flame, pestilence, wide devastation; cheering, for the glints of manly and womanly virtues under emergencies, or real soldierly heroism in old and young, of patient endurance under hopeless suffering, of customs such as the common routine of life cannot possibly evoke, of disinterested self-sacrifice for the sake of others, of kind offices done under the most unfavourable circumstances. The brief, bare sketches, uncommon and unimproved, as they are, make the book truly one of surpassing human interest,\u2014an interest peculiar to itself, and such as no other book we should read possesses, unless it be the precious record of hospital work or experience of Florence Nightingale at Scutari, but even in that case the details are nothing like so graphic, or given with such significant telling brevity. No poet of any clime\u2014not even Shakespeare, Scott, or Southey\u2014ever depicted the woes of war so powerfully and touchingly as Walt Whitman does, as it were, with a few hurried pencil strokes, in these memoranda. We cannot resist the temptation to quote a few lines. Here is a picture of the camp of the wounded at Chancellorville: 'O heaven, what a scene is this! Is this indeed humanity\u2014these butchers' shambles? There are several of them. There they lie, in the largest, in an open space in the woods, from five to six hundred poor fellows\u2014the groans and screams\u2014the odour of blood, mixed with the fresh scent of the night, the grass, the trees\u2014that slaughter-house!\u2014O well is it their mothers, their sisters cannot see them\u2014cannot conceive, or never conceived, these things . . . . One man is shot by a shell, both in the arm and leg-both are amputated\u2014here lie the rejected members. Some have their legs blown off\u2014some bullets through the breast, some indescribably horrid wounds in the face or head, all mutilated, sickening, torn, gouged out\u2014some in the abdomen\u2014some mere boys\u2014here is one his face enveloped in chalk, lying perfectly still, a bullet has perforated his abdomen\u2014life is ebbing fast, there is no help for him. In the camp of the wounded are many rebels, badly hurt\u2014they take their regular turns with the rest, just the same as any\u2014the surgeons use them just the same . . . . Such is the camp of the wounded\u2014such a fragment, a reflection afar off of the bloody scene\u2014while over all the clear, large moon comes out at times softly, gently shining.' We might fill several columns with what Mr. Whitman calls Glimpses of War's Hell-Scenes, but we prefer closing with a simple scototype regarding two brothers, one South, one North. 'I staid to-night a long time by the bedside of a new patient, a young Baltimorean, aged about 19 years, W.S.P. (2nd Md. Southern), very feeble, right leg amputated, can't sleep hardly at all\u2014has taken a great deal of morphine, which, as usual, is costing more than it comes to. Evidently very intelligent and well-bred\u2014very affectionate\u2014held on to my hand, and put it to his face, unwilling to let me leave. As I was lingering, soothing him in his pain, he says to me suddenly, 'I hardly think you know who I am\u2014I don't wish to impose upon you\u2014I am a rebel soldier.' I said I did not know that, but it made no difference . . . . Visiting him daily for about two weeks after that, while he lived (death had marked him, and he was quite alone) I loved him much, always kissed him, and he did me . . . . In an adjoining ward I found his brother, an officer of rank, a Union soldier, a brave and religious man (Col. Clifton J. Prentiss, Sixth Md. Infantry, ninth corps, wounded in one of his engagements at Petersburg, April 2nd\u2014lingered, suffered much\u2014died in Brooklyn, August 20, 1865). It was in the same battle both were hit. One was a strong Unionist, the other South, both fought on their respective sides, both badly wounded, and both brought together here after an absence of four years. Each died for his cause.'</p>", "date": "July 7 1876", "year": 1876, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Sunderland Weekly Times", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Memoranda During the War].\" 7 July 1876.

Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti London: John Camden Hotten. 1868.</p><p>Some years ago, when a few copies of a volume called Leaves of Grass found their way into this country from America, the general verdict of those who had an opportunity of examining the book was that much of it was indescribably filthy, most of it mere incoherent rhapsody, none of it what could be termed poetry in any sense of the word, and that, unless at the hands of some enterprising Holywell Street publisher, it had no chance of the honour of an English reprint. In part this opinion is already proved to have been a mistaken one, for a Westend publisher has taken compassion on the stranger, and now presents it to the British public in a comely form. It may be as well to state at the outset, that the volume published by Mr. Hotten is not precisely a reprint of the original Leaves of Grass. It contains much new matter written since the appearance of that work, and does not contain any of the pieces marked by that peculiar freedom of speech which is generally associated in men's minds with the name of Walt Whitman. For the sake of all parties, the prurient as well as the prudish, lest the one should be unnecessarily alarmed or the other led into an unremunerative venture, it is only fair to say that there is nothing in the present edition to disqualify it for decent society, not to say qualify it for a place in the Biblioth\u00e8que bleue . It has cost Mr. Rossetti severe pangs so he informs us, to part with so much as, from considerations of prudence, he has been obliged to exclude. 'This peculiarly nervous age,' this 'mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century,' with its present absurd notions about decency, morality, and propriety, could not be expected to receive 'the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings,' in that \u00e6sthetic spirit in which they should be accepted; and, as he was unwilling to mutilate, 'the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems, and some extremely fine ones\u2014notably one of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled, Walt Whitman.' In one respect we are willing to admit the loss sustained in this last instance. The 'poem' here referred to is the one which contains the key to Walt Whitman's philosophy and poetic theory. It is in it that he describes himself and his qualifications for the office of poet of the future, grounding his claim upon the fact of his being 'hankering, gross, mystical, nude, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, no more modest than immodest'; and proposing to produce poetry of corresponding qualities, a promise which we must say he most conscientiously fulfils. Its excellence may be open to question, but about its value to the reader who wishes to understand Walt Whitman there can be no doubt whatever.</p><p>The present edition is to be considered as an experiment. By excluding everything offensive, the editor hopes to induce people to reconsider the case of Walt Whitman, and reverse the verdict which has been already pronounced. This, we need scarcely observe, is rather more than they can be fairly asked to do, while the evidence which supports the gravest of charges brought against him is suppressed. But this is not all that Mr. Rossetti expects. The present selection is so to brace and fortify the British mind that in a short time, he trusts, it will be able to relish what now in its weakness it rejects. A complete edition of Walt Whitman, with all the dirt left in, he looks forward to as 'the right and crowning result' of his labours. This is but the school-boy's pudding, which, if we only finish it off, is to be succeeded by a full meal of the uncommonly strong meat he has in reserve for us. We must confess we should very much prefer to see Mr. Rossetti employing himself on some task more worthy of his abilities. He has on many occasions done good service as a critic to literature and art, but we cannot look upon his present enterprise as one in any way beneficial to either. He desires to have Walt Whitman recognized, not merely as a great poet, but as the founder of a new school of poetic literature which is to be greater and more powerful than any the world has yet seen. He is not, it is true, entirely alone in this attempt. There have been already certain indications of a Walt Whitman movement in one or two other quarters. More than a year ago there was a paper in the Fortnightly Review , which, however, was not so much a criticism of his poetry as of his person, the writer having had, as well as we recollect, the privilege of reviewing him as he bathed-an important advantage, certainly, in the case of a poet whose principal theme is his own body. Then Mr. Robert Buchanan took him up in the Broadway magazine, and, saying nearly all that has ever been said against Walt Whitman\u2014that he is no poet and no artist, that he is gross, monotonous, loud, obscure, prone to coarse animalism and to talking rank nonsense\u2014nevertheless arrived at pretty much the same conclusion as Mr. Rossetti, at least as to the powerful influence he is to exercise over the literature of the future. Something of this sort we might, indeed have expected. There are people whose reading of the Horatian saying about popular opinion is 'nunquam vulgus rectum videt,' and who always set themselves to find virtues in everything that is generally condemned. Besides, it would be idle to deny that Walt Whitman has many attractions for minds of a certain class. He is loud, swaggering, and self-assertive, and so gets credit for strength with those who worship nothing that is not strong. He is utterly lawless, and in consequence passes for being a great original genius. His produce is unlike anything else that has ever appeared in literature, and that is enough for those who are always on the look-out for novelty. He is rich in all those qualities of haziness, incoherence, and obscurity which seem to be the first that some readers nowadays look for in poetry. But, above all, he runs a muck with conventionalities and decencies of every sort, which naturally endears him to those silly people who take a childish delight in seeing the respectabilities of the world pulled by the nose, and what they consider its stupid prejudices shocked. We need scarcely say we do not suspect a man of Mr. Rossetti's taste and judgment of this kind of enthusiasm. If we were to hazard a theory, we should be inclined to attribute his advocacy of Walt Whitman's poetical claims to an impatience of the feebleness, emptiness, and sentimentality so abundant in modern poetry. The feeling is one with which we do not quarrel; we only object to the form in which it finds expression. A plague of tinkling cymbals is not to be met by a counter treatment of sounding brass.</p><p>An admirer of Walt Whitman has one immense advantage. There is no standard by which his idol can be measured, no known test which can be applied to prove his quality. There is, therefore, a wide field for that dogmatic assertion which is the favourite argument of the transcendental critic. You must not object that his poetry has no melody, music, or form. It is something above and beyond all requirements of that kind. You are not to raise the objection that in a great deal of what he writes there is no meaning at all, and in a great deal more the meaning, when got at, is utterly commonplace. Poetry like Walt Whitman's is not to be judged of by any one who is influenced by narrow considerations of meaning. You are not to take exception to his language, that it is a vile jargon of his own coining. A poet of this order naturally rises above the trammels of precedent in the matter of language. As to the absence of imagination, invention, fancy, art, and sundry other things more or less looked for in poetry, to complain of this in the present instance only shows that you are incapable of understanding the subject. This sort of argument always tells powerfully with the timid, with those people who are haunted by a nervous dread of being set down as dull and commonplace if they allow common sense to influence their judgment; and besides, it has the merit of being unanswerable, except by contradiction. When a man shows you something with all the outward and visible signs of a wheelbarrow, and tells you it is an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to know what to say to him; and it is just as hard to know what to say when you are offered something like the following and told it as poetry, and poetry of a very high order. As the admirers of Walt Whitman always protest against his being judged of fragmentarily, we take the shortest poem we can find, instead of giving the queerest extract:\u2014</p><p><em>VISAGES.</em><br>Of the visages of things\u2014And of piercing through to the accepted hells beneath.<br>Of ugliness\u2014To me there is just as much in it as there is in beauty\u2014And now the <br>ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.<br>Of detected persons\u2014To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, worse than <br>undetected persons\u2014and are not in any respect worse than I am myself.<br>Of criminals\u2014To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal\u2014and any reputa-<br>ble person is also-and the President is also.</p><p>Now it may be that this is not balderdash, though we must confess to a strong suspicion that it is; but if it is poetry, all we can say is, we must find some other word for Shakspeare. Walt Whitman himself is much more candid on this point than his advocates. He certainly declares himself to be a poet, but at the same time he describes the offspring of his muse as a 'barbaric yawp.' We have no very definite idea as to the precise nature of a yawp, but, whatever it may be, it can scarcely be poetry.</p><p>We must do Mr. Rossetti the justice of admitting that he does not entirely rely on dogmatism in pleading the cause of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He does assign some few reasons why Walt Whitman should be accepted as 'the poet of the epoch.' In a paper which appeared in a weekly journal, he puts the claim on the rather curious ground of his being 'an initiator in the scheme and structure of his writings, and an individual of audacious personal ascendant.' But in the preface to the present volume he comes more plainly to the point. The reader, he says, is not to ask himself, or return any answer to the questions, whether or not Walt Whitman is like other poets, or whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of other poets, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in his work. 'Let the questions rather be\u2014Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel, and make me feel?' To each of these questions we should be disposed to answer simply 'No,' were it not that an unqualified negative is scarcely polite. We can see no reason for considering Walt Whitman powerful. Strong he may be, but it is only in the sense in which an onion is strong. His noise, bluster, and arrogance are no more indications of true strength than the swagger of the professional athlete at a country fair, who struts up and down the stage in salmon-coloured tights, and passes for a Hercules with the crowd from the way in which he feels his muscles in public. That he is American in one sense we must admit. He is something which no other country could have produced. He is American as certain forms of rowdyism and vulgarity, excrescences on American institutions, are American. But that he is American in the sense of being representative of American taste, intellect, or cultivation, we should be very sorry indeed to believe. New he certainly is, but it is only in his audacity, and in the abnormal structure of his poetry; there is not a new thought in his writings from beginning to end. As to the other questions, the answer must depend very much on individual temperament. Whether or not he himself feels we cannot tell, but, so far from being rousing or making his reader feel, we should say that with ninety-nine out of a hundred average readers Walt Whitman, taken in any quantity, would be found to be about as soporific a poet as ever produced a yawn. But even if all these questions could be answered in the affirmative\u2014even if we were to concede that Walt Whitman is powerful and new and American and rousing, and throw into the bargain what his friends invariably lay great stress upon, his magnificent physique and his irreproachable character in private life\u2014still all this, we submit, does not make him out to be a poet. To call a man a poet merely because he holds forth in rhapsodical style, about one man being as good as another, everything being all right, every one having a right 'to do as he dam pleases'\u2014if we may venture to quote the concise language of Transatlantic liberty\u2014and other dogmas of the same sort, is to confuse the functions of the poet and the stump orator; and generally, when Walt Whitman has any meaning at all, it amounts to no more than this. Very often he has no meaning whatever. In his fury he breaks out into a mere perspiration of words, and strings substantives together for pages on a stretch, the result being a something which is as much like poetry as an auctioneer's catalogue. To be sure there is scattered through his pages a vast amount of that vagueness which to some tastes has the true poetic charm. No doubt there are people who consider this sort of thing very fine:\u2014</p><p><em>OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</em><br>The skies of day and night\u2014colours, densities, forms\u2014May-be these are (as doubt-<br>less they are) only apparitions, and the real something has yet to be known;<br>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as from <br>my present point of view\u2014And might prove (as of course they would) naught <br>of what they appear, or naught anyhow, from entirely changed points of view.</p><p>But if it is very fine, then so is Miss Codger's outburst on being introduced to Elijah Pogram:\u2014</p><p>But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle, to which we give those titles, is a topic, spirit-searching, light-abandoned, much too vast to enter on.</p><p>But of course the special charm of Walt Whitman is that he is so\u2014what his admirers call\u2014unconventional; that is, that he says things which other people do not say, and in language which other people do not generally use. His unconventionality, however, is of a very cheap sort. It is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them. It is true that for the present we are spared the bolder strokes of his genius in this respect, but, as has been already mentioned, it is only for the present; and besides, Walt Whitman's grossness is not accidental, but constitutional. It arises partly from an insensibility to the difference between that which is naturally offensive and that which is not, partly from his peculiar theory of poetry. As it is a fundamental principle of his to recognize no law of any kind, and to submit to no restrictions of artistic propriety, it follows that with him all subjects are equally fit for poetic treatment. As Mr. Rossetti puts it, 'he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech,' and it is just this ignorance of his which, independently of other reasons, makes any attempt to set him up as a poetic model mischievous to the interests of literary art. It is not a question of squeamishness or hyper-sensitiveness. There is no prudery in objecting to nastiness, nor is there any originality, honesty, manliness, or courage in obtruding what even instinct teaches us to avoid. We cannot say, however, that we anticipate any serious injury to English or American literature from the influence or popularity of Walt Whitman's poetry, so long at least as people are courageous enough to use their common sense, and do not allow themselves to be led away by transcendental 'high-falutin' into pretending an admiration which they do not feel.</p>", "date": "1868", "year": 1868, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New Eclectic", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Poems by Walt Whitman].\" 1868.

Of pruned editions we have, generally speaking, an abhorrence; but in this case several chance expressions which Walt Whitman permitted himself were so very rude that his poems, as a whole, were deprived of that fair judgment which by rights belongs to every artistic work. Now we are far from considering Walt Whitman the merely blatant egotist which many English critics would have him to be; and we are glad that an opportunity presents itself to the ordinary English reader of estimating for himself the value of a writer who is almost new to us. Nor should we be surprised if the publication of this volume procure for its author a complete reversal of that vague opinion of him\u2014founded almost entirely on hearsay\u2014which has hitherto been current in this country. Walt Whitman is not an inflated Tupper. He is nebulous, mystical, sometimes incoherent, often laboriously 'distinct' without being 'clear'\u2014according to Leibnitz's fine definition\u2014but at no time does he fail to impress his reader with the sense that here is a man of power, a man capable of producing a definite impression on the mind. This is a result which never accrues from commonplace. Walt Whitman is, indeed, the Turner of poets. Sometimes you find a mere blurred mass of colour; then a piece of apparent commonplace; and then a picture which overawes the beholder. You may come to these studies with any mood of mind, and find it gratified. They will afford material for jokes; they will offer proof of the author's entire ignorance of or contempt for system and precedent; they will justify the wildest praise and the bitterest abuse. These are possibilities one does not find in commonplace; whatever the work is, it cannot be that. We have more than once seen the rather curious objection preferred against Walt Whitman, that the impression he produced on his admirers is simply owing to his talking largely and being incomprehensible. That, however, is a form of literature which so many modern writers have made us familiar, that every reader can at once deny the fact of any impression being produced by such easy authorship beyond that of insufferable weariness. The ordinary graces of poetry are not to be found in these poems. They are, as we have said, without system or precedent; the utterances of a man with an amazing belief, not in himself as an individual, but in himself as a spokesman of a new country and a new time.</p><p>'And I too of the Manahatta, singing thereof <br>\u2014and no less in myself than the whole<br> of the Manahatta in itself.'</p><p>Neither the dreams of Novalis nor the later speculations of Faraday are to be compared with that insistence of the mystic transmutation of spirit which this realistic and democratic poet sings. He does not worship the body, and passions, and infirmities of Walt Whitman; he worships these as all that he knows of humanity; and this is strikingly exemplified in a poem which has, unfortunately, but necessarily been omitted from the present edition. He seems to lose in his own mind all sense of the difference between the individual and the mass:\u2014</p><p>'All architecture is what you do to it when <br>you look upon it;<br>Did you think it was in the white or grey <br>stone? or the lines of the arches and <br>cornices?<br>All music is what awakes from you <em>when you <br>are reminded by the instruments.'</em></p><p>Anthropomorphism of a subtle and indefinite kind seems to be his principle theme; an anthropomorphism, however, differing widely from that of the sensationalists. According to him, 'objects gross and the unseen Soul are one;' while as to spiritual creations:\u2014</p><p>'We consider bibles and religions divine\u2014I <br>do not say they are not divine;<br>I say they have all grown out of you, and <br>may grow out of you still;<br>It is not they who give the life\u2014it is you <br>who give the life;<br>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or <br>trees from the earth, than they are shed <br>out of you.'</p><p>As a specimen of what may be called his 'prophetic manner,' take the following striking passage, full of a shadowy, but real and impressive force:\u2014</p><p>'What whispers are these, O lands, running <br>ahead of you, passing under the seas?<br>Are all nations communing? Is there go-<br>ing to be but one heart to the globe?<br>Is humanity forming en masse? \u2014for lo! <br>tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;<br>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, per-<br>haps a general divine war;<br>No one knows what will happen next\u2014such <br>portents fill the days and nights.<br>Years prophetical! the space ahead, as I <br>walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full <br>of phantoms;<br>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their <br>shapes around me;<br>This incredible rush and heat\u2014this strange <br>ecstatic fever of dreams, O years!<br>Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate <br>through me! (I know not whether I <br>sleep or wake!)<br>The performed America and Europe grow <br>dim, retiring in shadow behind me;<br>The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, <br>advance, advance upon me.'</p><p>Such is the cumbrous and ungainly 'method' of Walt Whitman's utterance; and that again is not unfrequently rendered more forbidding by an unnecessary diffuseness and what seems to us to be an intentional vagueness. That the writer of these poems\u2014if poems they are to be called\u2014is worthy of greater attention than has yet been paid him in England, we endeavored to show in a former article. For him, as for any other writer, we would bespeak a patient hearing. The material which he offers us is so novel and so bold, that we are ready to distrust any immediate critical estimate, and would fain see Walt Whitman pass into the crucible of popular reading. Mr. Rossetti, we think, has done his editorial work\u2014in this case rendered peculiarly difficult\u2014well; and we recommend the reader to pay careful attention to Mr. Rossetti's appreciate[ve] and yet impartial judgment of Whitman in the preface to the book. We should have preferred to the engraved portrait of Walt Whitman in the present volume a copy of the striking and picturesque photo of him lately taken in New York; but even the former will give the English reader some slight indication of the poet's features and expression. In other respects the edition is nicely got up; and we have no hesitation in commending it as an excellent index to the writings of a man who cannot be overlooked.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217 Poems by Walt Whitman.

While admitting all that was wild, disorderly, and extravagant in these writings, we did justice to the many high qualities they possessed, spoke of them as the most thoroughly national and characteristic poetry to which America had yet given birth, and anticipated for them, when the first feelings of dislike, which the violation of all received models had occasioned were repressed, a large measure of regard among the more cultivated classes of English readers. At the time we wrote, the volume containing Whitman's poems was one of the rarest in England. A few scattered copies could be found, belonging principally to those who had received the work in their capacity of reviewers. We spoke warmly of the desirability of placing it within the reach of a certain tolerably extensive class of readers, and discussed the feasibility of an English reprint. Sooner than we anticipated has such reprint come. It has taken, moreover, the form we expected a first edition of Whitman to bear;\u2014a form not in itself attractive to scholars and students, but such as in the present case was alone to be expected, and such as the exceeding taste of the editor has rendered as little offensive as possible to the haters of expurgated editions. Many motives induce us to recur for a brief while to the works of Whitman, to do which the appearance of the first English edition affords a favourable opportunity. Enough has not yet been said about the man, and the edition itself is a novelty in English literature, deserving on its own account a few words of comment. Not, however, in the few phrases that follow, nor in many more, for which we have not space, should we hope to do justice to that remarkable kosmos, Walt Whitman. He is not a man to be easily dismissed. A few glibly-spoken phrases will not describe him or his work. His faults and excellences are of the kind least commonly encountered, and have phases enough to render just and satisfactory criticism a task of more than usual difficulty. Walt Whitman is undoubtedly a great man. His position as a poet is not likely to be conceded without much dispute. Conservatives in poetry will shrink from utterances which appear to defy all known canons, and possess scarcely one of the gifts hitherto judged indispensable to verse. Unreflective readers will see nothing but a harsh and over-daring Tupper. Those even, whose sympathies are broad, and who shrink from subjecting all poetry to the tape, may pause ere they bestow the title of verse on these strong and often inharmonious outpourings. But no thinking reader will dispute that he is in the presence of a man and a thinker. Whitman is entitled to rank with those men whose works are the scholar's especial delight. His mind is of the same order with that of Rabelais or Montaigne. Rightly to understand him, however, it is necessary to transport oneself in idea from the over-crowded and, in one sense, over-civilised world of Europe, to the great continent whose first seer he is. American life and institutions have impregnated Whitman's soul. American air has saturated his lungs. He knows nothing of old-world notions and conventions; laughs at them when he hears of them, or passes them by as things unworthy of a thought. He is an American, Manhattanese, a democrat. The world he lives in is untroubled with questions of kingcraft or priestcraft. Human nature, in the manifold developments which in its fight in city or backwood it assumes, he knows and loves. Comradeship is his motto. Men who work and love like he are his brothers. The question of success never enters into his calculations. He sings forgotten or unknown heroes as soon as those whose names are foremost in the scroll of fame. The imperfections of the human nature he contemplates are as well worthy of study as its perfections. Nothing about manhood is vile or unclean. His contempt for the assumptions of philosophy is not greater nor less than his disregard of the dogmatism of authority. He is the most pantheistic of pantheists. The God he worships reveals himself in all places, even where Egyptian or Phoenician would not have sought him. The divine in the human he understands and worships. Nothing with Whitman is unfit for the uses of poetry. Mr. Buchanan is not more ready to descend for the subject of his poetry to street or slum. Wordsworth is not more enraptured of solitude, or in closer communion with nature. His principal theme is, however, manhood; first, as he sees it in the individual that is himself, next as he sees it in the world at large, the American world that is. 'Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse: I say the form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male, I sing.' His book is, as Mr. Rossetti admirably observes, the poem of personality and democracy. It is strong, passionate, rhapsodical even, and yet pervaded with matter-of-fact plainness of speech. It is extravagant at times both in reality and ideality. One thing, at least, it never is\u2014unhealthy or morbid. The edition of Whitman's poems which Mr. Rossetti has published does not pretend to completeness. It is but a book of extracts. In its class, however, it is a model. Never before has the public had a volume of extracts in which it might depend with greater confidence upon the taste of him who chose. Our own dislike to selections is not greater than that which Mr. Rossetti proclaims. If, however, there are books of which one should know much while one cannot afford him to know all, we should like always to have Mr. Rossetti to taste and select for us. Mr. Rossetti announces his volume as intended rather to herald the entire work than to render it unnecessary. He has felt it expedient to give the public some knowledge of the first truly national poet America has produced, and has determined not to frighten away the general reader by printing the poems in which the writer flies in the face of prejudices entertained by a large portion of Englishmen. But Mr. Rossetti is no Bowdler. He has given us many poems entire. Others he has entirely omitted. This we at once admit is the only principle upon which work of this kind can be done, and yet find favour with thoughtful readers. Into the question of the value of English prejudice Mr. Rossetti does not enter. His few remarks are explanatory of his motives, neither deprecatory nor justificatory. The greatest works of all times, from the earliest literature of Greek and Hebrew, to the latest of France and England, are offensive to English prudery. He has given to the English world those writings of a great and unknown writer, which it may read without being shocked. If after reading these the public wants more, and cares to risk the chance of being shocked, it can obtain them. That is its own affair. Only in the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass, which Mr. Rossetti has most judiciously included in his volume, are one or two passages left out, and these he had the author's permission to omit. For it is a fact, creditable alike to editor and publisher, that this work is published with the express sanction of the author, who will receive a royalty on every copy sold, and who has accorded liberty for the sale of the volume in America, wherein at present the earlier editions of Whitman are scarce and expensive. In Mr. Rossetti's preface\u2014a model of grave thoughtful criticism, and free and elegant English\u2014we have a few particulars of Whitman's biography; a description of his personal appearance, and an account of the reception which attended the first publication of his works in America. Some account is also given of his heroic conduct during the late war. The remainder is composed of criticisms upon Whitman's works, and an explanation of the theory of his workmanship. A portrait of the author, very admirably engraven, accompanies the volume, which is unusually elegant and attractive in appearance. In our previous account of Whitman, to which the present notice is intended as an appendix, we quoted as liberally from the published works as our space would permit. We are now, accordingly, exonerated from the necessity of supporting by extracts the opinions we have pronounced. We regret that we cannot quote one passage from the prose preface of which we have spoken. The whole of the preface is wonderfully powerful, sonorous, and trumpet-like, and is in itself sufficient to render, a desirable possession the volume in which it appears. As an exposition of Whitman's views of art it is profoundly interesting. We trust that now that Whitman's works are easily accessible, few Englishmen will care to leave them unread. For ourselves, we confess to sharing the opinion eloquently expressed by his English editor, 'His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken\u2014that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere the uttermost orators of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>\u2217 <em>Poems of Walt Whitman</em>.

Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti One Vol., pp. 406. J.C. Hotten.</p><p>Opening this book has been to us a revelation. Reading it has yielded us exquisite pleasure. The remembrance of it sweetens life. Echoes from it haunt us in the thick of our occupations, 'under the shade of melancholy boughs,' in the throng of the streets, at our meals, in the midst of our conversations, anywhere, everywhere, under the likeliest and the unlikeliest circumstances. Before the volume now under notice came into our hands, the name of Walt Whitman was certainly known to us, but that was all. Now that we have read these selections\u2014observe, these selections\u2014from his 'Chants Democratic,' from his Drum Taps, from his Leaves of Grass, from his 'Songs of Parting,' we have learnt to love that name of his, it has become to us a synonym of pleasure, suggestive of thoughts, emotions, aspirations, expressed as in a new language, and, once so expressed, never afterwards to be altogether forgotten. To William Michael Rossetti, as the selecter of these poems, we are not simply, in old-fashioned phrase, beholden, we are not merely in courtlier terms his most obedient, we are his very gratefully, and that, moreover, in heartfelt truthfulness. Already in the columns of the clever but now dead and gone Chronicle, under date 6th July, 1867, the editor of this henceforth to us cherished volume of Walt Whitman's Poems had sounded the trumpet of admiration in praise of that particular poet of America. Here, however, he has made good, in every sense, his high, and, as it might have seemed to some, extravagant commendations. Of the justice of the estimate thus enunciated, these poems yield absolute demonstration. Apart from the selection now given to us by Mr Rossetti, we are desirous that it should be understood at once, however, by our readers, that we know nothing whatever of the writings of Walt Whitman. This we would especially premise. And for a sufficient reason. According to a very general rumour even over here in England, according to the showing of even so enthusiastic an appreciator of his genius as Mr Rossetti has (happily for us all) shown himself to be\u2014Walt Whitman has written things that his own most ardent admirers would willingly let die. Yet, of all this, the volume now in our hand, here submitted to our consideration, bears not a particle of evidence. The leering satyrs have been scared away from among the beautiful umbrage. The dregs lurk no longer in the limpid draught placed at our lips. We can quaff without a qualm. There is no canker in the rose-wreath as it is thus brought within our reach\u2014it is all fragrance and dripping with dew. Not a taint is here, in bloom, or foliage, or fruit. The very atmosphere investing these poems is all purity, like the breath of morning. And yet\u2014though we never should have conjectured as much from these poems themselves\u2014the Collective Writings of Walt Whitman must indubitably be tainted, flawed, polluted\u2014and that, too, with a taint, a flaw, a pollution in no conceivable way to be extenuated. Mr Rossetti himself sets forth in regard to the incriminated poems (all of which he has carefully omitted in the process of making his selection) not one word, not one hint of extenuation. He says, indeed, that he considers 'that most of them would be much better away.' And, whatever else can be said of the editor of the present volume as a critic of poetic literature, it certainly cannot be said of him that he is a purist. 'Indecencies, improprieties, deforming erudities' there are, he tells us, scattered, it may even be abundantly scattered, here and there, over the Writings of Walt Whitman. Such they are acknowledged to be, in so many words, even by the critic thanks to whose judicious hands those damning blemishes have been discarded. Of their existence at all, we only know, now, by their own evil reputation. They themselves are not here. Nevertheless this selection is in no respect what we should call, in the ordinary acceptation of the words, an Expurgated Edition. There is here no emasculation. The poems that are given are given in their entirety. Mere parts have been nowhere selected. Abbreviations, elisions, excisions, the Editor has shrunk from as from impertinences. He has done his task well and wisely. And yet, task it can hardly be called\u2014true labour of love as it has been (and no wonder) throughout. Although containing within it 'a little less,' we are told 'that [sic] half the entire bulk of Whitman's poetry,' this one volume affords a comprehensive view of the writer's genius in its integrity. It is no broken gem that is here placed in our hands for examination, but\u2014'one entire and perfect chrysolite.' Before commenting upon Walt Whitman's poetical productions, however, so far as those are here brought within our survey, a word or two as to the man himself. Abraham Lincoln's exclamation on seeing him was\u2014'Well, he looks like a man!' Nor can that exclamation be wondered at when one comes to sum up his characteristics. Lofty in stature, admirably well proportioned, of vigorous strength, of abounding health\u2014forty-nine years of age on the last day of next month\u2014his eyes of a light blue, his complexion florid, his beard fleecy and flowing, but already quite grey\u2014cheerful and masculine in appearance\u2014having a predilection for the society of common people\u2014intensely fond of fine music, and with a great natural taste for works of art\u2014absolutely indifferent 'as to either praise or blame of what he writes'\u2014such, in brief, is Walt Whitman. Born on the 31st of May, 1819, at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, in the state of New York, somewhere about thirty miles from the great American capital and outport\u2014he is but now in the prime or meridian of his manhood, though already old-looking in spite of his health, of his wholesome out-door life, his temperate habits, and his vigorous constitution. A schoolboy up to thirteen, afterwards a compositor, then a country teacher, then a press writer, then a newspaper editor, then a master printer, then (like his father) a carpenter and builder, then, throughout the Great Civil War, to the Northern Army, what Miss Nightingale was to the British Army at Scutari throughout the War in the Crimea. And, yet all along, and at last wholly and solely, what he is now for the rest of his days\u2014a Poet. Before considering him as such, it is but justice to remark of him in his capacity as a practical philanthropist when attending the poor soldiers all through that tremendous struggle between North and South, between the Federals and the Confederates in America, that 'It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded.' Honour, therefore, to the brave, true heart, if only in remembrance of that one recorded fact in his history\u2014a fact evidencing that Walt Whitman not only 'looks' but acts 'like a man.' Turning our glance, however, from the man himself to his productions, to those Poems of his which have been here selected for us from his 'Songs of Parting,' his Leaves of Grass, his Drum Taps, and so on\u2014one peculiarity is at once especially noticeable in regard to them, and that is their startling, intense, and absolute originality. In their manner, they are unlike any other poems that have ever previously made their appearance. As a rule, they are rhymeless. But, always, always they are rhythmical, and yet rhythmical after a manner peculiarly and exceptionally their own. The lines are of any length\u2014sometimes abbreviated to a little more than a monosyllable\u2014occasionally running out to the extent of half-a-dozen alexandrines. Now standing, as one might say, on one foot, and that a-tip-toe\u2014now running along upon as many feet as those of a centipede. But\u2014with all this whimsicality and abandon of manner, with all this wild defiance of the hitherto dominant laws of poetical, and, for that matter even at times of rhetorical, construction\u2014O the charm, the grace, the tenderness, the pathos, the abounding and captivating beauties scattered broadcast, with a lavish hand, with an affluent fancy, with the royal prodigality of genius, over these pages of true poetry! Nor can the daring originality thus manifested by Walt Whitman in the mere manner of his composition be regarded as so wholly unexampled. As has been admirably well asked\u2014</p><p>'Was genius awed by Aristotle's rules<br>When Shakspeare burst the cobwebs of the schools?'</p><p>Flinging to the winds of heaven all the precedents of literature, this new poet of the New World, a poet intensely sui generis, one racy of the soil from which he has sprung, carves out his own way with a pen as trenchant as an axe, and goes upon that way of his rejoicing. About the only one rhymed passage in the whole of this otherwise quite rhymeless volume of poetry, is the opening of the song in celebration of the broad-axe in the 'Chants Democratic.' And, having but just now\u2014in total forgetfulness at the moment, alike of that especial passage and of that particular song\u2014likened Walt Whitman's pen, in the trenchant sweep of it, to an axe, such as it might be seen gleaming and crashing when wielded in the grip of a backwoodsman of thews and sinews like his own\u2014upon our sudden remembrance immediately afterwards of his own words, the simile appears more than ever most appropriate. For, thus it is that Walt Whitman, in his 'Song of the Broad Axe,' apostrophises that\u2014</p><p>'Weapon, shapely, naked, wan;<br>Head from the mother's bowels drawn!<br>Wooded flesh and metal bone; limb only one,<br> and lip only one!<br>Grey-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve<br> produced from a light seed sown!<br>Resting the grass amid and upon,<br>To be leaned, and to lean on.'</p><p>A pen no less potent, keen, piercing, than such a broad axe, 'to be leaned and to lean on,' resting the grass [Leaves of Grass] amid and upon'\u2014is, most assuredly, for us the pen of Walt Whitman. Otherwise than in one fragmentary instance like the foregoing, the book is, as we have said, altogether rhymeless. Wonderfully rhythmical throughout, though in lines of the most oddly varying lengths, the poems of Walt Whitman\u2014when the reader has once passed the Rubicon\u2014exercise over that initiated reader's mind a potent and irresistible fascination. The Rubicon must be passed, however, as a preliminary, as the first and all-essential preliminary of initiation. Meaning by that, simply, that any one coming to the examination of Walt Whitman's poems with a view to their complete appreciation, must begin by, we won't say taking this and that for granted, we won't even say by making such and such allowances, for, so expressing ourselves, we might seem to be slighting the high inherent claims to respect of a great original writer, such as Walt Whitman: instead of that we will say then simply\u2014that the all-essential preliminary we are alluding to is one purely of concession. Concede to Whitman the fashion of his verse\u2014concede to him his terse but never bald realism\u2014concede to him his exotic verbiage, his coinage of words occasionally, with a daring disregard alike of the laws of syntax and of philology\u2014and the spell of the magician is felt at once and for ever! We are within the circle of his poetic incantations! He 'hath his will' thenceforth\u2014as he lists\u2014at his own pleasure over our hearts, our emotions, our imaginations. As exemplars, to begin with, of his magical power in mere word-painting\u2014take almost haphazard a single line or verse picked out here and there from the midst of his descriptions:\u2014</p><p>'Evening\u2014me in my room\u2014the setting sun,<br>The setting summer sun shining in my open windows, <br>showing the swarm of flies, suspended, balancing <br>in the air in the centre of the room, darting athwart, <br>up and down, casting swift shadows in specks on <br>the opposite wall, where the shine is.'</p><p>'The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after <br>the storm is lulled.'</p><p>'Me observing the spiral flight of two little yellow <br>butterflies shuffling between each other, ascending <br>high in the air.</p><p>'And the fish suspending themselves below there\u2014and <br>the beautiful curious liquid.'</p><p>'In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, <br>with a wind-dapple here and there.'</p><p>These word paintings of Whitman's sometimes pass by their very vividness into whimsicalities, yet are, for all that, wondrous word-paintings nevertheless: as where he speaks of\u2014</p><p>' . . .dabs of music;<br>Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of <br>the great organ.'</p><p>His word-painting power goes with him everywhere. Into the ship-building yard, for example, where we see with him, as if we, too, were there\u2014</p><p>'The butter-coloured chips flying off in great flakes, <br>and slivers.</p><p>It goes with him, and we with it and with him through even the swinging of a door\u2014</p><p>'The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed <br>and in haste.</p><p>Sometimes the secret of it lies even in a word\u2014</p><p>'The dim-lit church and the shuddering organ .'</p><p>Or, again, as where conjuring up shapes before him in his reverie, he speaks, among others, of\u2014</p><p>'The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by<br> sneaking footsteps.</p><p>Or, yet more even, where brooding over many exquisite imaginings, he says most oddly and whimsically\u2014</p><p>'They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.'</p><p>Or, again in the same way, when, by one subtle word, we note the last agonised kiss of bereaved affection, when\u2014</p><p>'The <em>twitching</em> lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying.'</p><p>The merest specks and atoms of beauty, however, are these little word-pictures noticeable in casual lines and phrases in Walt Whitman's poetry. Immeasurably more noteworthy are the large humanity and the wide philosophy evidenced and inculcated by his utterances. His cry is that of Happiness and of Adoration\u2014</p><p>'For I do not see one imperfection in the universe.'</p><p>Another while he declares\u2014</p><p>'That all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, <br>each as profound as any.'</p><p>And another while he ejaculates:\u2014</p><p>'The sun and stars that float in the open air;<br>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it\u2014surely the drift <br>of them is something grand!'</p><p>Adding\u2014</p><p>'I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and <br>that it is happiness.'</p><p>Again, he is full of wonderment at the abounding wonders around him, among others at\u2014</p><p>'The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and <br>the wonders that fill each minute of time forever.'</p><p>The wonder of wonders to him, however\u2014the glory and consolation of his life\u2014(the enunciation of which, of the joy and solace of which to fellow mortals, is among the most dearly-cherished aspirations of his ambition)\u2014the one great end worth living for, being, according to Walt Whitman\u2014Death. Thus he exclaims\u2014</p><p>'And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it<br> may be turned to beautiful results\u2014and I will show <br>that nothing can happen more beautiful than death.</p><p>It is thus that he speaks in his 'Song at Sunset' of\u2014'the superb vistas of Death.' It is thus that in his poem addressed 'To one Shortly to Die,' he closes it not in pity but in felicitation\u2014</p><p>'I do not commiserate\u2014I congratulate you.'</p><p>It is thus he sings exultantly\u2014</p><p>'I shall go with the rest.<br>We cannot be stopped at a given point\u2014that is no satis-<br>faction,<br>To show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space <br>of time\u2014that is no satisfaction;<br>We must have the indestructible breed of the best, regard-<br>less of time.<br>If otherwise, all these things come but to ashes of dung<br>If maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are <br>betrayed!<br>Then indeed suspicion of death.<br>Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death I should <br>die now:<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well suited to-<br>ward annihilation?'</p><p>Consonant with his rapturous exultation in the thought of Death, consonant with his homage for the perfection of the universe, are his absolute confidence in the reality of the future, and his profound sense that all that is holiest has never yet in any way been adequately realised or appreciated:\u2014</p><p>'I say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are<br> for religion's sake.<br>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough;<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, <br>and how certain the future is.'</p><p>Hence he sings, hence he is a Poet, hence he undertakes in these poems of his to write the 'evangel-poem of comrades and love.' Akin to his overflowing delight in the thought of the Now and the Hereafter, are the largeness and the depth, the exquisite self-abnegation and the all-embracing comprehensiveness of his humanity. To the very dregs and scum and squalor of the evil streets of a bad city he cries out\u2014by a subtle violation of grammar, as it seems to us, i.e., in the verb we have italicised in the subjoined quotation, appealing to them as though he spoke with them from their own level\u2014</p><p>'Because you are greasy and pimpled, or that you was <br>drunk, or a thief,<br>Or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now,<br>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, <br>and never saw your name in print,<br>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?'</p><p>At the City Dead House in his 'Leaves of Grass,' we see him standing\u2014gazing\u2014yearning, in tenderest pity and commiseration over\u2014what? over 'an outcast form,' indeed, over the body of a poor dead prostitute\u2014</p><p>'The divine woman, her body\u2014I see her body\u2014I look on <br>it alone,<br>That house, once full of passion and beauty\u2014all else I <br>notice not;<br>No stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor <br>odours morbific impress me;<br>But the house alone\u2014that wondrous house\u2014that delicate <br>fair house\u2014that ruin!<br>That immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings <br>ever built,<br>Or white domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure sur-<br>mounted\u2014or all the old high-spired cathedrals,<br>That little house alone more than them all\u2014poor desperate <br>house!<br>Fair, fearful work! tenement of a Soul! itself a Soul!<br>Unclaimed, avoided house! take one breath from my <br>tremulous lips;<br>Take one tear, dropped aside as I go, for thought of you,<br>Dead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! <br>crushed!<br>House of life\u2014ere while talking and laughing\u2014but, oh, <br>poor house! dead even then;<br>Months, years, an echoing, garnished house\u2014but dead <br>dead, dead.'</p><p>So wide, so profound, so insatiable are the yearnings of this great heart for sympathy, that on turning to his poem on 'Envy' what do we find to be the cause of his Envy? Not a perusal of the records of heroism, not the thought of Mighty Generals or Men in Power, but\u2014when he reads of the brotherhood of lovers\u2014</p><p>'How through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, <br>long and long,<br>Through youth, and through middle and through old age, <br>how unfaltering, how affectionate, and faithful they <br>were,<br>Then I am pensive\u2014I hastily put down the book, and <br>walk away, filled with the bitterest envy.'</p><p>In illustration of the same thought, or rather of the same tender, yearning for sympathy, read his commemoration of 'Parting Friends,'\u2014</p><p>'Two simple men I saw to-day on the pier, in the midst <br>of the crowd parting the parting of dear friends;<br>The one to remain hung on the other's neck and pas-<br>sionately kissed him,<br>Whilst the one to depart tightly pressed the one to re-<br>main in his arms.'</p><p>Or, still more, the Poet's apostrophe 'To a Stranger':\u2014</p><p>'Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look <br>upon you.'</p><p>Most of all this yearning for sympathy shines forth when it is recognised 'Among the Multitude;' when, in other words, the Poet foresees it, thus\u2014</p><p>'Among the men and women, the multitude<br>I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,<br>Acknowledging none else\u2014not parent, wife, husband, <br>brother, child, any nearer than I am:<br>Some are baffled\u2014But that one is not\u2014that one knows <br>me.<br>Ah! lover and perfect equal!<br>I meant that you should discover me so, by my faint <br>indirections;<br>And I, when I meet you, mean to discover you by the <br>like in you.'</p><p>So, too, he sees them afar off in foreign lands, those breasts with whom his own could sympathise could they be brought into communion:\u2014</p><p>'O I know we should be brethren and lovers\u2014<br>I know I should be happy with them.'</p><p>It were idle, however, attempting to afford the reader any adequate notion of these poems as a symmetrical whole, through mere fragmentary or incidental quotations like those to which a reviewer is necessarily restricted. It would be worse than the proffering of the specimen-brick by the house-vendor in Hierocles\u2014it would be the production of a handful of splinters chipped off the Apollo Belvidere, or of a stray finger torn from the Venus de Medici. Whitman's Poems\u2014as is the case with every true work of art\u2014must be viewed each in its entirety before there can be any hope whatever of their accurate appreciation. So regarded, they cannot fail by any possibility, as we conceive, to win the admiration to which they are so signally entitled. After this fashion alone\u2014that is to say at once, searchingly and comprehensively\u2014ought at any time to be examined, that noble apostrophe, beginning at page 310, To Death, that profound and heart-penetrating epitome of Human Life, commencing at page 356, that no less effective and affecting poem upon Night and Death which opens at page 266, but above all the magnificent Nocturn upon the Death of President Lincoln beginning at page 301, and, what is to our mind even finer than that, the exquisitely pathetic and pre-eminently beautiful celebration by Walt Whitman of the first revelation to himself of his own powers and future path in life as a poet, when, as a little barefooted child, he stood upon the sea-shore one evening and far on into the night, listening to the lamentations of the song-bird bereaved of its mate, himself drowned in tears as he listened\u2014standing, there, entranced in the moonlight drinking in the music of that delicate and tender death-chant! Never before was the song of a bird so put into human language\u2014never before was the rapturous anguish of the poetic summons so articulated. It is B\u00e9ranger's Ma Vocation repeated: when\u2014speaking of himself as a mere infant\u2014the old Chansonnier sings to us\u2014</p><p>'Une plainte touchante,<br>De ma bouche sortit;<br>Le bon Dieu me dit: Chante,<br>Chante, pauvre petit.'</p><p>And now that Whitman has sung (and is still, for that matter, happily singing in the midst of us) in obedience to the holy mandate by which every true poet is at the outset made aware of his vocation, he has as profound a sense of the reality of that summons, and of the consequent permanence or security of his reputation as a Poet, as ever Horace had when proudly forecasting his own poetic immortality. Assuming to himself at once his right position in English Literature, he has even, as it happens, like almost all the more remarkable poets in our language, selected, unconsciously it may be, but unmistakably his own special emblem! Henceforth, as it seems to us, his inalienably and no other's! A floral emblem to be worn by him from this time forth as conspicuously as the sprig of bloom fastened of old on the helmet of the first Plantaganet. In this, as we have just now intimated, it is with him, as it has been before him with his compeer and his congeners, the majority of the great poets in our language. Has not Moore, for example, in this way taken to himself for ever as his the shamrock\u2014and Scott the purpling heather\u2014and Campbell the red velvet strings of love-lies-bleeding? Has not Keats his sprig of basil\u2014and Blair his branch of funereal yew\u2014and Chatterton his trail of lamenting willow? But that Burns, again, according [to] his own showing, was endowed by his Muse (the Muse of Scotland) with the glistening bough of the holly, he might perchance have contested with Dan Chaucer the latter's now undisputed right to the possession as his of the darling blossom of the daisy. As indubitably, moreover, as the daisy belongs to Chaucer and the holly to Burns\u2014so has Shelley assumed to himself the sensitive plant, and Wordsworth the little celandine and the daffodils, and Cowper the rose and the water lily, and Leigh Hunt the flowering branch of May, and Tennyson the gorgeous blossom of the passion flower, if only by right of the 'splendid tear' shed upon it at the garden porch in 'Maud,' and Milton 'the yellow cowslip and the pale primrose,' and Shakespeare, for that matter, almost every bloom of the parterre or of the wilderness. And, as it has been with those, so it is now and henceforth with this true American Poet Walt Whitman, who has made the lilac\u2014the fragrant, blueish-pink blossoms of the lilac\u2014his own completely. Turning the leaves of these poems, the reader may say before the book is closed as the Poet himself says or rather sings with a sort of rapture\u2014</p><p>'Yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me.'</p><p>For it blossoms, and breathes forth its haunting perfume, and verdantly unfolds its delicate heart-shaped leaves, again and again, all through these pages\u2014more especially in the great Nocturn on the Death of President Lincoln. And so, with the fragrance of the lilacs in our nostrils, and with the song of the lamenting bird in our ears, and with the thought in our hearts of the manly poet himself going his sickening rounds in the ghastly hospitals, all through the great American War, accompanied, as he went down the wards, by his attendant, bearing sponge, and pail, and lint, and ointment, for the cleansing and the binding up of many loathsome wounds, we close this beautiful volume with a renewal of our grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Rossetti, and with a benison to Walt Whitman.</p>", "date": "April 17 1868", "year": 1868, "creator": "William Charles Mark Kent", "publication": "The London Sun", "citation": "Kent, William Charles Mark [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman's Poems.\" 17 April 1868.

Englishmen know nothing\u2014excepting the very few cultivated Englishmen who have crossed the Atlantic, met the author, and learned to admire him and his books. Mr. William Michael Rossetti has been for some time what may be called a disciple of Whitman. If he did not absolutely discover him, he was at least one of the very first who heard of the discovery. Here is the result: a volume, a selection of Mr. Whitman's poems, containing probably one-half of what he has written, and that half not necessarily the best. And here it must be said, that having read the volume with great interest\u2014for Rumour had been busy\u2014and with deep gratification, for the present we must suffer description to assume the place of criticism, since one reading is quite insufficient, and time is required in order that the strangeness of the beauty may be absorbed and assimilated, before any proper estimate of it could be formed. It is strange, at the outset, to find that the other half of the author's writings is so disfigured by violation of morality and decency, as to be rather too much for the English reader; and, stranger still, to hear Mr. Rossetti praying for a complete edition. As far as can be made out, Mr. Whitman considers everything noble, because of divine origin, and everything a fair subject for words. Therefore he goes on about matters fleshly, spiritual, and mixed\u2014always calling spades spades, in a fashion not to be tolerated by ordinary nerves. It will be observed that the volume is called 'Poems,' and it is certain that not one man in a thousand would so describe them. And yet we can say that there is not one page which is not thoroughly poetic. The simple thing is, not that there is no rhyme\u2014which is, of course, unessential; but that there is no rhythm, no measure, no attempt at complying with any of the universally known demands of versification, and which we are still simple enough to consider one of the absolute demands of poetry. A skin of kid is not a kid glove. This is a dilemma which the ordinary English reader will find difficult to get over; but he must read Mr. Rossetti's prefatory sketch, which is in every way an excellent piece of writing from an accomplished man, and which seems to err only on the side of absolute infatuation. Mr. Rossetti insists that it must be taken as an altogether new poetry: as something as distinctively American as Niagara and the Rocky Mountains, and having no more in common with English poetry than Niagara has with the dripping well at Hastings, or the Rocky Mountains with Primrose-hill! A specimen or two of these strange productions shall be given; but it is proper to say that they are amongst the most musical we can find, and the easiest to understand. The author is always mystical\u2014always democratic\u2014always speaking in ghastly praise of death. But he roams over every or any kind of subject, and seems always to be in 'communion with nature.' He chatters with the birds, and is sometimes as incomprehensible. And he hurls large sayings at the mountains, who echo back peal after peal, and all of which enthusiasts are humbly entreated to suppose that the author understands! Here is an exquisitely musical little piece, the commencement of President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn:\u2014</p><p>When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,<br>And the great star early drooped in the western sky in <br>the night,<br>I mourned\u2026and yet shall mourn with ever-returning <br>spring.<br>O ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;<br>Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,<br>And thought of him I love.</p><p>O powerful, western, fallen star!<br>O shades of night! O moody, tearful night!<br>O great star disappeared! O the black murk that hides <br>the star!<br>O cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul <br>of me!<br>O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul!</p><p>In the door-yard, fronting an old farm-house, near the <br>whitewashed palings,<br>Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>With many a pointed blossom, rising delicate, with the <br>perfume strong I love,<br>With every leaf a miracle; and from this bush in the<br> door-yard,<br>With delicate-coloured blossoms, and heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>A sprig, with its flower, I break.</p><p>In the swamp, in secluded recesses,<br>A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.<br>Solitary, the thrush,<br>The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settle-<br>ments,<br>Sings by himself a song.<br>Song of the bleeding throat!<br>Death's outlet song of life\u2014for well, dear brother, I <br>know,<br>If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would surely die.</p><p>Page after page of this curiously poetical 'Funeral Hymn' might be reprinted here, for the reader's pleasure; but our object is to provoke, not to appease, the taste. Here is another short piece which is perfect\u2014that is, complete.

Selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti (Hotten.)</p><p>THE selections here given from the poems of Walt Whitman form, we are told, nearly half of his entire works. Mr. Rossetti's objects in the present compilation have been, first, to exclude every poem that could fairly be deemed offensive; and, secondly, to include whatever, being free from just or unjust censure on the ground of decorum, is at the same time highest as poetry and most characteristic of the writer. The editor has wisely, and with a proper reverence for one in whose genius he believes, refrained from culling what are called 'beauties' from such poems as might be thought objectionable. He has hacked and spoilt no piece by depriving it of the unity and continuity which make it vital; and thus, though we have not here the whole of Whitman, what we have is genuinely his own. It follows from the process adopted that we are not now called upon to weigh the accusations which have been brought against the writer in America for his license of expression in morals (morals being, of course, to be understood in a special and restricted sense), but simply to examine his credentials as a poet.</p><p>In a Preface which, on the whole, is written with his usual discernment and happiness of exposition, Mr. Rossetti observes of Whitman, 'He may be termed formless by those who, not without much reason to show for themselves, are wedded to the established forms and ratified refinements of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to enlarge the canon till it includes so great and startling a genius, rather than to draw it close and exclude him.' We see, however, no reason why the usual definition of an art should be changed for the sake of embracing in its limits one who might otherwise stand without them. The question now at issue, is not whether Mr. Whitman is a great thinker, but whether he is a great poet. Now, by common consent the vital constituents of poetry are emotion and imagination. By imagination we mean the power of conceiving ideas and of representing them by adequate symbols to the senses.</p><p>Judged by this admitted test, what shall we say of Walt Whitman? That some entire poems in this collection, and many scattered passages in other poems, bear the test triumphantly, few, if qualified to judge, will doubt. On the other hand, we have here many pages (probably the greater number) of which it would be difficult to maintain that they are poetry in any sense of that word which has yet been accepted. Thus, in the address 'To Working Men,' who can say that, however exalted by the prevailing idea of the piece, any item in the following catalogue, with the one exception marked in italics, is in itself poetical?\u2014</p><p>House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin- roofing, shingle-dressing,Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flagging <br>of side-walks by flaggers,<br>The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal- <br>kiln and brick-kiln,<br>Coal-mines, and all that is down there,\u2014the lamps in the <br>darkness, echoes, songs, what meditations, what <br>vast native thoughts looking through smutched faces,<br>Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the river-<br> banks\u2014men around feeling the melt with huge <br>crowbars\u2014lumps of ore, the due combining of ore, <br>limestone, coal\u2014the blast-furnace and the puddling- <br>furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom of the melt at <br>last\u2014the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron,<br> the strong, clean-shaped T-rail for railroads;<br>Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house, <br>steam-saws, the great mills and factories.</p><p>Even in the composition called 'A Poet,' which, besides its high strain of thought, is very interesting as a revelation of Whitman's individuality, there is far more of theory than of imagination. When he writes of the poet\u2014</p><p>Him all wait for\u2014him all yield up to\u2014his word is deci-<br>sive and final,<br>Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, <br>as amid light,<br>Him they immerse, and he immerses them.<br>Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the land-<br>scape, people, animals,<br>The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet <br>ocean (so tell I my morning's romanza),<br>All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever <br>money will buy,<br>The best farms\u2014others toiling and planting, and he <br>unavoidably reaps,<br>The noblest and costliest cities\u2014others grading and build-<br>ing, and he domiciles there,<br>Nothing for anyone, but what is for him\u2014near and far <br>are for him,\u2014the ships in the offing,<br>The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if <br>they are for anybody\u2014</p><p>the reader may or may not find in the lines truth of doctrine, but he assuredly will not find beauty of expression. Turning, on the contrary, to the pieces named respectively 'Assimilations,' 'Burial,' 'The Waters,' 'A Ship,' 'President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn,' and 'A Word out of the Sea,' he will scarcely deny that they possess striking truth and beauty of description, and, still better, that subtle and informing power which unobtrusively converts all outward things into symbols, just as the soul makes for itself a symbol of the body which it pervades and rules. This unconscious power of symbolization\u2014quite distinct from, and even opposed to, the mechanical ingenuity of allegory\u2014is nowhere more delightfully evinced by Whitman than in 'A Word out of the Sea,' to our thinking the poem of the book. A boy discovers a bird's-nest in some briars that skirt the sea-shore. Day after day he watches the movements of the male bird and his mate, listens to the singing and the chirping by which they express their happiness. At length,</p><p>May-be killed unknown to her mate,<br>One forenoon the she-bird crouched not on the nest,<br>Nor returned that afternoon, nor the next,<br>Nor ever returned again.</p><p>The boy continues to note the solitary bird flitting restlessly from spot to spot on the shore, and at times pouring forth a mournful song, the desolation, the longing and the brief beguiling hope of which the listener translates into human speech. To the boy's ear the bird sings as follows:\u2014</p><p>Soothe! soothe! soothe!<br>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,<br>And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every <br>one close,\u2014<br>But my love soothes not me, not me.</p><p>Low hangs the moon\u2014it rose late;<br>O it is lagging\u2014O I think it is heavy with love, with love.</p><p>O madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,<br>With love\u2014with love.</p><p>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among <br>the breakers?<br>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?</p><p>Loud! loud! loud!<br>Loud I call to you, my love!<br>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves;<br>Surely you must know who is here, is here;<br>You must know who I am, my love.</p><p>Low-hanging moon!<br>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?<br>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!<br>O moon, do not keep her from me any longer!</p><p>Land! land! O land!<br>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my <br>mate back again, if you only would;<br>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</p><p>O rising stars!<br>Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with <br>some of you.</p><p>O throat! O trembling throat!<br>Sound clearer through the atmosphere!<br>Pierce the woods, the earth;<br>Somewhere, listening to catch you, must be the one I want.</p><p>Shake out, carols!<br>Solitary here\u2014the night's carols!<br>Carols of lonesome love! Death's carols!<br>Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!<br>O, under that moon, where she droops almost down into<br> the sea!<br>O reckless, despairing carols!</p><p>But soft! sink low;<br>Soft! let me just murmur;<br>And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea;<br>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to<br> me,<br>So faint\u2014I must be still, be still to listen;<br>But not altogether still, for then she might not come <br>immediately to me.</p><p>Hither, my love!<br>Here I am! Here!<br>With this just-sustained note I announce myself to you;<br>This gentle call is for you, my love, for you!</p><p>Do not be decoyed elsewhere!<br>That is the whistle of the wind\u2014it is not my voice;<br>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;<br>Those are the shadows of leaves.</p><p>O darkness! O in vain!<br>O I am very sick and sorrowful!<br>O brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon <br>the sea!<br>O troubled reflection in the sea!<br>O throat! O throbbing heart!<br>O all!\u2014and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night!</p><p>Yet I murmur, murmur on!<br>O murmurs\u2014you yourselves make me continue to sing, I <br>know not why.</p><p>O past! O life! O songs of joy!<br>In the air\u2014in the woods\u2014over fields;<br>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!<br>But my love no more, no more with me!<br>We two together no more!</p><p>The plaint of the bird arouses in the boy, too, the sense of something missed and yearned for. A joy has vanished from the soul as its mate from the bird. Shall the ideal of youth that has taken wing return to earth no more? Shall the yearning for it ever be satisfied, and by what?\u2014</p><p>Answering, the Sea,<br>Delaying not, hurrying not,<br>Whispered me through the night and very plainly before<br> daybreak,<br>Lisped to me the low and delicious word DEATH.</p><p>Of the sublimated passion and sweetness of the above, of the minuteness with which the most delicate transitions of feeling are caught, and of the grand yet melancholy suggestiveness which sets the whole picture, as it were, in a frame of sad sunset glory, we can hardly speak in terms of praise too high. That Whitman can write noble poetry, this one example conclusively testifies.Of the writer, generally, it may be said, that he is universal in his sympathies, (with the sole exception that he cannot recognize the possibility of goodness in any man who happens to be born an aristocrat,)\u2014that (with this exception) he believes in the capacity for virtue, latent or developed, of all his fellows\u2014believes that the best man is but the full and perfected expression of the worth and power hidden in the worst,\u2014believes that in point of art it is right to express in speech all that is true in fact, and to regard all processes and things, natural or mechanical, that have once been associated with man as sanctified thereby. The 'homo sum' and the deductions drawn from it, have never found a more zealous advocate.</p><p>It is difficult to describe a mind so varied and yet so peculiar in a few phrases. Yet we will venture to designate Mr. Whitman as a wide, sincere, passionate thinker,\u2014presenting in himself a new combination of separate views, which are not particularly new in themselves. This is not said to his disadvantage, for truisms, after all, lie at the root of the world's progress. The expansiveness of his mind includes imagination, no doubt, but rather as a constituent than as a characteristic. He resembles those vast tracts of country in which is found the utmost diversity of surface, and in which long intervals of homely or even barren scenery precede and succeed glorious manifestations of Nature. He is so large and generic in his mode of thinking that he often scatters beauty in the seed rather than reveals it in the flowers; at other times, nothing can surpass the truthful minuteness with which he paints the most delicate nuances of feeling. He is a fine poet, though it would be a great error to say that all is poetry to which he has given the name.For a brief and excellent summary of Whitman's life and writings, we refer the reader to Mr. Rossetti's Preface\u2014a composition disfigured only by a somewhat puerile display of contempt for his fellow critics. His allegations against them may or may not be just; but their errors, if real, would have been more gracefully improved by that superior example which Mr. Rossetti so consciously affords, than by his unnecessary invectives.</p>", "date": "April 25 1868", "year": 1868, "creator": "John Marston", "publication": "The Athen\u00e6um", "citation": "Marston, John [unsigned in original]. \"[Review of Poems by Walt Whitman].\" 25 April 1868.

In part this opinion is already proved to have been a mistaken one, for a West-end publisher has taken compassion on the stranger, and now presents it to the British public in a comely form. It may be as well to state at the outset, that the volume published by Mr. Hotten is not precisely a reprint of the original Leaves of Grass. It contains much new matter written since the appearance of that work, and does not contain any of the pieces marked by that peculiar freedom of speech which is generally associated in men's minds with the name of Walt Whitman. For the sake of all parties, the prurient as well as the prudish, lest the one should be unnecessarily alarmed or the other led into an unremunerative venture, it is only fair to say that there is nothing in the present edition to disqualify it for decent society, not to say qualify it for a place in the Biblioth\u00e8que bleue. It has cost Mr. Rossetti severe pangs, so he informs us, to part with so much as, from considerations of prudence, he has been obliged to exclude. 'This peculiarly nervous age,' this 'mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century,' with its present absurd notions about decency, morality, and propriety, could not be expected to receive 'the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings' in that \u00e6sthetic spirit in which they should be accepted; and, as he was unwilling to mutilate, 'the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems, and some extremely fine ones\u2014notably one of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled Walt Whitman.' In one respect we are willing to admit the loss sustained in this last instance. The 'poem' here referred to is the one which contains the key to Walt Whitman's philosophy and poetic theory. It is in it that he describes himself and his qualifications for the office of poet of the future, grounding his claim upon the fact of his being 'hankering, gross, mystical, nude, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, no more modest than immodest'; and proposing to produce poetry of corresponding qualities, a promise which we must say he most conscientiously fulfils. Its excellence may be open to question, but about its value to the reader who wishes to understand Walt Whitman there can be no doubt whatever.</p><p>The present edition is to be considered as an experiment. By excluding everything offensive, the editor hopes to induce people to reconsider the case of Walt Whitman, and reverse the verdict which has been already pronounced. This, we need scarcely observe, is rather more than they can be fairly asked to do, while the evidence which supports the gravest of the charges brought against him is suppressed. But this is not all that Mr. Rossetti expects. The present selection is so to brace and fortify the British mind that in a short time, he trusts, it will be able to relish what now in its weakness it rejects. A complete edition of Walt Whitman, with all the dirt left in, he looks forward to as 'the right and crowning result' of his labours. This is but the schoolboy's pudding, which, if we only finish it off, is to be succeeded by a full meal of the uncommonly strong meat he has in reserve for us. A fellow-countryman of the poet's, who had unsuccessfully besieged the virtue of a married lady, is said to have consoled himself with the reflection that, at any rate, he had 'lowered her moral tone some.' Though he himself had not gained his point, his labours, he thought, had diminished the difficulties in the way of the next comer. Something of this sort appears to be the modest mission of the present volume. We must confess we should very much prefer to see Mr. Rossetti employing himself on some task more worthy of his abilities. He has on many occasions done good service as a critic to literature and art, but we cannot look upon his present enterprise as one in any way beneficial to either. He desires to have Walt Whitman recognised, not merely as a great poet, but as the founder of a new school of poetic literature which is to be greater and more powerful than any the world has yet seen. He is not, it is true, entirely alone in this attempt. There have been already certain indications of a Walt Whitman movement in one or two other quarters. More than a year ago there was a paper in the Fortnightly Review, which, however, was not so much a criticism of his poetry as of his person, the writer having had, as well as we recollect, the privilege of reviewing him as he bathed\u2014an important advantage, certainly, in the case of a poet whose principal theme is his own body. Then Mr. Robert Buchanan took him up in the Broadway magazine, and, saying nearly all that has ever been said against Walt Whitman\u2014that he is no poet and no artist, that he is gross, monotonous, loud, obscure, prone to coarse animalism and to talking rank nonsense\u2014nevertheless arrived at pretty much the same conclusion as Mr. Rossetti, at least as to the powerful influence he is to exercise over the literature of the future. Something of this sort we might, indeed, have expected. There are people whose reading of the Horatian saying about popular opinion is 'nunquam vulgus rectum videt,' and who always set themselves to find virtues in everything that is generally condemned. Besides, it would be idle to deny that Walt Whitman has many attractions for minds of a certain class. He is loud, swaggering, and self-assertive, and so gets credit for strength with those who worship nothing that is not strong. He is utterly lawless, and in consequence passes for being a great original genius. His produce is unlike anything else that has ever appeared in literature, and that is enough for those who are always on the look-out for novelty. He is rich in all those qualities of haziness, incoherence, and obscurity which seem to be the first that some readers nowadays look for in poetry. But, above all, he runs amuck with conventionalities and decencies of every sort, which naturally endears him to those silly people who take a childish delight in seeing the respectabilities of the world pulled by the nose, and what they consider its stupid prejudices shocked. We need scarcely say we do not suspect a man of Mr. Rossetti's taste and judgment of this kind of enthusiasm. If we were to hazard a theory, we should be inclined to attribute his advocacy of Walt Whitman's poetical claims to an impatience of the feebleness, emptiness, and sentimentality so abundant in modern poetry. The feeling is one with which we do not quarrel; we only object to the form in which it finds expression. A plague of tinkling cymbals is not to be met by a counter treatment of sounding brass.</p><p>An admirer of Walt Whitman has one immense advantage. There is no standard by which his idol can be measured, no known test which can be applied to prove his quality. There is, therefore, a wide field for that dogmatic assertion which is the favourite argument of the transcendental critic. You must not object that his poetry has no melody, music, or form. It is something above and beyond all requirements of that kind. You are not to raise the objection that in a great deal of what he writes there is no meaning at all, and in a great deal more the meaning, when got at, is utterly commonplace. Poetry like Walt Whitman's is not to be judged of by any one who is influenced by narrow considerations of meaning. You are not to take exception to his language, that it is a vile jargon of his own coining. A poet of this order naturally rises above the trammels of precedent in the matter of language. As to the absence of imagination, invention, fancy, art, and sundry other things more or less looked for in poetry, to complain of this in the present instance only shows that you are incapable of understanding the subject. This sort of argument always tells powerfully with the timid, with those people who are haunted by a nervous dread of being set down as dull and commonplace if they allow common sense to influence their judgment; and besides, it has the merit of being unanswerable, except by contradiction. When a man shows you something with all the outward and visible signs of a wheelbarrow, and tells you it is an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to know what to say to him; and it is just as hard to know what to say when you are offered something like the following and told it is poetry, and poetry of a very high order. As the admirers of Walt Whitman always protest against his being judged of fragmentarily, we take the shortest poem we can find, instead of giving the queerest extract:\u2014</p><p><em>VISAGES.</em><br>Of the visages of things\u2014And of piercing through to the accepted hells <br>beneath.<br>Of ugliness\u2014To me there is just as much in it as there is in beauty\u2014 <br>And now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.<br>Of detected persons\u2014To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, <br>worse than undetected persons\u2014and are not in any respect worse than <br>I am myself.<br>Of criminals\u2014To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal\u2014and <br>any reputable person is also\u2014and the President is also.</p><p>Now it may be that this is not balderdash, though we must confess to a strong suspicion that it is; but if it is poetry, all we can say is, we must find some other word for Shakespeare. Walt Whitman himself is much more candid on this point than his advocates. He certainly declares himself to be a poet, but at the same time he describes the offspring of his muse as a 'barbaric yawp.' We have no very definite idea as to the precise nature of a yawp, but, whatever it may be, it can scarcely be poetry.</p><p>We must do Mr. Rossetti the justice of admitting that he does not entirely rely on dogmatism in pleading the cause of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He does assign some few reasons why Walt Whitman should be accepted as 'the poet of the epoch.' In a paper which appeared in a weekly journal, he puts the claim on the rather curious ground of his being 'an initiator in the scheme and structure of his writings, and an individual of audacious personal ascendant.' But in the preface to the present volume he comes more plainly to the point. The reader, he says, is not to ask himself, or return any answer to the questions, whether or not Walt Whitman is like other poets, or whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of other poets, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in his work. 'Let the questions rather be\u2014Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel, and make me feel?' To each of these questions we should be disposed to answer simply 'No,' were it not that an unqualified negative is scarcely polite. We can see no reason for considering Walt Whitman powerful. Strong he may be, but it is only in the sense in which an onion is strong. His noise, bluster, and arrogance are no more indications of true strength than the swagger of the professional athlete at a country fair, who struts up and down the stage in salmon-coloured tights, and passes for a Hercules with the crowd from the way in which he feels his muscles in public. That he is American in one sense we must admit. He is something which no other country could have produced. He is American as certain forms of rowdyism and vulgarity, excrescences on American institutions, are American. But that he is American in the sense of being representative of American taste, intellect, or cultivation, we should be very sorry indeed to believe. New he certainly is, but it is only in his audacity, and in the abnormal structure of his poetry; there is not a new thought in his writings from beginning to end. As to the other questions, the answer must depend very much on individual temperament. Whether or not he himself feels we cannot tell, but, so far from being rousing or making his reader feel, we should say that with ninety-nine out of a hundred average readers Walt Whitman, taken in any quantity, would be found to be about as soporific a poet as ever produced a yawn. But even if all these questions could be answered in the affirmative\u2014even if we were to concede that Walt Whitman is powerful and new and American and rousing, and throw into the bargain what his friends invariably lay great stress upon, his magnificent physique and his irreproachable character in private life\u2014still all this, we submit, does not make him out to be a poet. To call a man a poet merely because he holds forth in rhapsodical style about one man being as good as another, everything being all right, every one having a right 'to do as he dam pleases'\u2014if we may venture to quote the concise language of Transatlantic liberty\u2014and other dogmas of the same sort, is to confuse the functions of the poet and the stump orator; and generally, when Walt Whitman has any meaning at all, it amounts to no more than this. Very often he has no meaning whatever. In his fury he breaks out into a mere perspiration of words, and strings substantives together for pages on a stretch, the result being a something which is as much like poetry as an auctioneer's catalogue. To be sure there is scattered through his pages a vast amount of that vagueness which to some tastes has the true poetic charm. No doubt there are people who consider this sort of thing very fine:</p><p><em>OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</em><br>The skies of day and night\u2014colours, densities, forms\u2014May-be these are <br>(as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has <br>yet to be known;</p><p>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) <br>as from my present point of view\u2014And might prove (as of course <br>they would) naught of what they appear, or naught any how, from <br>entirely changed points of view.</p><p>But if it is very fine, then so is Miss Codger's outburst on being introduced to Elijah Pogram:\u2014</p><p>But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle, to which we give those titles, is a topic, spirit-searching, light-abandoned, much too vast to enter on.</p><p>But of course the special charm of Walt Whitman is that he is so\u2014what his admirers call unconventional; that is, that he says things which other people do not say, and in language which other people do not generally use. His unconventionality, however, is of a very cheap sort. It is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them. It is true that for the present we are spared the bolder strokes of his genius in this respect, but, as has been already mentioned, it is only for the present; and besides, Walt Whitman's grossness is not accidental, but constitutional. It arises partly from an insensibility to the difference between that which is naturally offensive and that which is not, partly from his peculiar theory of poetry. As it is a fundamental principle of his to recognise no law of any kind, and to submit to no restrictions of artistic propriety, it follows that with him all subjects are equally fit for poetic treatment. As Mr. Rossetti puts it, 'he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech,' and it is just this ignorance of his which, independently of other reasons, makes any attempt to set him up as a poetic model mischievous to the interests of literary art. It is not a question of squeamishness or hyper sensitiveness. There is no prudery in objecting to nastiness, nor is there any originality, honesty, manliness, or courage in obtruding what even instinct teaches us to avoid. We cannot say, however, that we anticipate any serious injury to English or American literature from the influence or popularity of Walt Whitman's poetry, so long at least as people are courageous enough to use their common sense, and do not allow themselves to be led away by transcendental 'high-falutin' into pretending an admiration which they do not feel.</p><p>\u2217 Poems by Walt Whitman.

The poem of the book is considered to be 'A Word out of the Sea,' which 'conclusively testifies that Whitman can write noble poetry.' This, however, is a verdict, not upon the whole writings of Mr. Whitman, but upon so many of them as his editor, Mr. W. M. Rossetti, has thought it prudent to put into English print. No publisher could be found\u2014not even Mr. Swinburne's\u2014willing to affront both the law and public sense of decency by an unexpurgated issue of writings which owe their toleration in America to their obscurity. In private, Mr. Whitman has been more or less a topic of discussion. I have never yet heard, from any competent source, a favorable opinion on his claims. I have heard but one such opinion from any English source whatever, and that was from a poet whose critical judgment may have yielded to his sympathy with the worst eccentricities of Whitman's muse. But there is plenty of stern criticism from men who are usually tolerant, and of contemptuous criticism from men who are usually merciful. Mr. Carlyle likens him to a buffalo, useful in fertilizing the soil, but mistaken in supposing that his contributions of that sort are matters which the world desires to contemplate closely.'</p>", "date": "May 167 1868", "year": 1868, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "National Anti-Slavery Standard", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"[Review of Poems by Walt Whitman].\" 16 May 1868.

The unreasonable laudation (now so common) makes us as unreasonably despise its object. 'As it is impossible to conceive a world without a Shakespeare, so we cannot picture it to ourselves without this new sweet singer, Jones.' Bother Jones! We that have known Keats and Shelley, and Byron, and Wordsworth and Coleridge, to be told that there has been no such poet as Jones!</p><p>Not a little ludicrous eulogy of this sort has been poured of late upon the American poet whose name stands at the head of this paper, but he is really noteworthy nevertheless. He is the first characteristic poetical writer that the United States have produced. Longfellow is but Tennyson and water; and as for the other Transatlantic bards, they have produced solitary poems of great merit, but none which might not have been written by an Englishman of genius, who had paid great attention to the panoramas of the Mississippi or of the Prairies which have been unfolded from time to time in Leicester Square. Whitman's very faults are national. The brag, and bluster, and self-assertion of the man are American only; the fulsome 'cracking-up' of his own nation is such as would not be ventured upon by a British bard; the frequent bathos\u2014the use of newspaper terms and of terms which have no existence out of New York, and in which you almost hear the American nasal twang, are all characteristic. He is Yankee to the backbone; Yankee, also, it must however be added, in his outspoken independence of thought, in his audacious originality, in his perfect freedom from conventional twaddle, and in his contempt for accidental rank of all sorts. He has named half his volume Chants Democratic, and though they are not chants, nor anything like it, they are certainly democratic. He does not write verse at all, which is fortunate, for he would certainly not be particular about his rhymes; nor does he even write blank verse; but he has invented a certain rolling changeful metre of his own, with, as his English editor\u2217 truly remarks, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense throughout.' He sometimes furnishes long strings of detached items\u2014very like the list of goods furnished by shops to their customers; but they are 'not devoid of a certain primitive effectiveness' by any means.</p><p>The doctrine of nihil humanum, &c. was never pushed to such extreme limits as by Walt Whitman. If a man could gain the suffrages of the human race by flattering them with the sense of their tremendous importance, this poet would be king of the world.</p><p>Small is the theme of the following chant, yet the <br>greatest\u2014namely, ONE'S-SELF; that wondrous <br>thing, a simple separate person. That, for the <br>use of the New World, I sing.<br>Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. <br>Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is <br>worthy for the Muse: I say the form complete <br>is worthier far. The female equally with the <br>male I sing.<br>Nor cease at the theme of One's-self. I speak the <br>word of the modern, the word En Masse.</p><p>Such is Mr Whitman's programme. If he did not speak 'the word of the modern' quite so often, or, at least, not borrow it from the penny-a-liner, it would be better for his fame. Also, through singing 'Man's physiology complete,' he has caused Mr Rossetti to be at the trouble of preparing the present 'Bowdlerised,' or excised edition of his works, to suit the squeamish tastes of the Old Country. So please, ladies, be particular to ask for the above-mentioned edition. There is nothing in that which you may not read, or the book would not be noticed in these columns.</p><p>Whitman's poetry reminds us, as we have said, of no other poet, but in his prose we seem to recognise some kinship to Emerson's. Here is a fine passage from the preface to his Leaves of Grass [the titles of his poems are unattractive, being almost always affected or unmeaning], insisting upon the importance of human act, word, thought, and the indestructibility of their results.</p><p>All that a person does or thinks is of consequence. Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in a day or a month, or any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death, but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime. The indirect is always as great and real as the direct. The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body. Not one name of word or deed \u2026not of the putrid veins of gluttons or rum-drinkers \u2026not peculation, or cunning, or betrayal, or murder \u2026no serpentine poison of those that seduce women \u2026not the foolish yielding of women \u2026not of the attainment of gain by discreditable means \u2026not any nastiness of appetite \u2026not any harshness of officers to men, or judges to prisoners, or fathers to sons, or sons to fathers, or of husbands to wives, or bosses to their boys \u2026not of greedy looks or malignant wishes \u2026nor any of the wiles practised by people upon themselves \u2026ever is or ever can be stamped on the programme, but it is duly realised and returned, and that returned in further performances, and they returned again. Nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason, whether it bring arguments to hand or no. No specification is necessary \u2026to add, or subtract, or divide is in vain. Little or big, learned or unlearned, white or black, legal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or female does that is vigorous, and benevolent, and clean, is so much sure profit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the whole scope of it for ever. If the savage or felon is wise, it is well \u2026if the greatest poet or savant is wise, it is simply the same \u2026if the President or chief-justice is wise, it is the same \u2026if the young mechanic or farmer is wise, it is no more or less. The interest will come round \u2026all will come round. All the best actions of war and peace \u2026all help given to relatives and strangers, and the poor, and old, and sorrowful, and young children, and widows, and the sick, and to all shunned persons \u2026all furtherance of fugitives and of the escape of slaves \u2026all the self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others take the seats of the boats \u2026all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend's sake or opinion's sake \u2026all pains of enthusiasts scoffed at by their neighbours \u2026all the vast sweet love and precious suffering of mothers \u2026all honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded \u2026all the grandeur and good of the few ancient nations whose fragments of annals we inherit \u2026and all the good of the hundreds of far mightier and more ancient nations unknown to us by name or date or location \u2026all that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or not \u2026all that has at any time been well suggested out of the divine heart of man, or by the divinity of his mouth, or by the shaping of his great hands \u2026and all that is well thought or done this day on any part of the surface of the globe, or on any of the wandering stars or fixed stars by those there as we are here \u2026or that is henceforth to be well thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any one\u2014these singly and wholly inured at their time, and inure now, and will inure always, to the identities from which they sprung or shall spring.</p><p>A fine lay-sermon, surely.</p><p>From common humanity our author rises to the American Citizen, with a portrait of whom he furnishes us, which will not easily be recognised by those who have only been accustomed to see English photographs of the individual in question. Other states, he says, indicate themselves by their deputies, but the United States always most in its common people.</p><p>Their manners, speech, dress, friendships\u2014the freshness and candour of their physiognomy\u2014the picturesque looseness of their carriage\u2014their deathless attachment to freedom\u2014their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft, or mean\u2014the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states\u2014the fierceness of their roused resentment\u2014their curiosity and welcome of novelty\u2014their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy\u2014their susceptibility to a slight\u2014the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors\u2014the fluency of their speech\u2014their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul\u2014their good temper and open-handedness\u2014the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him\u2014these, too, are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</p><p>In the meantime, however, Walt Whitman will try his hand.</p><p>Starting from fish-shape Paumanok,\u2020 where I was <br>born,<br>Well-begotten, and raised by a perfect mother;<br>After roaming many lands\u2014lover of populous <br>pavements;<br>Dweller in Mannahatta\u2021, city of ships, my city\u2014 <br>or on southern savannas;<br>Or a soldier camped, or carrying my knapsack and <br>gun\u2014or a miner in California;<br>Or rude in my home in Dakotah's woods, my diet <br>meat, my drink from the spring;<br>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep <br>recess,<br>Far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, <br>rapt and happy;<br>Aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing Missouri <br>\u2014aware of mighty Niagara;<br>Aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains\u2014the <br>hirsute and strong-breasted bull;<br>Of earths, rocks, fifth-month flowers, experienced\u2014 <br>stars, rain, snow, my amaze;<br>Having studied the mocking-bird's tones, and the <br>mountain hawk's,<br>And heard at dusk the unrivalled one, the hermit <br>thrush, from the swamp-cedars,<br>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New <br>World.</p><p>He even dates from the United States era; in 1856, he writes:</p><p>In the Year 80 of the States,<br>My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from<br> this soil, this air,<br>Born here of parents born here, from parents the <br>same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-six years old, in perfect health begin,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.<br>Creeds and schools in abeyance<br>(Retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are,<br> but never forgotten),<br>I harbour, for good or bad\u2014I permit to speak, at<br> every hazard\u2014<br>Nature now without check, with original energy.</p><p>Yet he is so good as to say that former experience and instruction have not been altogether thrown away; he is grateful, only let it be distinctly understood, that he is under no slavish sense of obligation; that the gratitude must be reciprocal.</p><p>I conned old times;<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might <br>return and study me!</p><p>If eligible? One would think he pictured himself as an investment. You must not be put off your liking, reader, by these blots. 'Whitman is a poet who bears and needs to be read as a whole, and then the volume and torrent of his power carry the disfigurements along with it and away.' He is really a fine fellow.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophs, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or<br> desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what <br>you have left, wafted hither:<br>I have perused it\u2014own it is admirable (moving <br>a while among it);<br>Think nothing can ever be greater\u2014nothing can <br>ever deserve more than it deserves;<br>Regarding it all intently a long while, then<br> dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.</p><p>It is as the poet of his own day, of his own nation (as also of Humanity, though in a less degree), that Whitman is to be considered. Half a century ago, he would have been wholly unintelligible; and half a century hence, it is possible that he will be forgotten; but he will leave much seed behind him, and perhaps found a school whose pupils will be greater than their master. His messages to the Poor and Fallen (who will most certainly never receive them, by the by) are full of tenderness and fraternal love, but never of pity: why should they be pitied, who are as high as the highest, and as good as the best? Nay, even crime does not cut them off from their equality with him, or him from his sympathy with them.</p><p>If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become <br>so for your sake;<br>If you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, <br>do you think I cannot remember my own <br>foolish and outlawed deeds?<br>If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite<br> side of the table;<br>If you meet some stranger in the streets, and love <br>him or her\u2014why, I often meet strangers in the <br>street, and love them.</p><p>Why, what have you thought of yourself?<br>Is it you then that thought yourself less?<br>Is it you that thought the President greater than you?<br>Or the rich better off than you? or the educated <br>wiser than you?<br>Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you <br>was once drunk, or a thief,<br>Or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so <br>now;<br>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no <br>scholar, and never saw your name in print,<br>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?</p><p>Whitman does not pretend to read 'the riddle of the painful earth;' but he takes leave to admire, after his fashion, the great Cosmos;</p><p>The sun and stars that float in the open air;<br>The apple-shaped earth, and we upon it\u2014surely the<br> drift of them is something grand!<br>I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, <br>and that it is happiness,<br>And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a<br> speculation, or bon-mot, or reconnaissance,<br>And that it is not something which by luck may <br>turn out well for us, and without luck must be <br>a failure for us,<br>And not something which may yet be retracted in <br>a certain contingency.</p><p>Yet it is Man, and not external Nature, which has his worship:</p><p>When the psalm sings instead of the singer;<br>When the script preaches instead of the preacher;<br>When the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the <br>carver that carved the supporting desk;<br>When I can touch the body of books, by night or <br>by day, and when they touch my body back <br>again;<br>When a university course convinces, like a slumber-<br>ing woman and child convince;<br>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the <br>night-watchman's daughter;<br>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and <br>are my friendly companions;<br>I intend to reach them my hand, and make as <br>much of them as I do of men and women like <br>you.</p><p>The sum of all known reverence I add up in you, <br>whoever you are;<br>The President is there in the White House for you\u2014 <br>it is not you who are here for him.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>List close, my scholars dear!<br>All doctrines, all politics and civilisation, exsurge <br>from you;<br>All sculpture and monuments, and anything in-<br>scribed anywhere, are tallied in you;<br>The gist of histories and statistics, as far back as<br> the records reach, is in you this hour, and <br>myths and tales the same;<br>If you were not breathing and walking here, where <br>would they all be?<br>The most renowned poems would be ashes, orations <br>and plays would be vacuums.</p><p>Whitman is practical beyond all poets before him; and, indeed, in one sense (but not in the anti-theological one), material. It delights him to contemplate the visible instruments of labour, and he sings, in minutest detail, the works which they accomplish. The axe leaps, and the solid forest, says he, gives blind utterances, and the manifold shapes arise in his mind's eye, which are hewn out of the wood.</p><p>The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his <br>shroud;<br>The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts,<br> in the posts of the bride's bed;<br>The shape of the little trough, the shape of the <br>rockers beneath, the shape of the babe's cradle;<br>The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for <br>dancers' feet;<br>The shape of the planks of the family home, the <br>home of the friendly parents and children,<br>The shape of the roof of the home of the happy<br> young man and woman, the roof over the well- <br>married young man and woman,<br>The roof over the supper joyously cooked by the <br>chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the chaste <br>husband, content after his day's work.</p><p>The shapes arise!<br>The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-room, <br>and of him or her seated in the place;<br>The shape of the liquor-bar leaned against by the <br>young rum-drinker and the old rum-drinker;<br>The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by <br>sneaking footsteps;</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish <br>winnings and losings;<br>The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and <br>sentenced murderer, the murderer with haggard <br>face and pinioned arms.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances;<br>The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed and <br>in haste;<br>The door that admits good news and bad news;<br>The door whence the son left home, confident and <br>puffed up;<br>The door he entered again from a long and scandal- <br>ous absence, diseased, broken down, without <br>innocence, without means.</p><p>These picturings may be somewhat weird and fanciful, but they are expressed with power, and the conception of them is certainly original and striking. They are, however, too prolonged, and remind one of what somebody writes of the minuteness of Crabbe's verse\u2014that he was like a broker appraising furniture.</p><p>Under the unsatisfactory title of 'Assimilations,' Whitman describes the influence of association upon the human mind, and, incidentally, depicts most graphically the surroundings and circumstances of the somewhat unenviable home in which he himself was reared.</p><p>The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on <br>the supper-table;<br>The mother with mild words\u2014clean her cap and <br>gown, a wholesome odour falling off her person <br>and clothes as she walks by;<br><em>The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust;<br>The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the <br>crafty lure,</em><br>The family usages, the language, the company, the <br>furniture\u2014the yearning and swelling heart,<br>Affection that will not be gainsayed\u2014the sense of <br> what is real\u2014the thought if after all it should <br>prove unreal,<br>The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time <br>\u2014the curious whether and how,<br>Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all<br> flashes and specks?<br>Men and women crowding fast in the streets\u2014if <br>they are not flashes and specks, what are they?<br>The streets themselves, and the fa\u00e7ades of houses, <br>and goods in the windows,<br>Vehicles, teams, the heavy-planked wharfs\u2014the <br>huge crossing at the ferries,<br>The village on the highland, seen from afar at <br>sunset\u2014the river between,<br>Shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs <br>and gables of white or brown, three miles off,<br>The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the <br>tide\u2014the little boat slack-towed astern,<br>The hurrying tumbling waves quick-broken crests <br>slapping,<br>The strata of coloured clouds, the long bar of <br>maroon-tint, away solitary by itself\u2014the spread <br>of purity it lies motionless in,<br>The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fra-<br>grance of salt-marsh and shore-mud:<br>These became part of that child who went forth<br> every day, and who now goes, and will always <br>go forth every day.</p><p>In Mr Rossetti's Preface, we learn in plain prose what Walt Whitman's life has been. Walt, it appears, is merely a characteristic appellation; he was named Walter, like his father before him, who was first a farmer, afterwards a carpenter and builder (hence, doubtless, that eulogy on the axe), and an adherent to the religious principles of 'the great Quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks,' of whom, if our readers have never heard, they are no worse off than we are.</p><p>Walt\u2014born in 1819\u2014was schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and began life at the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on, as a country teacher, and then as a miscellaneous press-writer in New York.' He changed his pursuits, after the national fashion: became newspaper editor, and then builder, like his father; from 1837 to 1848, was, we fear, a rowdy, since his American biographer informs us that, during that period, 'he sounded all experiences of life, with all their passions, pleasures, and abandonments;' but in 1862, on the breaking out of the Civil War, he undertook the (gratuitous) service of nursing the wounded. He was a Northerner, of course, but the Southern sick were tended by him with equal care; 'the strongest testimony is borne to his self-devotion and kindliness;' and in a Washington hospital, when attending upon a case of gangrene, he absorbed the poison into his system, and was disabled for six months. In 1865, he obtained a clerkship in the Department of the Interior; but this was taken from him when he published his audacious Leaves of Grass. 'He soon after, however, obtained another modest, but creditable post in the office of the Attorney-general. He still visits the hospitals on Sundays, and often on other days as well.</p><p>The poet is 'much above the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned\u2026. He has light-blue eyes, a florid complexion, a fleecy beard, now gray, and a quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in contact\u2026. He has always been carried by predilection towards the society of the common people; but is not the less for that open to refined and artistic impressions.' As 'an accessible human individual,' he is thus described by a writer in theFortnightly Review: 'Having occasion to visit New York soon after the appearance of Walt Whitman's book, I was urged by some friends to search him out\u2026. The day was excessively hot, the thermometer at nearly 100 , and the sun blazed down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze\u2026. I saw stretched upon his back, and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was seeking. With his gray clothing, his blue-gray shirt, his iron-gray hair, his swart sunburned face and bare neck, he lay upon the brown-and-white grass\u2014for the sun had burned away its greenness\u2014and was so like the earth upon which he rested that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to pass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name and reason for searching him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot. 'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then walked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room. A small room of about fifteen feet square, with a single window looking out on the barren solitudes of the island; a small cot; a washstand, with a little looking-glass hung over it from a tack in the wall; a pine-table, with pen, ink, and paper on it; an old line-engraving, representing Bacchus, hung on the wall\u2014and opposite, a similar one of Silenus: these constituted the visible environments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a single book in the room\u2026. The books he seemed to know and love best were the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in his pockets while we were talking. He had two studies where he read: one was the top of an omnibus; and the other a small mass of sand, then entirely uninhabited, far out in the ocean, called Coney Island\u2026. The only distinguished contemporary he had ever met was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn, who had visited him\u2026. He confessed to having no talent for industry, and that his forte was 'loafing and writing poems:' he was poor, but had discovered that he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread and water\u2026. On no occasion did he laugh, nor indeed did I ever see him smile.'</p><p>If he does not laugh, he is humorous enough in his poems, although, it may be, without being aware of it. Under the head of Wonders\u2014and if he has the bump of Wonder, I am afraid he has not that of Veneration\u2014he thus discourses:</p><p>The great laws take and effuse without argument;<br>I am of the same style, for I am their friend,<br>I love them quits and quits\u2014I do not halt and <br>make salaams.<br>I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, <br>and the reasons of things;<br><em>They are so beautiful, I nudge myself to listen.</em><br>I cannot say to any person what I hear\u2014I cannot <br>say it to myself\u2014it is very wonderful.</p><P>The notion of nudging one's self to listen is capital, but suggests that there may be a tinge of Irish-American in Mr Walt Whitman's otherwise pur sang (as he would term it). Here is something which, while reminding one in its form of Mr Martin Tupper, would, if the idea should be attributed to him, give that respectable gentleman a fit:</p><p>Of detected persons\u2014To me, detected persons are <br>not in any respect worse than undetected per-<br>sons\u2014and are not in any respect worse than <br>I am myself.<br>Of criminals\u2014To me, any judge, or any juror, is <br>equally criminal\u2014and any reputable person also\u2014 <br>and the President is also.</p><p>We cannot more fitly conclude our notice of this really remarkable man than by quoting his most characteristic poem. It is from the Leaves of Grass, and is called Burial. It expresses very strikingly in his strange rhythm the thought that has struck most of us who have any egotism. How strange that the world should have wagged on for ages before we came into it, and how still stranger (and more audacious) that it will still continue to wag on, when we have ceased to wag.</p><p>To think of it!<br>To think of time\u2014of all that retrospection!<br>To think of to-day, and the ages continued hence- <br>forward!</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>To think that the sun rose in the east! that men <br>and women were flexible, real, alive! that <br>everything was alive!<br>To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, <br>nor bear our part!<br>To think that we are now here, and bear our part!<br>Not a day passes\u2014not a minute or second, without <br>an accouchement!<br>Not a day passes\u2014not a minute or second, without <br>a corpse!<br>The dull nights go over, and the dull days also;<br>The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over;<br>The physician, after long putting off, gives the <br>silent and terrible lookfor an answer;<br>The children come hurried and weeping, and the <br>brothers and sisters are sent for;<br>Medicines stand unused on the shelf (the camphor- <br>smell has long pervaded the rooms);<br>The faithful hand of the living does not desert the <br>hand of the dying;<br>The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of <br>the dying;<br>The breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases;<br>The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it;<br>It is palpable as the living are palpable.</p><p>The living look upon the corpse with their eye- <br>sight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living, and <br>looks curiously on the corpse.<br>To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow <br>fall, and the fruits ripen, and act upon others <br>as upon us now\u2014yet not act upon us!<br>To think of all these wonders of city and country, <br>and others taking great interest in them\u2014and <br>we taking no interest in them!<br>To think how eager we are in building our houses! <br>To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite <br>indifferent!</p><p>The poet considers the universalness of this thing called Death</p><p>Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole <br>earth\u2026they never cease\u2026they are the burial- <br>lines;<br>He that was President was buried, and he that is <br>now President shall surely be buried.</p><p>But the particular illustration which Walt Whitman characteristically selects of Burial is by no means that of the President, but of an old Broadway stage-driver. It is so graphic, that it might be a sketch by Dickens, and yet it has a weird sort of rhythm about it that separates it from prose of any sort:</p><p>Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf\u2014posh and <br>ice in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets, a <br>gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last <br>day-light of Twelfth-month;<br>A hearse and stages\u2014other vehicles give place\u2014 <br>the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, <br>the cort\u00e8ge mostly drivers.</p><p>Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the <br>death-bell, the gate is passed, the new-dug <br>grave is halted at, the living alight, the hearse <br>uncloses,<br>The coffin is passed out, lowered and settled, the <br>whip is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly <br>shovelled in,<br>The mound above is flatted with the spades\u2014silence;<br>A minute, no one moves or speaks\u2014it is done;<br>He is decently put away\u2014is there anything more?</p><p>He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tem- <br>pered, not bad-looking, able to take his own <br>part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with <br>life or death for a friend, fond of women, <br>gambled, ate hearty, drank hearty, had known<br> what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited <br>toward the last, sickened, was helped by a <br>contribution, died, aged forty-one years\u2014and <br>that was his funeral.<br>Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, <br>strap, wet-weather clothes, whip carefully <br>chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody<br> loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, head-<br>way, man before and man behind, good day's <br>work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, <br>first out, last out, turning-in at night;<br>To think that these are so much and so nigh to <br>other drivers\u2014and he there takes no interest <br>in them!</p><p>\u2217 Poems by Walt Whitman.

The Kosmos hailed from America, and was introduced to the reader in a frontispiece which represented an unkempt, dishevelled person in long hair and impossible eyes, crowned with a wide-awake hat. This picturesque ruffian announced himself as 'of the Manahatta, singing thereof, and no less in myself than the whole of Manahatta in itself.' In order to make himself and his mission still clearer to the minds of men, he thus spoke in his preface:\u2014</p><p>'This is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown, or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the young, and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school, or church, or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem, and have the richest fluency, not only in its words, but in the silent lines of its lips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and in every motion and joint of your body.'</p><p>Unimpressed by these warnings, the critics scoffed at Leaves of Grass. They could not discover that the Kosmos wrote either poetry or sense. They could perceive that he was obscene, filthy, and blasphemous\u2014that he knew his filth and revelled in it\u2014calling upon us to admire in him that which was most nasty\u2014shouting and gibbering like an ill-conditioned chimpanzee. What small gleams of meaning there lay in these simious utterances was the veriest commonplace, the baldest platitude. In fact, the critics declared that this new poet from beyond the seas was but a wild and inflated Tupper, that he was nebulous only because he had no meaning, that even when most distinct he was incoherent, and that altogether it was a very foolish and dull sort of monster.</p><p>Mr. W. M. Rosetti calls upon us now with much gravity to reverse all these judgments. Walt Whitman, we are told, is not a man to be overlooked. Walt Whitman is a true seer, a most subtle and profound poet. Rough he may be, but he is the child of Nature. Wild he may be, but he is the Spirit of the Young World. In Walt Whitman we are called upon to recognise 'the founder of American poetry rightly to be so called, and the most sonorous poetic voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy.' Before Walt Whitman we are called upon to bow, as the genius of the Future, the expounder of the To Be. As for Mr. Rosetti, who, in other respects, is a sensible and decent man, and a delicate and acute critic; he is overwhlemed with the contemplation of this huge, blurred figure of a Titan which rises out of chaos. He prostrates himself before the uncouth image of Whitman, just as a Hindoo grovels before Siva. In the writings of Walt Whitman Mr. Rosetti discovers 'a waif of prose amid the weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare himself furnishes the precedent for in drama.' Evidently Mr. Rosetti is only restrained by a feeling of delicacy towards public opinion from pronouncing Whitman a much greater man than Shakespeare. 'The entire book' (Leaves of Grass) he declares to be 'the poem of the natural man, not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively intellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and foremost, is therein also a spirit and an intellect.' Certainly, nothing like this could be said of poor William Shakespeare. He was but a small creature, and never wrote anything like 'a poem of the natural man.' Of the disjunctively intellectual, it is probable that an English bard had but the dimmest notion. He was all very well for his time, but he was not a Kosmos. It is probable that he never thought of a 'mission' at all, and we are very sure that he received no hint in his soul of 'the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy.'</p><p>By way of showing us what a superior animal is this American poet, Mr. Rosetti has given us a selection of his works, with which he has taken what we must consider the unwarrantable liberty of cutting out all the blasphemies and obscenities. Surely this is but scurvy treatment for the poet of the Future. Surely the p\u00e6an of the natural man' ought to be given to us entire, as the prophet himself delivered it. What right has Mr. Rosetti to blurt and spoil the great message which is intended for our salvation? The excuse that an editor gives for leaving out about one-half of what Walt Whitman really wrote, and for dressing up the remainder with headings and cutting it into arbitrary lengths, we must hold to be very insufficient. Mr. Rosetti tells us that he has omitted 'every poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age'\u2014which is but a clumsy way of serving either the poet or the age. Surely a Kosmos knows better than Mr. Rosetti what is best for the age. The p\u00e6an of the natural man, to be of any value, should be given in the singer's own words. How are we to judge of whole man Whitman if we are to see only the most decent part of him? Those who are acquainted with Leaves of Grass in their original form know that it is this very indecency and bold out-speaking upon which Walt Whitman prides himself\u2014which are his claims to the Kosmical distinction. We presume it is not by school-girls that Whitman's place in literature is to be fixed. Why then this foolish and insulting squeamishness?</p><p>How the purged and shaved Whitman looks under Mr. Rosetti's hands we can best show by specimens of his poetry. Here is one passage, which we are led to believe is a favourable sample of our poet's quality, which may be supposed to be valuable as explaining the 'tangibilities of the prospective democracy':\u2014</p><p>'Democracy!<br>Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.<br>Ma femme!<br>For the brood beyond us and of us,<br>For those who belong here, and those to come,<br>I, exultant, to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon the earth,<br>I will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,<br>And your songs, outlawed offenders\u2014for I scan you with kindred eyes, and carry you with me the same as any.<br>I will make the true poem of riches,\u2014<br>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and is not dropped by death.<br>I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all\u2014and I will be the bard of personality;<br>And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other;<br>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present\u2014and can be none in the future;<br>And I will show that, whatever happens to anybody, it may be turned to beautiful results\u2014and I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death;<br>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact,<br>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound as any.<br>I will not make poems with reference to parts;<br>But I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts, with reference to ensemble;<br>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days;<br>And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference to the soul;<br>Because, having looked at the objects of the universe, I hold there is no one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the soul.'</p><p>To those who may still hold that the tangibilities of democracy are a little hazy we can give no consolation. If they will not believe Mr. Rosetti they will not believe Walt Whitman, who sent him. The poetry of the future may be considered to be slightly wanting both in rhythm and reason; but those who make this objection are vulgar persons to whom the vision has never come. They are only to be pitied and passed by\u2014according to Mr. Rosetti. To the enlightened few it will be only necessary to quote such a passage as this, and all is clear:\u2014</p><p><em>'WHEREFORE?</em><br>O me! O life! . . . of the questions of those recurring;<br>Of the endless trains of the faithless\u2014of cities filled with the foolish;<br>Of myself for ever reproaching myself (for who more foolish than I and who more faithless?);<br>Of eyes that vainly crave the light\u2014of the objects mean\u2014of the struggle ever renewed;<br>Of the poor results of all\u2014of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me;<br>Of the empty and useless years of the rest\u2014with the rest me intertwined;<br>The question, O me! so sad, recurring,\u2014What good amid these, O me, O life?'</p><p><em>'ANSWER.</em><br>'That you are here\u2014that life exists, and identity;<br>That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.'<br>And part of another poem is as follows:\u2014<br>'The workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth;<br>The great masters know the earth's words, and use them more than the audible words,<br>Amelioration is one of the earth's words;<br>The earth neither lags nor hastens;<br>It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump;<br>It is not half beautiful only\u2014defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show,<br>The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough;<br>The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so concealed either;<br>They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;<br>They are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,<br>Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth. I utter and utter:<br>I speak not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail am I to you?<br>To bear\u2014to better; lacking these, of what avail am I?<br>Accouche! Accouchez!<br>Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?<br>Will you squat and stifle there?<br>The earth does not argue,<br>Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,<br>Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,<br>Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,<br>Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,<br>Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.<br>The earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itself\u2014posesses still underneath;<br>Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves,<br>Persuasions of lovers, curses, gaps of the dying, laughter of young people, accents of bargainers,<br>Underneath these, possessing the words that never fail.<br>To her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail;<br>The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does not fail;<br>Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail.'</p><p>According to one of Walt Whitman's admirers, this is one of those portions of the work by which we perceive that 'life is everything, that man is an integral part of the world's life, and that it is by the full unfolding of man's powers that life is ennobled and the world made beautiful.' After this, may we not put in a claim for our own Tupper? Has he not written to show that 'life is everything,' and that 'man is an integral part of the world's life?' What is the burden of our latter-day Solomon, if not that it is by the full unfolding of a man's powers that life is to be ennobled? It is true that our Tupper does not violate the decencies, nor call himself a Kosmos. But surely it is but a dissolute and an inebriate Tupper who writes most of the lines which Mr. Rosetti so admires. What shall we say to this, for instance:\u2014</p><p>'All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;<br>Did you think it was in the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches and cornices?<br>All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments.'</p><p>Or in a higher key and in the most prophetic manner this, which really contains the only gem of a poetic idea which to our common understandings is perceptible in Walt Whitman:\u2014</p><p>'What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the seas?<br>Are all nations communing? Is there going to be but one heart to the globe?<br>Is humanity forming en masse?\u2014for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;<br>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war;<br>No one knows what will happen next\u2014such portents fill the days and nights;<br>Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full of phantoms;<br>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;<br>This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams, O years!<br>Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I sleep or wake!)<br>The performed American and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me;<br>The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.'</p><p>We are entreated to give this kind of thing a patient hearing, and are asked to recognise it as at least a real voice arising out of the motion of the universe. It may be that Walt Whitman is a true poet and that to him is given the key which is to unlock the secret of the future. If so, we can only say that the world has been all wrong as to what constitutes poetry. If Walt Whitman is a poet, then we have greatly to enlarge the circle of Parnassus, and to make easy the way to the summit. If to discharge one's imagination of all the crude shapes which gather there be to write poetry, then there are some thousands who have only to print what comes apparent to their mind to earn the title of seer. Let it be cut into lengths, with a capital letter at the beginning of each length, and lo! it is a poem. Neither rhyme nor reason is required, and very little decency. One has but to secure an editor like Mr. W. M. Rosetti, and the world is made acquainted with a new poet.</p><p>In the present instance it will require more than Mr. Rosetti's authority, we fear, to make Walt Whitman an acceptable poet to the multitude. However familiar with the future, he is likely to remain a sealed book to the present. This cannot be, of course, any disadvantage to a Kosmos\u2014a Manahatta\u2014a professor of the Tangibilities of Democracy\u2014a singer of the p\u00e6an of natural life. Being all these things, Walt Whitman can afford to wait, and it is highly probable that to wait will be his only alternative.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>*'Poems by Walt Whitman.'

But have they not heard of the 'Music of the Future;' and not only heard of it, but heard it? It is not a thing promised, but a thing accomplished. The foundations of it at least are laid; and even these are pronounced by its prophets to be already superior to the highest summits ever attained by such puny composers of the past as Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven. So is it with the Poetry of the Future. It consists of no merely prophesied strains: the first singer of it is here and amongst us, and his previous productions are to be had at the circulating libraries. True, he is only the first of a long succession of coming bards; but these will follow in his footsteps, as Virgil is said to have trodden in those of Homer, Dante in those of Virgil, Milton in those of Dante, and so on through the sustained inheritance of song. If, as has been seen, we are not overwell satisfied with such productions of the muse as are vouchsafed us by living English bards, we have no reason to distress ourselves, or even to cast fond eyes upon the bygone days of a happier poetical literature, in order to find consolation. We must look forwards, not backwards. Not Byron and his predecessors, but Mr. Walt Whitman and his successors, constitute the balm that still abides in Gilead. The Old World is done up, no doubt; but Apollo has taken refuge in the United States. The pottering little fountain of Hippocrene, now run dry, has been replaced by the tremendous waters of the everlasting Mississippi, and the Parnassian and Heliconian ranges have abdicated in favour of the Alleghanies and the setting sun.</p><p>That our readers may not think we are setting up imaginary claims, we must beg to be permitted to lay before them the proofs of their existence; and we have less scruple in doing so, as we fancy we have in store for them no mean entertainment. To some of them the name of Mr. Walt Whitman will be faintly familiar; but to others, and indeed the majority, we imagine it will represent nothing at all. It is highly desirable that they should become more intimately acquainted with a gentleman who, both through his own voice, and (as we shall shortly see) through the voices of some exceedingly well-known English admirers, affects to be doing so much for the present and future literary greatness of the human race.</p><p>Mr. Walt Whitman was incited to compose the various poems, from which we will make copious citations as we proceed, by a contempt for the Poetry of the Period; and it is obvious that he, therefore, has a special claim upon our attention. His opinion of it is, that it is either 'the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, or more or less musical verbiage, arising out of a life of depression and enervation as their result; or else that class of poetry, plays, &c., of which the foundation is feudalism, with its ideas of lords and ladies, its standard of gentility, and the manners of high life below stairs in every line and verse.' From him we are to expect no such feminine and frivolous stuff; he is as masculine\u2014again another reason for our examining his pretensions\u2014as any of us, sick of the feminine twang of other lyres, can possibly desire:\u2014</p><p>'No dainty dolc\u00e8 affetuoso I;<br>Branded, sunburnt, grey-necked, forbidding, I have arrived,<br>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the universe.'</p><p>He is declared by one of his most ardent admirers, Mr. W.M. Rossetti\u2014to whom we shall have to revert more than once in this paper, and who is esteemed, by a select but somewhat notorious circle, a mighty authority in poetical matters\u2014to 'occupy at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past times, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction, that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one-a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America. He believes that the Columbus of the Continent, or the Washington of the States, was not more truly than himself the patron and founder and upbuilder of this America.'</p><p>That this is no exaggerated account of Mr. Walt Whitman's estimate of himself is apparent on almost every page of his writings, for on page after page it is distinctly laid down:\u2014</p><p>'See, projected through time,<br>For me an audience interminable.<br>Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions;<br>With faces turned sideways or backward towards me, to listen.<br>With eyes retrospective towards Me.'</p><p>'Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian;<br>Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!<br>For you a programme of chants!'</p><p>'In the year 80 of the States,<br>My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from this soil, this air,<br>Born here of parents born here, form parents the same, and their <br>parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-six old, in perfect health begin.<br>Hoping to cease not till death.'</p><p>At another time he exclaims:\u2014</p><p>'For your life, adhere to me;<br>Of all men of the earth, I only can unloose you and toughen you.<br>None have understood you, but I understand you.<br>I have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all.<br>Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens.'</p><p>It is very likely to be objected, that though, perhaps, no such wonderful phenomenon has previously been witnessed as a person believing that within him has taken place so supernatural an operation as the one intimated in the above concluding line, yet the world has seen a goodly number of individuals who proclaimed themselves to be the coming man; and that the estimate formed by Mr. Walt Whitman of himself, is no test of the estimate other people form of him. Let us then come to that; for, after all, that is the most wonderful as it is the most important part of the affair. And, to begin with, let us see what is thought of this poetical avatar by Mr. Rossetti; cramming (for brevity's sake) into one paragraph the diffuse eulogies which this gentleman has passed upon him:\u2014</p><p>Mr. Whitman's poem, he says, 'is, par excellence, the modern poem. . . . It forms incomparably the largest performance of our period in poetry. . . . He breaks with all precedent. . . . His work is practically certain to stand as archetypal for many future poetic efforts. The entire book may be called the p\u00e6an of the natural man. . . . This most remarkable poet is the founder of American poetry, rightly to be called, and the most sonorous poetic voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy. . . . If any thing can cast, in the eyes of posterity, an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal qualities and the great doings of Lincoln, it will assuredly be the written monument reared to him by Whitman. I sincerely believe him to be of the order of great poets, and by no means of pretty good ones. . . . I believe that Whitman is one of the huge, as yet unrecognized, forces of our time-privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by generation after generation of believing and ardent disciples. . . . Poets, said Shelley, are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out for legislation of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken\u2014that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>We think that, after these samples of Mr. Rossetti's opinion as to Mr. Walt Whitman, it will be confessed we have not begun by exaggerating his pretensions as acknowledged in certain quarters. Mr. Rossetti has given utterance to his views in the columns of highly influential critical journals; and his views plainly are, that Mr. Whitman is the Homer of the New World, and that his 'Leaves of Grass' and 'Drum Taps' will be regarded by 'Americanos' to come with the same love and veneration with which European men of letters regard the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p><p>Another of the admirers of this 'unacknowledged legislator' is Mr. Robert Buchanan, himself by profession both a poet and a critic. Mr. Buchanan's opinions on the subject are embodied in a paper published some little time back in the Broadway ; and though he does not like to talk of his author as an artist, and sees plainly enough that he is obviously deficient in certain qualities which have hitherto been deemed indispensable in a poet, he has formed an estimate not much less flattering than Mr. Rossetti's. We will apply to it the same method of compression which we have already employed in the case of the latter:\u2014</p><p>'Walt Whitman,' writes Mr. Buchanan, 'is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates \u2014his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. . . . We are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capabilities for good. . . . He professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in the music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man. . . . He sees in the American future the grandest realisation of centuries of idealism. . . . Thoughts crowd so thick upon him that he has no time to seek their artistic equivalent;* he utters his thoughts in any way, and his expressions gain accidental beauty from the glamour of his sympathy. . . . He is inspired. . . . In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. . . . He is the voice of which America stood most in need. . . . He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied.'</p><p>This, in substance, is Mr. Buchanan's conclusion. But Mr. Rossetti, besides favouring us with his own opinion on the subject, is good enough to inform us of various other critical authorities who are pretty much of his way of thinking. Amongst these he names Mr. William Bell Scott, a name perhaps not very familiar to most of our readers, but which Mr. Rossetti answers for as belonging to 'a true poet and a strong thinker'; and Mr. Scott, he says, considers that the value of Mr. Whitman's poetry is real and great. The name of Mr. Swinburne, however, is known far and wide; and Mr. Rossetti informs us that 'he also is an admirer of Whitman.' Of English newspapers which have paid him a proper tribute, he mentions the Dispatch, the Leader, the London Review, and the Pall Mall Gazette. We have not seen the notices referred to, but we are quite willing to take Mr. Rossetti's word for it that the journals in question have shown themselves 'discerning' in the matter. What meaning Mr. Rossetti attaches to 'discernment,' in estimating Mr. Whitman's literary merits and position-unless, indeed, he would allow that his own estimate is very undiscerning-we have already seen; and though we may be surprised to hear that a journal so little disposed to deal in extravagances on its own account, or to welcome them in others, as the Pall Mall Gazette, has been 'discerning' towards Mr. Walt Whitman in Mr. Rossetti's sense, we suppose it is so. After naming various other literary authorities, who, he says, 'express themselves with no measured enthusiasm,' and referring to an anonymous critic, 'highly entitled to form an opinion on any poetic question, whose admiration and enjoyment of Whitman's greatness grow keener and warmer every time he thinks of him,' Mr. Rossetti crowns his array of flattering testimonies by appealing to Mr. Emerson. The opinion of the latter gentleman is that ' 'Leaves of Grass' is the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.'</p><p>So much for what are called critical opinions. Some people, however, opine that the proof of a poem is in the selling; but here, again, Mr. Walt Whitman's admirers may fairly claim to be able to produce satisfactory evidence. The first edition of 'Leaves of Grass,' consisting of about a thousand copies, was sold off in less than a year. A second edition excited, we are told, 'a considerable storm,' and a further edition, now of between four and five thousand copies, followed. Other editions have since been issued.</p><p>It is perfectly clear, therefore, that, whether we appeal to the judgment of individuals supposed to be possessed of due literary qualifications, or to the great American public, we must accept it as a fact that we are pressingly invited to recognize Mr. Walt Whitman as 'the founder of American poetry,' rightly to be called, 'as one of the order of great poets,' as 'one of the huge forces of our time,' as an 'unacknowledged legislator,' as a voice 'potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken,' as 'the announcer and inspirer of the uttermost avatars of democracy'\u2014in a word, as the founder of the Poetry of the Future.</p><p>Such being the case, let us boldly look this bold man in the face, and see what he is like; for if he really be not only of the order of great poets, but the founder of an absolutely new school of poetry, evidently he is a pearl beyond all price. His fundamental notions of poetry are, we must confess, for the most part correct. 'The direct trial of him,' he says in his preface to 'Leaves of Grass,' 'who would be the greatest poet, is to-day. As if it were necessary to trot back generation after generation to the Eastern records!' We have ourselves so strongly insisted on this point, that we need scarcely say we cordially agree with the sentiments thus expressed. The trial of the great poet is undoubtedly to-day. We, however, have asserted in no doubtful terms that the trial is too great, and that to-day has produced and can produce no great poet. Mr. Whitman says it can and has, and he is the great poet it has produced. The present age has broken with the past, and he has done the same; and he is the great poet of to-day, and the founder of the great Poetry of the Future.</p><p>'See, projected through time,<br>For me an audience interminable.</p><p>'Whoever you are! to you endless announcements.'</p><p>'Daughter of the lands, did you wait for your poets?<br>Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?'</p><p>'Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,<br>Give words\u2014words to the lands.'</p><p>'Still the present I raise aloft\u2014still the future of the States I harbinge, <br>glad and sublime.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman then sings of to-day, and does so of set purpose\u2014a purpose with which we should heartily sympathise if we did not feel the profound conviction that doing so is only lost time. The next question is, What does he see in to-day to sing? He sees four things: namely, America, Democracy, Personality, and Materialism. These for him are the subjects of song both in the present and the future; and he would be a bold man who would deny that, if to-day be the trial of a great poet, these four things may, if not must, properly constitute the great poet's themes. Let us see what he has to say concerning each of them in succession.</p><p>The references to America\u2014its greatness, bigness, wonderfulness\u2014in Mr. Whitman's 'Poems' are incessant; and certainly the glory of one's country has ever been deemed a worthy subject for the muse:</p><p>'Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,<br>For you a programme of chants.<br>Chants of the prairies;<br>Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican <br>sea;'<br>'Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota;<br>Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence equi-<br>distant,<br>Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.'</p><p>'Take my leaves, America! take them South, and take them North!<br>Surround them, East and West! for they would surround you.'</p><p>'I will report all heroism from an American point of view.'</p><br><p>'America always!<br>Always our own feuillage.<br>Always Florida's green peninsula! Always the priceless delta of <br>Louisiana! Always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas!<br>Always,' &c.</p><p>And so on, through pages of what Mr. Rossetti calls 'the first order of poetry.' We need scarcely load our pages with quotations from well-known poets on the subject of their country; we think we may rest content to say that, if the foregoing be poetry at all, all that Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan have written about Rome\u2014all that Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, and Alfieri have written about Italy\u2014all that Scott and Burns have written about Scotland\u2014had better be flung into the dusthole and forgotten. In his preface to 'Leaves of Grass,' Mr. Whitman informs us that 'the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem;' and farther on, in the same production, he declares that 'of all nations, the United States, with veins full of poetical stuff, will doubtless have the greatest poets'\u2014he himself being, as we have seen, the forerunner and first of them. All this, as anybody can perceive who possesses an atom of penetration, arises simply from Mr. Whitman's admiration of bigness\u2014which he mistakes for greatness\u2014attempting to carry it on his shoulders, and staggering under it most woefully. In fact, all the quotations we have as yet made from his 'poems'\u2014and we have so far quoted only the most rational of them\u2014will, we fancy, strike our readers as resembling more what they will imagine must have been the improvising of savages in their literary moods before (if we may be pardoned the bull) letters were known at all.</p><p>'O Camerado close!<br>O you and me at last\u2014and us two only!<br>O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!<br><em>O something ecstatic and indemonstrable! O music wild!'</em></p><p>'All these States compact\u2014every square mile of these States without <br>excepting a particle.<br>O land! O all so dear to me\u2014what you are (wherever it is). I become a <br>part of that, whatever it is!<br>Southward, then, I go screaming, with wings slowly flapping, with the <br>myriad of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida.'</p><p>We confess we think the picture not an inaccurate one. Mr. Walt Whitman screaming, and with wings slowly flapping, realises our notion of him in his poetical condition\u2014this Gull of Mississippi, as opposed to the Swan of Avon\u2014as perfectly as language could well present it to us.</p><p>In connection with this wild inarticulate worship of America must be noticed Mr. Whitman's attempts at what may be called Universality. It is one of the tricks of our time, and, as a matter of course, he is infected with it. Unable, just like many of his somewhat less boisterous contemporaries, to understand the vast problem presented by the past, present, and future of the world, like them again he fancies he has solved it by a clumsy application of the Bene quodcunque est doctrine. Here is his way of expressing himself on the subject:</p><p>'I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;<br>I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demigod;<br>I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true without excep-<br>tion.<br>I assert that all past days were what they should have been.<br>And that they could nohow have been better than they were;<br>And that to-day is what it should be, and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could nohow be better than they are.'</p><p>It is just possible that some people will find this assuring; but we should vastly like to see the person who thinks it poetry, let alone 'the highest order of poetry.' In one of his 'poems,' called 'Salut Au Monde,' he gets hold of the atlas, enumerates nearly every spot on the face of the globe, and says that he sees, hears, and belongs to it. It is done in this fashion:</p><p>'I see the cities of the earth, and make myself at random a part of <br>them;<br>I am a real Parisian;<br>I am a habitant of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople;<br>I am of Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne;<br>I am of London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Limerick;<br>I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brussels, Berne, <br>Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, and Florence.'</p><p>And so on, varied by 'I see,' 'I hear,' 'I behold.' But he goes still farther than this. His 'Universality' embraces not only all places, but all persons, and everything they can do, good, bad, or indifferent:</p><p>'Good or bad, I never question\u2014I love all\u2014I do not condemn any-<br>thing;<br>To me detected persons are not, in any respect, worse than undetected <br>persons\u2014and are not in any respect worse than I am myself.<br>To me any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal with criminals\u2014and <br>any reputable person is also\u2014and the President is also.'</p><p>'Omnes! Omnes! let others ignore what they may;<br>I make the poem of evil also\u2014I commemorate that part also;<br>I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is\u2014<br>And I say there is in fact no evil;<br>Or, if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to <br>me, as anything else.'</p><p>There is much more to the same effect which we cannot possibly quote; but when we add that he avers ugliness to be as welcome to him as beauty, and declares, on one occasion, 'I will sleep with the cleaners of \u2014\u2014' (there is no blank in the original), a fair notion of Mr. Whitman's poetical universality\u2014springing from and invariably returning to the central notion that everything either is America or has been made for it\u2014has been obtained by the reader.</p><p>America thus being the very stock-in-trade of his compositions, democracy, as a matter of course, comes in for considerable glorification, after the author's tumultuous fashion:</p><p>'Democracy!<br>Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully <br>singing!<br>Ma femme!<br>For the brood beyond us and of us!<br>For those who belong here, and those to come.<br>I exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger <br>and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.'</p><p>A story is told of a countryman of Mr. Walt Whitman, who, after reading Mr. Tennyson's 'In Memoriam,' passed on it the not inapt criticism, 'What on airth is the use of screaming against the calm facts of creation?' Mr. Whitman evidently thinks that at any rate, there is a good deal of use in screaming for them. He wishes to see democracy screaming too:</p><p>'Thunder on! stride on. Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!<br>And do you rise higher than ever yet, O days, O cities!<br>Crash heavier, heavier yet, O storms! you have done me good.'</p><p>Borne almost beyond himself, he in one place exclaims:</p><p>'Bully for you! you proud, friendly, free Manhattanese!'</p><p>But, of course, all Americans are equally proud, friendly, and free, and every one of them is just as proud, friendly, free, and everything else, as every other:</p><p>'The wife\u2014and she is not one jot less than the husband<br>The daughter\u2014and she is just as good as the son;<br>The mother\u2014and she is every bit as much as the father.'</p><p>One more quotation, and we will leave this second theme of Mr. Walt Whitman's:</p><p>'I sing the Equalities.<br>I sing the Finale of things.<br>I announce natural persons to arise.<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality.<br>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics <br>of the earth insignificant.'</p><p>His glorification of the individual, or Personality, as he himself loves to call it, is nearly as frequent, and to the full as conspicuous. He never alludes to subordination or co-ordination; he knows them not. The doctrine of Pope, that:</p><p>'Order is Heaven's first law; and, that confessed,<br>Some are and must be better than the rest;'</p><p>or that of Shakespeare:</p><p>'Take but degree away, untune that string,<br>And mark what discord follows'\u2014</p><p>are unknown to him; or, if they are known, he utterly contemns them. As he says, he sings the Equalities, with a large E.</p><p>'I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all-and I will be the <br>bard of personality.'</p><p>Sometimes he glorifies it in himself, sometimes in another, sometimes in himself and another together:</p><p>'Rest not, till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.<br>Go, mon cher! if need be, and inure yourself to self-esteem\u2014ele-<br>vatedness.'</p><p>'I celebrate myself.<br>And what I assume you shall assume.<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>'O my comrade!<br>O you and me at last, and us two only!<br>O to level occupations and the sexes! O to bring all to common <br>ground! O adhesiveness!<br>O the pensive aching to be together\u2014you know not why, and I know <br>not why.'</p><p>'Who need be afraid of the merge?<br>Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded;<br>I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no.'</p><p>'Me imperturbe,<br>Me standing at ease in Nature.<br>Master of all\u2014aplomb in the midst of irrational things.<br>Me private or public (I am eternally equal with the best\u2014I am not <br>subordinate).'</p><p>And, as a matter of course, You doing the same thing, and occupying the same proud position!</p><p>We now arrive at the fourth of the main themes whose glories Mr. Walt Whitman and his admirers consider that he is specially commissioned to sing, or (as he himself expresses it) to 'yawp over the roofs of the world.' We mean\u2014Materialism. We are informed, by one of the many curiositymongers who have busied themselves with Mr. Whitman's private habits\u2014with which we have nothing to do\u2014that he is exceedingly communicative on all subjects save one. If interrogated as to his theological opinions, he turns dead silent. In his compositions, however, he is garrulous enough upon the subject, and, some will think, rather contradictory. We are not of that opinion. It is true he speaks continually of the Soul; but then there is, we should imagine, no word in the language capable of a vague signification, and of being commenced with a capital, that does not find its way into his tumultuous tossing together of the component parts of the dictionary. How far he understands the Soul in any recognized acceptation of the word, our readers will judge for themselves, when they have seen a few of his utterances on the subject:</p><p>'Was somebody asking to see the Soul?<br>See! your own shape and countenance-persons, substances, beasts, <br>the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands!<br>How can the real body ever die and be buried?<br>Behold! the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern\u2014 <br>and includes and is the soul.<br>Whoever you are! how superb and how divine is your body, or any <br>part of it!'</p><p>With him this is a rooted conviction. He says that he is 'divine inside and out,' and with a license of language\u2014which is a mere nothing to what he often indulges in, but which in this instance makes us lose our sense of profanity in an irresistible peal of laughter\u2014he assures us that 'the scent of these armpits is an aroma finer than prayer!' If he worships any particular thing, he says it shall be 'some of the spread of my own body.' One long passage commences thus:</p><p>'O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in either men or women, <br>nor the likes of the parts of you;<br>I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the Soul <br>(and that they are the Soul).<br>Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,<br>Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,<br>Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck slue,<br>Upper arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones,<br>Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone,<br>The thin red jellies within you, or with me\u2014<br>O, I say now, these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but <br>of the Soul!<br>O, I say these are the Soul!'</p><p>It must not be supposed we have quoted the entire passage. We dare not, even if we had space. Suffice it to say that the enumeration covers two long pages, and that, physiologically speaking, it is exhaustive. Nor is his admiration confined to the human body:</p><p>'Beef in the butcher's stall, the area of pens of live pork, the killing- <br>hammer, the hog-hook, the scalder's tub, gutting, the gutter's <br>cleaver, the packer's maul, and the plenteous winter-work of pork- <br>packing.<br>In them poems for you and me.<br>I say that none lead to greater than those lead to.'</p><p>As a concluding and crowning embodiment and expression of Mr. Whitman's Materialism, let us take the following:\u2014</p><p>'I will make the poems of materials, for I think these are to be the <br>most spiritual poems.<br>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,<br>For I shall then supply myself with the poems of the Soul, and of <br>immortality.<br>Strange and hard that paradox true I give;<br>Objects gross and the unseen Soul are one.'</p><p>We trust that no one has supposed that, in giving extracts from Mr. Walt Whitman's 'poems,' as far as they relate to America, Democracy, Personality, and Materialism, we have been intending to turn his opinions into ridicule, or even to quarrel with him in the least for holding them. We need scarcely say that his opinions are not ours, but neither are those of Mr. Swinburne or Doctor Newman; yet we believe it will be allowed that we attempted to cast no slur on the opinions of either of those writers. That is not the function of the purely literary critic. Mr. Whitman is as heartily welcome to his views of the Universe, as far as we are concerned, as anybody else is: and if we have brought them into prominence, it is only because we thought that our account of him would thus be made both more entertaining and more complete; whilst at the same time we should be compelled to make quotations from him with obvious impartiality, and the reader would obtain just as fair an idea of his literary merits as if we had proceeded in a less methodical fashion.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's opinions, therefore, be his own, without any controversy from us! But we do not think we should be doing our duty, either to ourselves or the true interests of literature, if we did not inform our readers, who may possibly have been just a little offended by certain of the passages we have cited, that his 'poems' swarm with pages upon pages of whose horrible and ineffable nastiness they cannot possibly form any conception. Mr. Rossetti\u2014who is the editor of the English edition, and who has omitted from it the parts to which we chiefly refer\u2014considers that most of them would be better away, and doubts whether even one of them, deserves to be retained in the exact phraseology it at present exhibits. We wish Mr. Rossetti had contented himself with this avowal, quite insufficient under the circumstances as we think it. Unfortunately, he has blanced this mild reprobation by the averment, in another place, that he has excluded the 'poems' to which we refer, out of deference to 'the propriety of the peculiarly nervous age,' and that he 'sacrifices them grudgingly.' We think we have shown ourselves not particularly squeamish; but if we were to print the very least offensive of the passages alluded to\u2014though they circulate freely in America\u2014the days of this magazine would very justly be numbered.</p><p>Anybody who considers the matter will see that this has a direct bearing on the purely literary side of the question. Mr. Whitman over and over again protests that he has no shame. As Mr. Buchanan\u2014mildly even\u2014puts it for him, 'He sees that the beasts are not ashamed; why, therefore, should he be ashamed?' here we have it. He recognizes no shame, no law, no forms, no good, no evil, no beauty, no ugliness, no distinctions, differences, or limitations. This, of course, will account for the disconnectedness of his utterances, and the utter disorder of his language. We suspect that many of our readers will here be inclined to say, what doubtless they have long been thinking\u2014'What is the use of proving the self-evident, that all which Mr. Walt Whitman writes is stark staring nonsense, both in substance and in form equally?' We can fully sympathise with the impatience which prompts such an interruption; but whilst doing so, we would ask them to turn once again to the encomiums passed by others upon these productions, which we cited at starting in order to protect ourselves against the notion that we were wasting our powder. With regard to the form of Mr. Whitman's compositions, we would ask them to attend for a moment to what Mr. Rossetti and Mr. Buchanan, let alone others equally pretending to authority, have to say on this particular point.</p><p>'Whitman's poems,' writes the former, 'present no trace of rhyme save in a couple or so of chance instances. Parts of them, indeed, may be regarded as a warp of prose amid the weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare furnishes the precedent for in drama. Still there is a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense throughout.'</p><p>Mr. Buchanan, as we have seen, writes with much more moderation than Mr. Rossetti; but even he asserts that Mr. Whitman's language is 'strong, vehement, always forcible, and sometimes even rhythmical, like the prose of Plato;' that his lines are 'lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence;' and that he has 'risen on the States to point the way to new literatures.'</p><p>Such, then, being the opinions which, it must be presumed, some people in these strange days entertain, since they express them, of Mr. Walt Whitman's literary claims, we think it right, if only to liberate our souls\u2014and we should imagine those of most of our readers\u2014emphatically, but in all serious calmness, to declare, on the contrary, our opinion, that his style has nothing in common with either the Bible, Shakspeare, Plato, or any other hitherto honoured name in literature; but that his grotesque, ungrammatical, and repulsive rhapsodies can be fitly compared only to the painful ravings of maniacs' dens.</p><p>Such, however, is the Poetry of the Future? Perhaps it is. If so, we must console ourselves by reflecting that, unsatisfactory as may be the Poetry of the Period, if we had been born a generation later still, our poetical plight would have been yet worse than it is. Yet we shrewdly suspect that one is the child of the other. Mr. Whitman himself distinctly says that it is. As we have already stated, he informs us that he was urged to lay the foundations of the Poetry of the Future, because, in his opinion, that of the Period is 'the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, or more or less musical verbiage'\u2014in a word, because, as we ourselves have been urging in those papers, it is deficient in all masculine and lofty qualities. Mr. Whitman revolts against it; and his is a revolt with a vengeance. Mr. Tennyson and his admirers have been fancying that they had swept and garnished the Halls of Literature, got rid of all such objectionable robustness as figures in the verse of Shakespeare, a Byron, or a Burns, and made the place sweet, trim, and pretty for all time. But, alas! seven devils worse than the first have entered, and its state promises to be more terrible than ever. Nor are we sure that there is not a good deal of truth in what Mr. Whitman says of the same school of poetry being based on a now extinct feudalism, and on standards of gentility belonging to a somewhat later period. At any rate, he will have none of these. As Mr. Rossetti reminds us, it has been said of Mr. Whitman by one of his warmest admirers, 'He is Democracy.' We really think he is\u2014in his compositions, at least; being, like it, ignorant, sanguine, noisy, coarse, and chaotic! Democracy may be, and we fear is, our proximate future; and it will, as a matter of course, bring its poetry along with it. The prospect is not an agreeable one; but, as a protection both against it and our present condition, we can always fall back upon the grand old masters of the Past, from whom it is quite certain that singers, whether insipid or insane, will never succeed in weaning the healthy opinion of mankind.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>*As if poetical thoughts did not always bring their artistic equivalent with them!-the thought and the form, or expression, being one.

Up to the time mentioned, the facts that a new poet had arisen in America, and that much difference of opinion existed as to his merits, were of no special interest.</p><p>Every author has, at one period or another, met with the cross of harsh, undeserved criticism. And with many, such injustice is prejudicial to the acquisition of fame. With Walt Whitman the case is different. He has a self-imposed task to perform; he is to furnish the great 'psalm of the Republic,' the poem of Personality\u2014Personality as it exists in America; and, wrapped in 'sublime egotism'\u2014the egotism of a man who feels himself a king upon earth, not 'wearing the purple,' but in the humble guise of a working man, one whose genius</p><p>'Knows no end,<br>And will to countless years extend<br>Undimm'd, unstained, in glow;'</p><p>he has gone through with his work. The vastness of the territory of America, the grandeur of her natural scenery, the magnitude of her undertaking, and the greatness of her democratic institutions\u2014are themes that, up to the present time, have needed a poet who can enter into the true spirit of the American nation, and think and speak in a way to illustrate such spirit.</p><p>Old world poets, fettered by rules, chained down to precedents, fearing the critic's scourge, thinking less of the affection of the 'common people' than of the admiration of literary circles, have not attained the high level of this new world theme. The tendency of English and American poetry has been hitherto chastening and refining; the Titanic vigour, energy, and intensity of Whitman, seem like the growth of an American forest tree beside a lovely English garden plant; each in its kind is beautiful, but the soul is far more deeply stirred by the former.</p><p>In order fully to understand the character of Walt Whitman's writings, the reader should first be made acquainted with the man and his history. Biography affords valuable aid to the student seeking to fathom the depths of poetry. The outward life of a man is often the key to the inner\u2014the working of the mind. In Whitman this is noticeable. He was born at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, in the Manhattan state, 'well begotten and raised of a perfect mother,' on the 31st of May, 1819. His family, of English origin, had been settled in the locality for five generations. Walt was one of a large family. The father, Walter Whitman, after whom he was christened, was a farmer, and afterwards a carpenter and builder, adhering in religion to the great quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks. Walt was schooled at Brooklyn, and began life in a printing office, at the age of thirteen, subsequently turning his attention to teaching, and later still becoming a 'miscellaneous press-writer' in New York. In 1849 he began to travel, and became newspaper editor at New Orleans, and afterwards a printer at Brooklyn, the place of his schooldays. With that versatile genius which enables Americans of every class to adapt themselves to circumstances, and follow every pursuit, he next followed his father's business of carpentry. This was his occupation until the outbreak of the great civil war in 1862, when he undertook the duty of nursing the sick and wounded. Mr. Rosetti, to whom I am indebted for these particulars, adds that it was through Emerson's intervention that Whitman obtained President Lincoln's sanction to carry on this work of charity 'without fee or reward,' and to draw army rations. Howe'er it be, we know that the 'Concord sage' was one of the first to recognise Whitman's merits, in a letter addressed to the poet, greeting him 'at the beginning of a great career;' and pronouncing Leaves of Grass 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' As a hospital nurse, Whitman proved the nobleness of his nature by his untiring devotion to the sick and wounded, and a tenderness almost womanly in its extremity. Some of his most striking poems are the outcome of his experiences whilst fulfilling the self-imposed duties of this charitable office. In 1864, Whitman caught his first severe illness, from the absorption of poison into his system whilst attending to 'some of the worst cases of gangrene,' and was incapacitated for a period of six months, but in 1865 returned to the hospitals, and also obtained a clerkship in the department of the Interior, from which he was dismissed because of the free speech on things of a gross nature, in Leaves of Grass. He has since obtained, like many other eminent American writers, a post under Government, in the department of the Attorney-General. Whitman's dismissal from the department of the Interior, which was enforced by Secretary Harlan, caused some little indignation and a pamphleteering controversy: hence his reinstatement to Government employment.</p><p>In manners and habit of life, Whitman is peculiar. The privilege of genius to be eccentric would appear to be exercised in his case to the full; but his eccentricity and genius are en rapport, and bear a singular consistency. Rugged, plain, outspoken, and sensitive in his verse, the poet is the same in his daily life. Mr. Conway has, however, in an article in the Fortnightly Review for October, 1866, given an admirable account of a visit to the poet who, he states, he searched out with a view of giving some report concerning him to his friends. After detailing how he found the small, wooden house of two stories, in which Whitman resided, 'after journeying through the almost interminable and monotonous streets which stretch out upon the fish-shaped Panmanok,' Mr. Conway adds:\u2014</p><p>'The day was excessively hot\u2014the thermometer at nearly 100 deg., and the sun blazed down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze. The common had not a single tree or shelter, and it seemed to me that only a very devout fire worshipper could be found there on such a day. No human being could I see at first in any direction; but just as I was about to turn, I saw, stretched upon his back and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was seeking. With his grey clothing, his blue grey shirt, his iron grey hands, his swart sun-browned face and bare neck, he laid upon the brown and white grass\u2014for the sun had burnt away its greenness\u2014and was so like the earth upon which he rested, that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to pass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name, and my reason for finding him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot. 'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then walked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room\u2014a small room of about fifteen square feet, with a single window looking out on the barren solitude of the island\u2014a small cot, a washstand, with a little looking glass hung over it from a tack in the wall, a pine table with pen, ink, and paper on it, an old line engraving representing Bacchus hung on the wall, and opposite a similar one of Silenus. These constituted the visible endowments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a single book in the room. In reply to my expression of a desire to see his books, he declared that he had very few. I found upon further inquiry that he had received only such a good English education as every American lad may receive from the public schools, and that he now had access to the libraries of some of his friends. The books he seemed to love best, were the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare; these he owned, and probably had in his pocket while we were talking. He had two studies, where he read; one was the top of an omnibus, and the other a small mass of sand\u2014then entirely uninhabited\u2014far out in the ocean, called Coney Island. . . . I could not help suspecting that he must have had masters, but he declared that he had learned all that he knew from omnibus drivers, ferry boat pilots, fisherman, boatmen, and the men and women of the markets and wharves. These were all inarticulate poets, and he interpreted them. The only distinguished contemporary he had ever met, was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn, who had visited him. He had, he said, asked Mr. Beecher what were his feelings when he heard a man swear; and that gentleman having admitted that he felt shocked, he (Whitman) concluded that he still preferred keeping to the boatmen for his company.' Mr. Conway says that Walt Whitman impressed him favourably, socially, physically, and intellectually, and he adds his praise, not unmixed with surprise, to the testimony of Emerson in his favour. Thoreau, Robert Buchanan, Swinburne, and others, have also recognized Whitman's genius; and what, perhaps, is even more satisfactory still to Whitman, he has gained the love and admiration of thousands of his countrymen, who see in his poems the expression of their national nature and spirit.</p><p>Space does not allow of a criticism of Whitman's poetry, but we subjoin a specimen of his verse. The spirit of Democracy breathes through every line that he has set to paper, although in many of his pieces he mistakes the conception of a poetic idea in his own mind for the expression of it.</p><p>In the case of Whitman's poetry comparison becomes impossible. He stands single and alone in the poetic circle\u2014the personification of Democracy. The verses given below are not chosen because of superior merit, but simply as illustrating different phases of the poet's mind:\u2014</p><p><em>1861.</em><br>ARMED year! year of the struggle!<br>No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year!<br>Not you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas piano;<br>But as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying <br>a rifle on your shoulder,<br>With well gristled body and sunburnt face and hands\u2014with a knife in <br>the belt at your side,<br>As I heard you shouting loud\u2014your sonorous voice ringing across the <br>continent;<br>Your masculine voice, O year, as, rising amid the great cities,<br>Amid the man of Manhattan I saw you, as one of the workmen, the <br>dwellers in Manhattan;<br>Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,<br>Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the <br>Alleghanies;<br>Or down from the great lakes, or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the <br>Ohio river;<br>Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at Chatta- <br>nooga on the mountain top,<br>Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limb, clothed in blue, bearing <br>weapons, robust year;<br>Heard your determined voice, launched forth again and again;<br>Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipped cannon,<br>I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.</p><p><em>NOCTURN FOR THE DEATH OF LINCOLN.</em><br>O CAPTAIN! my captain! our fearful trip is done!<br>The ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring.<br>But, O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot<br>Where on the deck my captain lies,<br>Fallen Cold and Dead.</p><p>O captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells!<br>Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills;<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you the shore's a-crowding;<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning.<br>O captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you.<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will;<br>But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed and done;<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won!<br>Exult O shores! and ring O bells!<br>But I, with silent tread,<br>Walk the spot; my captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p>", "date": "November 1869", "year": 1869, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Australian Journal: A Weekly Record of Literature, Science and the Arts", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman, The American Poet of Democracy.\" November 1869.

They are in a singular, unrhymed style; sometimes in irregular hexameters, sometimes in the Ossianic metre, sometimes in that of Hiawatha, sometimes absolutely prosaic, but always original and audaciously American. We do not rate him, like one of his editors here, as one of the greatest poets that ever lived, but he is unquestionably a great and original poet. He sets all conventionality at defiance. He is as free in his style, his thoughts, his sentiments, as the most Yankee and pretentious of his countrymen. His brag about the Great Republic and everything belonging to the States is of the most preposterous and laughable kind. His exuberance of imagery, his cataloguings of everything that comes in his head of every possible thing in this globe, or in the universe, is frequently oppressive; but amidst all this extravagance, verbiage, and tautology there rises a continual stream of the brightest new thoughts, the tenderest and most dewy sentiments and kindly human feelings, like the cool and rapid rushing of a mountain-born river beneath the green boughs of the forest or through the flowery grass of the summer meadow. The character of the philosophy of these poems, however, is what we desire now particularly to call attention to. It is of that advanced and transcendental kind which belongs only to writers who have been baptized into the true Jordan of Spiritualism, and have ascended from its banks into the borders of the Summer Land, walking there with ever-increasing wonder, and bringing thence the flowers and fruits of a new and eternal promise; grapes of the true vine; and golden gatherings from the trees of both knowledge and life. All such visitors of the world beyond come back with a newness of aspect, of manner, of speech, and tone of mind, that are unmistakable. We know them at once by the eye beaming with the light that shines on the mountains of the imperishable; by the joy that flushes the features of those who have walked and talked with the angels; by the broad spirit of sympathy which brings to the earth the illimitable fervour of the heavens, and sees in the smallest thing, in the humblest mortal, the signs of the wonder-working of the Infinite Spirit of creative and supporting Love. This is what we see at once in the poems of Walt Whitman: and he at once responds to our challenge, 'Poet, thou art one of us!' with these words:</p><p>As for me (torn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehement days;)<br>I have the idea of all and am all, and believe in all:<br>I believe Materialism is true, and Spiritualism is true\u2014I reject no part.</p><p>Nor do we: Materialism is as true as Spiritualism when it is united to Spiritualism; it is false, or rather defective only, when it is a mere part.</p><p>In a succeeding poem, we have him clearly in trance, and the impressing spirit speaking through him:\u2014</p><p>Take my hand, Walt Whitman!<br>Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!<br>Such joined unended links, each hooked to the next!<br>Each answering all\u2014each sharing the earth with all.</p><p>What widens within you, Walt Whitman?<br>What waves and soils exuding?<br>What climes? what persons and lands are here?<br>Who are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?<br>Who are the girls? who are the married women?<br>Who are the three old men going slowly with their arms about each other's necks?<br>What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?<br>What are the mountains called that rise so high in the mists?<br>What myriads of dwellings are they, filled with dwellers?</p><p>Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;<br>Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east\u2014America is provided for in the west:<br>Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator;<br>Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends;<br>Within me is the longest day\u2014the sun wheels in slanting rings\u2014it does not set for months<br>Stretched in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon and sinks again;<br>Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,<br>Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian Islands.</p><p>What do you hear, Walt Whitman?</p><p>But Walt Whitman sees and hears everything in the earth. The poem which he calls 'Salut au Monde' is a long one. We have enough of it here to understand it, which readers at large both in America and here have not done, but have showered on the mediumistic poet all the epithets of 'fool, madman, idiot,' which the critic vocabulary can so plentifully furnish, with occasional praise equally extravagant. We have the key, and all is to us lucid as the sky and saner far than his deriders. How perfectly spiritual is this passage,\u2014amongst the sights 'of the deaths of the bodies of Gods'\u2014Christ and others:\u2014</p><p>I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved, saying to the people, Do not weep for me,<br>This is not my true country, I have lived banished from my true country\u2014 I now go back there;<br>I return to the celestial sphere, where every one goes in his turn.</p><p>In the 'Song of the Broad Axe' we have the same unmistakable spirit vision:\u2014</p><p>I see the European headsman:<br>He stands masked, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong, naked arms,<br>And leans on a ponderous axe.</p><p>Whom have you slaughtered lately, European headsman?<br>Whose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?</p><p>I see the sunset of the Martyrs;<br>I see from the scaffolds of the descending ghosts,<br>Ghosts of dead lords, uncrowned ladies, impeached ministers, rejected kings,</p><p>Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest.<br>I see those who in any land have died for the good cause;<br>The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out.<br>(Mind you, O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out).</p><p>But let us take a few passages as they occur seriatim in the volume. Here is one which again proclaims his purpose:\u2014</p><p>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.<br>Here lands female and male;<br>Here the heirship and heiress-ship of the world\u2014here the flame of materials;<br>Here Spirituality, the translatress, the open-avowed,<br>The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms;<br>The satisfier, after due, long waiting, now advancing,<br>Yes, here comes my mistress, the Soul.</p><p>The Soul!<br>For ever and for ever\u2014longer than soil is brown and solid\u2014longer than water ebbs and flows.<br>I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems;<br>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,<br>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and immortality.</p><p>To be truly spiritual is to be devout, and he adds\u2014</p><p>I say no man has ever been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough;<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is.</p><p>But the spiritual poet must shew this:\u2014</p><p>The unseen and the seen;<br>Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;<br>Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me;<br>Living beings, identities, now doubtless near us, in the air, that we know not of;<br>Contact daily and hourly that will not release me.</p><p>And he proceeds:\u2014</p><p>I will make the true poem of riches,\u2014<br>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward and is not dropped at death.</p><p>And again, of death and the soul:\u2014</p><p>Was somebody asking to see the Soul?<br>See! your own shape and countenance\u2014persons, substances, beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.<br>All hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them:<br>How can the real body ever die and be buried?<br>Of your real body, and any man's or woman's real body,<br>Item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners, and pass to fitting spheres,<br>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death.</p><p>In the most outward city pageant the open-eyed poet sees what the mere world-eyed mass never sees. In the reception of the Japanese Embassy at New York, he says:\u2014</p><p>I do not know whether others behold what I behold,<br>In the procession, along with the Princes of Asia, the errand-bearers,<br>Bringing up the rear, hovering above, or in the ranks marching;<br>But I will sing you a song of what I behold<br>* * * * * *<br>Not the errand-bearing princes, nor the tanned Japanese only;<br>Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears\u2014the Past, the Dead.<br>The murky night-morning of wonder and fable, inscrutable,<br>The enveloped mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,<br>The North\u2014the sweltering South\u2014Assyria\u2014the Hebrews\u2014the Ancient of ancients,<br>Vast, desolated cities\u2014the gliding Present\u2014all of these, and more are in the pageant procession.</p><p>Yes! to the poet of the opened eye\u2014the spiritual poet and seer\u2014all worlds and ages are open. The walls of Time, the barriers of the distant and of ages are thrown down; the manacles of the flesh are rent asunder; the mortal film has fallen from the eye of the temporal probationer, and, spirit-like, he walks cognizant amid the free things of the imperishable spheres. All times, people, regions, are present with him. He sees everything as it is, and knows better than ever that everything is miracle.</p><p>Let us see what he says on this point:\u2014</p><p><em>MIRACLES.</em></p><p><em>1.</em><br>What shall I give? And what are my miracles?</p><p><em>2.</em><br>Realism is mine\u2014my miracles\u2014Take freely,<br>Take without end\u2014I offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you, or your eyes reach.</p><p><em>3.</em><br>Why! who makes much of miracles?<br>As for me I know of nothing else but miracles,<br>Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,*<br>Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,<br>Or wade with naked feet, along the beach, just in the edge of the water,<br>Or stand under trees in the woods,<br>Or talk with any one I love,<br>Or sit at the table with my mother,<br>Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,<br>Or watch honey-bees busy round the hive, of a summer forenoon,<br>Or animals feeding in the fields,<br>Or birds\u2014or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,<br>Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down\u2014or of stars shining, so quiet and bright,<br>Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;<br>Or whether I go among those I like best, and that like me best\u2014mechanics, boatmen, farmers,<br>Or among the savans\u2014or to the soir\u00e9e\u2014or to the opera,<br>Or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,<br>Or behold children at their sports,<br>Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,<br>Or the sick in the hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,<br>Or my own eyes and figure in the glass;<br>These, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,<br>The whole referring\u2014yet each distinct and in its place.</p><p><em>4.</em><br>To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,<br>Every inch of space is a miracle,<br>Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same;<br>Every cubit foot of the interior swarms with the same;<br>Every spear of grass\u2014the frames, limbs, organs of men and women, and all that concerns them,<br>All these are to me unspeakably perfect miracles.</p><p>To me the sea is a continual miracle;<br>The fishes that swim\u2014the rocks\u2014the motion of the waves\u2014the ships with men in them,<br>What stranger miracles are there?</p><p>But enough: our object is not to bring forward all the spiritual matter of the volume\u2014for it is all spiritual; we want only to shew our readers that another spiritual poet is amongst us, whom the world accepts because it thinks him merely eccentric and original. The poetry of Harris is very fine, but then he said out plumply that the spirits of departed poets gave it him, and the wise ones turned up their eyes and went on. Walt Whitman does not say that any spirit gave him these poems, but he shews it in every line to the initiated. It is alive with that fresh, new, piquant, magical life that no mere poet of the world, no Browning, or Swinburne, or Locker has. The moment that you dip into this poetry, you feel the stir and heavings of the limitless ocean of the God-world of deathless powers beneath; you are immersed in the eternal springs and streams of primal being. The harmonies and airs of the Summer Land are around you. You see and hear and feel and know with a new rush of faculties and consciousnesses which make even the most surprising of material discoveries flat and poor, for they penetrate only into the outer surface of outer things. Here you touch the fire-springs of creative life; you bathe in the life fountains; you are one with the countless hosts of the wise, the beautiful, the loving, who have emerged from the larva cells of earth into the perfected zones of eternal peace and poetry. What says your poet of his state there?</p><p>I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things:<br>They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.</p><p>His companions are yours: hear again!</p><p>Wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and hardly cover them.\u2014Beyond these I pass,<br>Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go,<br>Solitary, smelling the earthly smell, stopping now and then in the silence;<br>Alone I had thought\u2014yet soon a silent troop gathers around me;<br>Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms and neck.<br>They, the spirits of friends dead or alive\u2014thicker they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,<br>Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them.<br>* * * * * * *<br>And twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,<br>And stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar.<br>These, I, compassed around by a thick cloud of spirits,<br>Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,<br>Indicating to each one what he shall have\u2014giving something to each.</p><p>With your poet you say finally\u2014</p><p>Now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, I will measure myself by them;<br>And now, touched with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along as those of the earth,<br>Or waiting to arrive, or passed on farther than those of the earth,<br>Thenceforth I no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,<br>Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.<br>O I see now that life can not exhibit all to me\u2014as the day can not,<br>I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.</p><p>Thus daily, whilst the earth porers of science pause and wonder, and then shrink from their own wondering, the broad day of the soul breaks more broadly; rushes on more peremptorily; spirits, issuing from their shy seclusion, speak out aloud, sing in troops and choruses to ears no longer astonished; come visibly and palpably; scatter over us flowers of heaven and of earth, make fire innocuous and touch disease into health; and poets, springing up here and there in the crowds, utter words of faith and vision ever and ever more startling and strong. It is high time that he that would have the credit of being wise should revise his wisdom, and let the mingling earth and heavens speak out to him of the new birth of things\u2014new facts, new perceptions, new sights more wonderful than dreams, new sense of things, of justice, love, truth, pacification, and law\u2014God in his world living through all in one perpetual and illimitable miracle.</p><p>I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!<br>That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it!<br>And all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and death are altogether for it!</p><p>And this invincible conviction is the backbone and substance of the new dispensation in which the poet tells us in his preface,'From the eyesight proceeds another eyesight, and from the hearing proceeds another hearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious of the harmony of things with man.'</p><p>True, Walt Whitman!

The war of independence, the final separation of the two countries, the lapse of nearly a century since the latter event, the great difference between the natural scenery of the United States and England, the composite character of their population, and the ever-increasing influx of Germans and other foreigners, have all operated in directions wide of ours as to the forms of the expression of thought, yet have, nevertheless, left the higher literature, and particularly the romance and poetry, of the Republic, absolutely identical with our own as to language. But in spite of this identity of language, the poetry of America is strictly national. It has a flavour of its own, like an American apple. It differs as completely from English poetry as a prairie from a moor, an acacia mimosa from a sensitive plant, sassafras and maple from birch and oak, or a squatter in a log-hut from a farm labourer in a cottage. Though it is, like the poets who produced it, the offspring of England, it has grown up under foreign skies, unlike its parent as the Mississippi is unlike the Thames and the Alleghany mountains differ from the Snowdon range. In the aboriginal Indian traditions, in particular, American poets have sources of originality so abundant that we have nothing that can be compared with it among ourselves. The Celtic and Gaelic legends, which gleam brightly through the pages of Ossian and the 'Irish Melodies,' are faint in comparison with the Indian traditions that blaze through the 'Song of Hiawatha.'</p><p>It is to scenery, principally, that poets in general are indebted for their hold on the minds of others. Important as it is that they should be melodious, should sound the depths of the human heart, and depict exactly the lights and shades of character, it is to scenery, or, in other words, to nature, that they owe their most striking images and illustrations. The American poet has a rich treasury of poetic imagery in his native land. In variety and grandeur, it can hardly be equalled. It is as marked as the imagery of Hafiz, Saadi, and the Sanscrit drama, and has many more elements of strength. For distinctness and beauty it stands beside the imagery of Sicily in the Idyllia of Theocritus; of Mantua and Cremona in the Bucolics of Maro; of Castile and Navarre in the Spanish ballads translated by Lockhart; of Windsor Forest in Pope and Shelley's 'Alastor'; of the Rhine and the Hartz Mountains in the songs of Goethe and the lyrics of Schiller. 'The Americans,' says Walt Whitman, 'of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto, the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night. Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations. Here is action untied from strings, necessarily blind to particulars and details, magnificently moving in vast masses.'</p><p>Let us take a few pictures of American scenery drawn by master-hands.

We traced the rise of American poetry, and passed briefly in review the writings of Mrs. Sigourney, the chief poetess of the United States, of the classical William Cullen Bryant, the Catholic aspects of Longfellow, the Quaker-like purity of Bayard Taylor's verse, the Catholic poetry to be found in periodicals, and the moralizing humour of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Resuming our subject at the point where we were obliged to break off, we now proceed with our intended sketch of those poets in America who have distinguished themselves most highly in their own country, and have the best claim to be welcomed in ours.</p><p>In his 'Incident in a Railway car,' James Russell Lowell has inserted what seems to give his ideal of poetry\u2014at least of poetry in his own hands.</p><p>Never did Poesy appear<br>So full of heaven to me, as when<br>I saw how it would pierce through pride and fear<br>To the lives of coarsest men.</p><p>It may be glorious to write<br>Thoughts that shall glad the two or three<br>High souls, like those far stars that come in sight<br>Once in a century;\u2014</p><p>But better far it is to speak<br>One simple word, which now and then<br>Shall waken their free nature in the weak<br>And friendless sons of men;</p><p>To write some earnest verse or line<br>Which, seeking not the praise of art,<br>Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine<br>In the untutored heart.</p><p>He who doth this, in verse or prose,<br>May be forgotten in his day,<br>But surely shall be crowned at last with those<br>Who live and speak for aye.</p><p>In accordance with this view, James Russell Lowell has declined from the higher walks of poetry\u2014from rivers raging among rocks and trees bronzed with Indian summers\u2014from ideas and scenes such as would have rejoiced Keats, Shelley, and Tennyson$to give vent to his political principles in humorous pieces written in the Yankee dialect. His fame was made by the 'Biglow Papers,' which may be regarded as an anathema on the Mexican War; and in these Papers his democratic proclivities and his burning hatred of slavery recommend themselves to notice in musical and comic verse. They are pervaded also with moral earnestness, and marked by strange spelling, colloquial familiarities, and frequent allusions to Holy Writ. The phraseology is often scriptural, and the irreverence which they display must be ascribed, not to the author, but to the habits of the people whose patois he adopts. Englishmen cannot but be shocked when the Supreme Being is treated with American freedom. But beneath Lowell's free-and-easy diction, his rude and homely satire, and never-failing fun, there is a substratum of fine feeling, scholarship, and sound sense, which compensates for many flaws. We would rather see the name of God used with honest, though undue familiarity, than ignored altogether, as by Walt Whitman, the apostle of matter and the idolater of the flesh. The following stanzas, taken from the anti-slavery poem, the 'Cruetin Sarjint,' will illustrate our point.</p><p>Ez for war, I call it murder-<br>There you hev it plain an' flat;<br>I don't want to go no furder<br>Than my Testyment fer that;<br>God hez said so plump an' fairly,<br>It's ez long ez it is broad,<br>An' you've gut to git up airly<br>Ef you want to take in God.</p><p>'Taint your eppyletts an' feathers<br>Make the thing a grain more right;<br>'Taint a follerin' you bell-wethers<br>Will excuse ye in His sight;<br>Ef you take a sword an' dror it,<br>An' go stick a feller thru,<br>Gu'ment aint to answer for it,<br>God'll send the bill to you.</p><p>Wuts the use o' meetin-goin'<br>Every Sabbuth, wet or dry,<br>Ef it's right to go amowin'<br>Feller-men like oats an' rye?<br>I dunno but wut it's pooty<br>Trainin' round in bobtail coats,\u2014<br>But it's curus Christian dooty<br>This ere cuttin' folks's troats<br>\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217<br>Jest go home an' ask our Nancy<br>Whether I'd be sech a goose<br>Es to jine ye,\u2014guess you'd fancy<br>The eternal bung waz loose!<br>She wants me fer home consumtion,<br>Let alone the hay's to mow,\u2014<br>Ef you're arter folks o'gumption,<br>You've a darned long row to hoe.</p><p>Who would suspect that this comic strain proceeded from the author of 'My Study Window,' and 'Among my Books'\u2014volumes of essays replete with every sign of extensive learning and refined taste? If Lowell's Essays have a literary fault, it is that they are too clever\u2014full to over flowing of pointed allusions, images, and anecdotes. It would be well sometimes if his mind were less wealthy, or if he forgets some of his riches. He takes us too often off the line, to pick up a beautiful shell, or admire a choice plant. He overcharges his page with illustrations. His luxuriance resembles that of many a plain in Southern climes, where you are knee-deep in flowers and cannot make way through the long grasses and aromatic shrubs. If such be the opulence of Lowell's prose, it would be surprising if his poetry, whether serious or humorous, were not marked by peculiar beauties. The 'Cathedral' and 'Under the Willows, and other Poems' cannot fail to gratify all who can distinguish between verse and poetry. Lowell does not merely imitate beauty, he creates it; and the creation of beauty is the essence of poetry. In all compositions which have been really received as poems, we shall find that the imaginative or, speaking more properly, the creative parts only, have insured them their success. This essential, for which we sigh so often in reading what would be poetry and is only rhyme, or perhaps not even that, is decidedly not wanting in Lowell's effusions. They have in them a principle of life, a subtle ingenuity and an inward glow. The word and the thought are as bride and bridegroom, according to that spirited precept:\u2014</p><p>Sei die Braut das Wort<br>Br\u00e4utigam der Geist.</p><p>'The Heritage,' for example, concentrates much power and feeling in exalting the lot of the poor above that of the rich. There may be some straining of the argument, some special pleading, some designed forgetfulness of the many temptations inseparable from poverty, but poetry is not always to be taken au fond de la lettre; it is enough for poetic purposes that it treats any one subject beautifully and satisfactorily from a particular point of view. 'The Dandelion' is another of Lowell's poems enfolding in its bosom much poetic wealth. He speaks of the flower as 'fringing the dusty roads with harmless gold'; of children as 'high-hearted buccaneers,' who pluck and hold up the dandelion, 'o'erjoyed, that they an El Dorado in the grass have found'; he calls it 'the Spring's largess,' which most hearts never understand to take at God's value. He encircles it, in short, with the rainbow colours of a heart alive to the delicate traceries of Nature's hand. He is full of feeling, without sentimentality, and full of art without being artificial. Granted that the highest and most spiritual condition of man is one of continuous joy and content, there is, nevertheless, something in humanity so sad, so compassed about with every species of infirmity, that poetry loses half its power and sweetness when it ceases to make pain beautiful and sighs melodious. Lowell has all the wailing which belongs to a child of song, and perfectly understands how tears are expressive of the deepest emotions, whether of sorrow or joy. Yet he is full of hope, and believes that mainspring of all heroic deeds and sufferings to be divine in its nature and origin:\u2014</p><p>Nor is he far astray who deems<br>That every hope, which rises and grows broad<br>In the world's heart, by ordered impulse streams<br>From the great heart of God.<br>God wills, man hopes.</p><p>Rich as we are in poets of our own country, we often find it difficult to believe that, in the commerce of the mind, we have much to gain by the importation among us of poetry of the United States. Longfellow, indeed, we have long regarded almost as one of ourselves, but with this exception there is among English readers in general little knowledge or appreciation of American poetry. We are apt to look on Yankees in the mass as vulgar, sectarian, swaggering, democratic, money-worshiping folk, who have degraded the English language to a colonial level. But whatever advantages the Mother Country may have over the new Republic, they are balanced, and the Americans would think overbalanced, by advantages on the other side. Purity of style and diction is certainly not lost among their writers of the higher order, and in the vast territory of the United States there is more than enough material for artists, novelists, and poets of every kind and degree. John Greenleaf Whittier is a poet who deserves to be better known in England for his 'Songs of Labour,' 'Home Ballads,' and 'Voices of Freedom.' He is doubtless a mild poet; but mild poetry, like mild air, mild weather, and a mild climate, has its charm. Let no one think that genius is absent from smooth and faultless versification. It may not indeed be genius of the highest order, yet without genius metric melody can never be produced. A critic of some ability has said 'This power over verse, as it is one of the most primary, so also do we regard it as one of the most final tests of a true poetic vocation. . . . other powers may be preferred for dignity or value; none is more of the essence of the art of poetry, or so positively discriminates that from all other forms of art. None, therefore, is more essential the poet, or more symptomatic of his rank.' Metric melody, also, seldom stands alone; the very power which produced it is a guarantee for the possession of other cognate powers; and hence we find that, in almost all cases, the melody of a composition is the measure of its ideas and images also. There is another piece by Whittier well known among us in consequence of its being so often recited at Penny Readings and such-like entertainments. It is 'Maud Miller,' she who\u2014</p><p>On a summer's day,<br>Raked the meadow sweet with hay.<br>Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth<br>Of simple beauty and rustic health.<br>Singing she wrought, and her merry glee<br>The mock-bird echoed from his tree.</p><p>Well; it is a simple tale\u2014a mere nothing to tell\u2014but very beautiful and very touching. A judge rides by; he draws his bridle in the shade of the apple-trees, and asks for a drink of water from the spring at the hands of Maud Miller. And she thinks and she sighs, and sighs and thinks how she should like to be a judge's wife; and the judge, riding away, thinks and dreams, and dreams and thinks how he should like to quit the dusty purlieus of the law, and exchange the weary fencing of stifling courts for the</p><p>Low of cattle and song of birds<br>And health, and quiet, and loving words.</p><p>But the judge marries a wife of rich dowry, who lives for fashion, as he lives for power. But often his thoughts revert to the vision of the barefoot maiden raking her hay; and Maud Muller's musings no less often turn on the rider who thanked her so graciously for the cooling draught, and talked so kindly of the hay and the weather,</p><p>the grass and flowers and trees,<br>Of the singing birds and the humming bees.</p><p>Now mark the conclusion, which for delicacy of touch may match with the workmanship of any master-hand.</p><p>Alas for maiden, alas for judge,<br>For rich repiner and household drudge!<br>God pity them both, and pity us all,<br>Who vainly the dreams of youth recall:<br>For all of sad words of tongue and pen,<br>The saddest are these\u2014'It might have been!'<br>Ah well! <em>for us all some sweet home lies<br>Deeply buried from human eyes;<br>And in the hereafter, angels may<br>Roll the stone from its grave away!</em></p><p>It is better to analyze one poem than to make general remarks on a dozen. The 'Brother of Mercy' exhibits Whittier's peculiar style and distinctive merits in a brief compass. A porter by the Pitti wall in the Val d' Arno is lying on his mat, about to die, while a barefoot monk of La Certosa sits at his side. A Brotherhood of Mercy, in their black masks, is seen moving in that direction, and Piero Luca, the porter, laments that, for the first time their bell has sounded during forty years, he is unable to join in their merciful task. He loved the work, he says; it was its own reward. He did not count on it as an offset against his sings, or as lessening his debt to the free grace and mercy of his Lord. The monk endeavours to console him with the prospect of eternal rest, the white robe and the golden crown. But Piero tosses on his sick pillow, and says in the most na\u00efve humility and, if we may say so, hallowed misconception of the heavenly world\u2014</p><p>Miserable me!<br>I am too poor for such grand company;<br>The grown would be too heavy for this grey<br>Old head; and, God forgive me if I say,<br>It was hard to sit there night and day<br>Like an image in the Tribune, doing nought<br>With these hands that all my life have wrought<br>Not for bread only, but for pity's sake.<br>I'm dull at prayers: I could not keep awake<br>Counting my beads. Mine's but a crazy head,<br>Scarce worth the saving if all else be dead.<br>And if one goes to heaven without a heart,<br>God knows he leaves his behind his better part.<br>I love my fellow-men: the worst I know<br>I would do good to. Will death change me so<br>That I shall sit among the lazy saints,<br>Turning a deaf ear to the sore complaints<br>Of souls that suffer? Why, I never yet<br>Left a poor dog in the strada hard beset,<br>Or ass o'erladen! must I rate man less<br>Than dog or ass, in holy selfishness?<br>Methinks (Lord, pardon, if the thought be sin!)<br>The world of pain were better, if therin<br>One's heart might still be human, and desires<br>Of natural pity drop upon its fires<br>Some cooling tears.</p><p>The perceptions of the poor monk reach no further than those of the poor dying porter. He thinks Piero's words profane; he crosses himself; cries 'Madman! thou art lost!' and flies with the pyx in his hands. The conclusion cannot be told better than in the writer's own words:\u2014</p><p>The sick man closed his eyes with a great groan<br>That sank into a prayer\u2014'Thy will be done!'<br>Then he was made aware, by soul or ear,<br>Of somewhat pure and holy bending o'er him,<br>And of a voice like that of her who bore him,<br>Tender and most compassionate: 'Be of cheer!<br>For heaven is love, as God himself is love:<br>Thy work below shall be thy work above.'<br>And when he looked, lo! In the stern monk's place<br>He saw the shining of an angel's face!</p><p>One cannot, of course, fail to see with regret that the god man who wrote this beautiful poetry indulged a perverse animus against the Catholic religion. He might have portrayed the character of Piero equally well without making the monk so stupid as to mistake the dying man's spiritual condition, and so harsh and unjust as to withdraw the last sacrament; for 'he took up his pyx and fled.' That the humble porter should outwit the priest, ad that the angel's face should shine where the monk's was stern, is a transparent Protestant trick. It will suit a large majority of American readers, perhaps of English too, but this is a poor criterion of merit. Il y a parier, says a French writer, que toute id\u00e9e publique, toute convention re\u00e7ue, est une sottise, car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.</p><p>The life of Edgar Allen Poe is a melancholy one\u2014the record of a wandering star\u2014of life, genius, happiness, and usefulness marred by the one degrading vice of intoxication, to which he owed his untimely end. With an acute ear for the music of verse, and a keen sense of the beautiful, he wove the chains of earthy passion round the wings of his soul, and dragged her into the dust of death. He might have used the words of the Bishop of Hippo in the 'Confessions,' and have said:\u2014 'Amabam pulchra inferiora et ibam in profundum, et dicebam amicis meis: Num amamus aliquid nisi pulchrum?' Five-and-twenty years have passed away since he expired in a hospital at Baltimore at the age of thirty-eight. He who had himself asked in the 'Black Cat,' 'What disease is like Alcohol? ' died of delirium tremens, yet he still lives in the poems which he wrote, as he himself assures us, without a purpose, because they have each a music inseparable from the sentiment they breathe, and a finish due to consummate taste. 'He had,' says one of his critics, 'an exquisite eye for proportion, and every little poem is carved like a cameo.'</p><p>The misfortunes of many other children of song met in Edgar Allen Poe. Like Bryon, he was a spoilt child, and, like that noble poet also, he lampooned his patron. Like Shelly, he was expelled from his University. Like Sheridan, he married a girl without dowry, like Burns he caroused, and like Savage, he ate in misery the bitter fruits of dissipation. He was as precocious as precocious as Chatterton; and among his misfortunes may be numbered that of having published a volume of poems while still a boy. The strength of wing expended in such premature flights would be turned to better account if reserved to a later day. The rise and growth of youghful vanity would be checked, and more correct taste cultivated for higher efforts. Poe's early effusions, however, were fully of promise, and Mr. James Hannay dwells with enthusiasm on one in particular, entitled 'Helen.' 'Could anything,' he asks, 'be more dainty, airy, amber-bright than this is?' Its elegance is Horatian. It is merum nectar, as Scaliger says of the Ode to Pyrrha.' Yet this poem is said to have been written at fourteen. His playful sonnet 'To Science' may be quoted as a specimen of his youthful faculties. It sins against the laws of the sonnet in its structure, but the expression is graceful, especially in the concluding line.</p><p>Science, true daughter of old Time thou art,<br>Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.<br>Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,<br>Vulture, whose wings are dull realites?<br>How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise?<br>Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering,<br>To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,<br>Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?<br>Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,<br>And driven the Hamadyrad from the wood<br>To seek a shelter in some happier star?<br>Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,<br>The Elfin from the green grass, and from me<br>The summer dream beneath the tarmarind-tree?</p><p>With all his faults, it is to Poe's credit that he has not transferred the irregularities of his life into his verses in any offensive and immodest way. They are like wild flowers, and for the most part, they breathe sweetly. In one, and in one only, we even catch a glimpse of an aspiration after the highest created Beauty in the person of the blessed Mother of our Lord; but we can draw from it no grave conclusion, so incongruous does it seem with the sparking levities in the midst of which it is found, and which moralize too plainly, and say:\u2014</p><p>Alas! his young affections run to waste<br>Or water but the desert.</p><p>The 'Hymn' is as follows, and it is so devoid of poetic merit, that the writer could hardly have thought it worth preserving except as a record of something which God had done for his soul. Yet we cannot be sure even of this much, for in the midst of his orgies he was always conversing with spirits, and pitying beautiful angels seemed, to his disordered fancy, to spread their wings over the living ruins of his soul and body.</p><p>At morn, at noon, at twilight dim,<br>Maria, though has heard my hymn:<br>In joy and woe, in good and ill,<br>Mother of God, be with me still!<br>When the hours flew brightly by,<br>And not a cloud obsured the sky,<br>My soul, lest it should truant be,<br>Thy grace did guide to Thine and thee.<br>Now, when storms of fate o'ercast<br>Darkly my Present and my Past,<br>Let my Future radiant shine<br>With sweet hopes of thee and Thine!</p><p>If he had felt this intensely, he would probably have expressed it in finer poetry, and have applied to it that melodious system of repetition and refrain of which he was a master and the inventor. Tennyson and Swinburne have often imitated his recurrent music, and though this is frequently nothing more than a poetic trick, there are cases in which it admirably expresses genuine and deep feeling. It is on the 'Raven' that Poe's reputation is mainly founded. It was received in the United States with rapturous applause, and the author himself was so intoxicated with vanity as to pronounce it the best poem that ever had been or would be written! It is beyond doubt a masterpiece of versification, and the delight of Music Halls and Assembly Rooms when recited by readers such as Fanny Kemble and Mr. Montesquieu Bellew. It is highly characteristic of Poe when Poe is at his best, yet it is surprising rather than great. 'It may be described,' Lady Pollock says, 'as the remorseful shriek of a troubled conscience; it projects strange phantoms, it is a startling representation of a special form of delirium in a diseased mind, and its peculiarities of rhyme and rhythm force it upon the attention . . . . . . It has more of spasm than of true vitality; but it is not altogether devoid of beauty. Its tricks of manner recommend it to vulgar tastes, and having enjoyed an immense immediate popularity, it is likely to be rated much lower a few years hence than it is now. Already it has sunk below the first estimate formed of it.' The author was indeed poetic rather than a poet. He looked on Life and Nature with a poet's eye, and he encircled himself wherever he went with gorgeous images and smooth cadenzas. Yet with the exception of the 'Raven,' 'Lenore,' and the 'Bells,' he has written sacredly anything that will long defy the rust of time. We cannot do more at present than ring one of his own changes on the 'Bells.'</p><p>Hear the sledges with the bells\u2014<br>Silver bells!<br>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!<br>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle<br>In the icy air of night!<br>White the stars that oversprinkle<br>All the heavens, seem to twinkle<br>With a crystalline delight;<br>Keeping time, time, time<br>In a sort of Runic rhyme,<br>To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells<br>From the bells, bells, bells, bells,<br>Bells, bells, bells,<br>From the jingling and the tingling of the bells.</p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, now upwards of seventy years of age, was the son of a Unitarian minister, and at one time discharged the like office with his father in Boston, his native city. The charms of literature, however, and of a literary career, withdrew him from the pulpit at an early period of life, and led him to devote all his time and attention to pursuits congenial to his taste. Brighter talents and keener sensibilities than his have seldom been united; but, although they have made him a most successful writer of prose, they have not sufficed to make him a popular or even an agreeable poet. We read his best pieces with an uneasy feeling, and it seems as if the author had composed them with effort and under restraint. Yet, speaking artistically, they are full of truth and beauty. They are poetry, and being such, we can sometimes hardly account for their giving so little pleasure. They rise and fly above the common level; but they lack sunlight on their joyful way, and freedom on their wings. They have no sustained flight. They do not move like Virgil's Dove, who\u2014</p><p>A\u00ebre lapsa quieto,<br>Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.</p><p>They limp, and halt, and start, and leap, and fairly tumble; then mount and play fantastic tricks, sparkle with a sudden fire, and as suddenly are lost in mist. No one can read the forty pages which 'May Day' fills withough feeling convinced that it brings together more lovely images of Spring than were probably ever before collected into so small a compass:\u2014</p><p>The million-handed sculpture moulds<br>Quaintest bud and blossom folds<br>The million-handed painter pours<br>Opal hues and purple dye;<br>Azaleas flush the island floors,<br>And the tints of heaven reply.</p><p>Yet the effect on the whole is not pleasing. Bewildered with a multitude of beautiful objects, we ask for the genius which can reduce them to order, and give them significancy. Seven-syllable lines, moreover, are too jingling to satisfy the ear except in brief lyrics. No amount of exquisite fragments will produce a whole without an adequate design. All Emerson's poems are fragments, and these again are fragmentary. His disjecta membra wants a uniting idea. What are oases of surpassing beauty, if severed from each other by sands, and brushwood, and swamp? Of all he has written in verse the 'Poet' and the 'Humble Bee' are the least open to this censure. There we find a store of poetic ideality, the finest perception, and a way of expressing things truly original. If he only had a true system in his head, he would be a glorious poet in spite of artistic defects. But he has one. He has all his life been striving to elaborate one, and he has not succeeded. An oppressive vagueness and insufficiency pervades his verse, because he is ever teaching what he has not learned. He would be an apostle of truth, and he knows not what truth is. Beauty, that is created beauty, he knows and loves. He has been from his youth</p><p>. . . . A forest seer<br>Minstrel of the natural year,<br>Foreteller of the vernal ides,<br>Wise harbinger of spheres and tides;<br>A lover true, who knew by heart<br>Each joy the mountain-dales impart:<br>It seemed that Nature could not raise<br>A plant in any secret place,<br>In quaking bog, on snowy hill,<br>Beneath the grass that shades the rill,<br>Under the snow, beneath the rocks,<br>In damp field known to bird and fox,<br>But he would come in the very hour<br>It opened in its virgin bower,<br>And tell its long-descended race.<br>It seemed as if the breezes brought him,<br>It seemed although the sparrows taught him,<br>As if by secret sight he knew<br>Where in far fields the orchis grew<br>Many events are in the field<br>Which are not shown to common eyes,<br>But all her shows did Nature yield<br>To please and win this pilgrim wise.<br>He saw the partridge drum in the woods,<br>He heard the woodcock's evening hymn,<br>He found the tawny thrush's broods,<br>And the shy hawk did wait for him.<br>What others did at distance hear,<br>And guessed within the thicket's gloom,<br>Was shown to the philosopher,<br>And at his bidding seemed to come.</p><p>Almost all the requirements of poetry are fulfilled in these suggestive lines; but it is not often that we find in his verse a long passage so well sustained, so delicate and perspicuous. Thirty-five years have passed since public attention was called to the strangely perplexed system of thought which he had to propound. It was on a Sunday evening in July, 1838, that he delivered an address to a senior class in Divinity College, Cambridge, and discussed from the most transcendental point of view the questions of man in his relations to the universe; of Christ and Christianity; the actual state of religion, and similar lofty themes. He developed in his lecture what some termed a 'Sublime Creed,' and others described as an 'Idealistic Pantheism.' It was, in fact, like many of his subsequent works, a rifacimento of the speculations of Carlyle and Coleridge, hard to be understood, and strongly spiced with the transcendentalism of Germany. A definite creed only can support a solid superstructure of verse. The mythology of ancient Greece and Rome had a certain grandeur, artistically considered, because it was at least definite, and the same may be said of Protestant poetry, so far as it retains the fundamental doctrines of the Faith; but when a poets brains are addled by the pantheistic doctrines of Hegel, Schelling, Fichte, and Jean Paul, his verses are inevitably marked by feebleness and obscurity. This it is which mars the music of many a mighty master of German song, and often makes their hymns and aspirations like sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And this leads us to observe another fatal blemish which Emerson has in common with many writers of the Victor Hugo stamp. He insults the majesty of the Son of God by extolling Him as a man, by placing Him in the list of heroes and sages, side by side with reformers and legislators, 'kings and saviours' of high repute. Thus in his 'Song of Nature' he speaks of</p><p>One in a Jud\u00e6an manger, [Christ]<br>And one by Avon stream, [Shakspeare]<br>One over against the mouths of Nile, [Saul of Tarsus]<br>And one in the Academe. [Plato]</p><p>And so again in one of those quatrains in which he was fond of completing a thought, in imitation of Goethe and Schiller:\u2014</p><p>I see all human wits<br>Are measured but a few,<br>Unmeasured still my Shakspeare sits,<br>Lone as <em>the blessed Jew.</em></p><p>'Hans Breitmann's Ballads,' by Charles G. Leland, are one of the many offshoots of Lowell's 'Biglow Papers.' They have imported, however, a new element into the composition of American humorous poetry. The hero, Hans Breitmann, is a native of Germany, and has not been long in the United States. His language, therefore, is a ludicrous mixture of two others, easily amalgamated, because of kindred origin. De Quincey informs us that 'the absurdissimo proposalio' of making English more musical by introducing Italian forms and terminations, 'met with no encouraggimento whaterino;' but he would not have said as much of an alliance between English and German if he could have read Hans Breitmann. There is a coarseness in these poems which will often be offensive to a refined English taste; but in sly satire and broad fun it would be difficult to find anything to surpass them. The bad spelling, the German pronunciation of English, and the admixture of German words, are not mere tricks; there is, besides all this, a substratum throughout of genuine humour. The author's keen sense of the ludicrous is contagious, and he who does not laugh over Hans Breitmann's abandon has no laughter in him. He would be proof against Moli\u00e8re, and Liston could not have disturbed his gravity. The dash of sentiment\u2014and German sentiment too, vague as a mist smitten with a sunbeam\u2014that Hans often throws into his merriest strain is as perfectly amusing as the most patient jokes:\u2014</p><p>Hans Breitmann gife a barty\u2014<br>Vhere ish dat barty now?<br>Vhere ish de lofely golden cloud<br>Dat float on de moundain's prow?</p><p>Vhere ish de himmelstrahlende stern\u2014<br>De shtar of de shpirit's light?<br>All goned afay mit de lager beer,<br>Afay in de ewigkeit.</p><p>Can anything represent more exactly the way in which Germans too often make sentiment take the place of virtue, and principle, in their words and writings, flies of in moonlit effervescence?</p><p>In the 'Philosopede,' again, we have a most facetious skit on the nineteenth-century-men, each of whom strides his bicycle and out runs everybody if he can.</p><p>Herr Schnitzerl makes a philosopede,<br>Von of de puttyest kind,<br>It vent mitout a vheel in front,<br>And hadn't none pehind.<br>Von vheel vas in de mittel, dough,<br>And it vent as sure as ecks,<br>For he shtraddled on the axel dree,<br>Mit derv hell petween his lecks.</p><p>Of course, Shnitzerl and his philosopede came to grief\u2014a circumstance deplored with much pathos:\u2014</p><p><em>Oh, vot ish all dis eart'ly pliss?</em><br>Oh, vot is man's soocksess?<br><em>Oh, vot ish various kinds of dings,</em><br>And vot is hobbiness?<br>Ve find a pank-node in de shreedt,<br>Next dings der pank ish preak;<br>Ve folls, and knocks our outsides in,<br>Vhen ve a ten shrike make.</p><p>So vos it mit der Schnitzerlien<br>On his philosophede,<br>His feet both shlipped outside-vard, shoost<br>Vhen at his exdra shpeed.<br>He felled open der vheel, of coorse;<br>De vheel like blitzen flew!<br>And Schnitzerl he vos schnitz in vact,<br>For it shlished him grod in two.</p><p>Und as for his phiosopede<br>Id cot so shkared, men say,<br>It pounded onward till it vent<br>Ganz tyfelwards afay.<br><em>Boot vhere ish now der Schitzerl's soul?</em><br>Vhere dos his shbirit pide?<br><em>In Himmel droo de endless plue</em><br>It takes a medeor ride.</p><p>One of the editors of the Breitmann Ballads, in speaking of them has said, 'There are abysses under abysses of cryptic and concealed fun'; and it would be difficult to invent a higher commendation. The grotesque language in which they are clothed is not unreal. It is the droll broken English (quite distinct from the Pennsylvanian German) spoken by millions of uneducated or half-educated Germans in America, immigrants chiefly from Southern Germany. They roll on a variety of subjects, social and political, and lay bare many of the rascalities of United States politicians no less than many of the absurdities of German philosophers. Thus in a poem n which the superiority of Germans to all the rest of mankind is maintained, and in which we are told</p><p>Dat der Deutscher hafe efen more intellects dan he himself soopose,</p><p>the speaker frankly avows his inability to understand himself, and adds:\u2014</p><p>Ash der Hegel say of his system\u2014dat only von mans knew<br>Vot der tyfel id meant-und he couldn't tell\u2014und der Jean <br>Richter, too,<br>Who saidt: 'Gott knows I meant somedings vhen foorst dis <br>buch I writ,<br>Boot Gott only wise vot das buch means now\u2014for I haf <br>Forgotten it!'</p><p>Some slight knowledge of German is necessary in order to take in the wit of these Ballads and even their sense, but the editions published by Tr\u00fcbner & Co. are amply provided with glossaries. Mr. Charles G. Leland has just published 'Gaudeamus; Humorous Poems\u2014translated from the German of Joseph Victor Scheffel and others.' The translations are cleverly executed, but translated wit is always cumbrous. Even the 'Jobsiad' of Kort\u00fcm is heavy in Mr. Brook's English. The best of the pieces in 'Gaudeamus' are travesties of science, and some of them are occasionally rather coarse. The same may be said of the poems of Bret Harte, which have acquired a popularity in America and in this country far beyond what their merits justify. They are often not only vulgar but profane, and the only excuse for him is, that, having chosen to mould his characters out of the commonest and coarsest kind, he puts such language into their lips as becomes their origin. Sometimes he glazes the clay; paints tender pictures on it; adorns it with little gems of virture or feeling, all the more resplendent because set in a sordid frame. He finds, in short, noble qualities in the loest and roughest of the human race. He has the dry, quaint humour of Artemus Ward and Mark Twain, plus a Bret-Hartean pathos.</p><p>'That Heathen Chinee,' the famous cheater at Euchre, or the American \u00e9cart\u00e9, was Bret Harte's first and great success. There is, no doubt, a depth of humour in it which is very ingenioius, but the wit of Jim and Dow's Flat has too much dross mixed with it to be recommended or approved. Reading poetry used to be regarded as a recreation; it is now made a labour. Persons are now continually exhorted to read what they cannot understand, or what they find as difficult as a Sphinx's enigma. It is not enough that serious poetry, or as it is called, philosophical poetry, should be obscure, humorous verse as well is made as hard to work as a sum in the Binomial theorem. Bret Harte is not free from this algebraic kind of wit. Of course, he would complain of the dulness of his readers and critics. But readers are dull\u2014that is, very often;\u2014and critics\u2014well\u2014they are not impossible to please. When Bret Hare wills, he can be perspicuous enough, as in a fine song called the 'Reveille.' It is worthy of its name. It reminds us of B\u00fcrger and Beck, of Simrock, Mosen, Strackwitz, and Herwegh. Bret Harte can be clear even when witty, as in 'Penelope.' He can be almost pathetic, as in 'Fate,' and tenderly descriptive, as in the 'Seabird,' and the 'Mountain Heart's ease.' Here is a specimen of his best manner\u2014peculiar enough, thoughtful, and suggestive. A stranger elegy was never written; yet it scarcely requires a comment. The 'In Memoriam' explains itself,\u2014the 'Watchman of Ephriam,' as Osee says, 'was with my God.'</p><p><em>RELIEVING GUARD</em></p><p><em>T.S.K.\u2014Obiit March 4, 1864.</em><br>Came the Relief. 'What, sentry, ho!<br>How passed the night through thy long waking?'<br>'Cold, cheerless, dark,\u2014as may befit<br>The hour before the dawn is breaking.'</p><p>'No sight? no sound?' 'No; nothing save<br>The plover from the marshes calling,<br>And in yon Western sky, about<br>An hour ago, a Star was falling.'</p><p>'A Star? There's nothing strange in that.'<br>'No, nothing; but, above the thicket,<br>Somehow it seemed to me that God<br>Somewhere had just relieved a picket.'</p><p>It is now nearly twenty years since Walt Whitman's 'Blades of Grass' were first published, and as they have undoubtedly exercised a wide and lasting influence, notwithstanding their peculiar form, we feel bound to submit them to a careful analysis. Mr. William Michael Rossetti was principally concerned in introducing his works into the English market; and when it is remembered that Mr. Rossetti is the bosom friend of Swinburne, our readers will not be surprised to hear that Walt Whitman, as an author, is the embodiment of all that is most opposed to the Catholic religion. It is curious also to observe that Mr. Rossetti's first estimate and admiration of the works of this poet appeared in the Chronicle for July 6, 1867, under the article 'Walt Whitman's Poems.' In consequence of this article, as he himself informs us, he was requested to edit a selection from Whitman's writings. Happily these poems, or Ossianic effusions, fraught with the most dangerous principles, do not come before the world in an attractive shape. A certain rhythm runs through them, but they have no rhyme, except in a few instances, nor are they even in blank verse. They are far less poetic in form than the Psalms and Prophets in Hebrew, or Southey's 'Thalaba the Destroyer,' and may be regarded, as some one has said, 'as a warp of prose amid the weft of poetry.' Thus even in composition, they are but a mongrel breed\u2014a hybrid monstrosity. For this reason indeed, Walt Whitman has adopted his strange attire. It strikes the eye; it imposes by its novelty; it bespeaks the audacious personality of the man himself. He claims to be the man of the period\u2014the voice of Republican America. His claim is admitted by his admirers. He cannot be dealt with as a child or a fool. He is neither. He is the exponent of democracy; the champion of humanity; the nineteenth century incarnate. Man, individual and en masse, that is his theme. For him, evil has no existence, or if it exists, it is well that it should exist.</p><p>I am myself (he says) just as much evil as good, and my nation is\u2014and I <br>say there is in fact no evil,<br>Or, if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to me,<br> as anything else.(<em>Chants Democratic.</em>)</p><p>His grandfather was 'the great Quaker Iconoclast, Elias Hicks,' and as dispositions of mind and body are alike hereditary, we find in the grandson an Iconoclast of another type. Whitman's ambition is to break into pieces every sacred image and construct a theory of humanity entirely his own. That his enthusiasm is genuine may be inferred from the fact of his devoting himself to the care of the sick and wounded, in the field and in the hospitals, during the Civil War between the North and South. It is not, however, the less to be dreaded on that account. Benevolence and Atheism were combined in Shelley, and so are self-sacrifice and Materialism united in Walt Whitman. He was in advance of his time, as to his new doctrine, when he first wrote, and though his materialistic ideas have now become far more common, he is in some respects in advance of his time still. The day of his influence, therefore, is not over, for he is more logical than many of his fellows, and carries out their notions into results from which they themselves would perhaps recoil. He is come, this Auguste Comte in verse, this demolisher of all religion, to 'inaugurate a religion.' They are his own words.</p><p>. . . . The whole earth (he adds) and all the stars in the sky, are for <br>religion's sake.<br>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough;<br>None has ever yet adored or worshiped half enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the <br>future is.<br>I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be <br>their religion;<br>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;<br>Nor character, nor life worthy the name, without religion;<br>Nor land, nor man or woman, without religion.</p><p>There is vigour and power enough here, and truth too, if the words were interpreted in a right sense, but whether these long, wavy 'Leaves of Grass' deserve, as poetry, the praises lavished on them by Messrs. Emerson, Rossetti, and Swinburne, we leave to our readers to judge. It is more to our purpose to inquire what is the 'greater religion,' the germs of which Walt Whitman dropped into the earth. It is not, you may be sure, the Catholic religion, nor is it Christianity in any sense, though the Bible is one of the writer's favourite books. It is, as nearly as it may be described, the Religion of Humanity-the religion for which Mazzini fought with the pen and Garibaldi with the sword. You may infer what it is from a passage in the Preface to 'Leaves of Grass' written by the poet himself:\u2014</p><p>There will soon be no more priests. Their work is done. They may wait awhile\u2014perhaps a generation or two\u2014dropping off by degrees. A superior breed shall take their place\u2014the gangs of Kosmos and prophets en masse shall take their place. A new order shall arise and they shall be the priests of man, and every man shall be his own priest. The churches built under their umbrage shall be the churches of men and women. Through the divinity of themselves shall the Kosmos and the new breed of poets be interpreters of men and women and of all events and things. They shall find their inspiration in real objects today, symptoms of the past and future.</p><p>Though this passage is printed as prose, it is quite as much poetry as the 'Leaves of Grass.' It represents the ideas of Comte as developed in his 'Positive Religion.' Yet it must not be supposed that Walt Whitman is a plagiarist in any sense. He does not strictly follow Comte, Mazzini, Victor Hugo, Huxley, or Tyndall , though he may by accident agree with each of them in turn. His system, with its rotten basis, its hideous defects, and its strange admixture of the beautiful and the grand, is all his own. Materialist though he be, to such an extent as to make matter in general, and our bodies in particular divine, he is not a pure materialist; he teaches the immortality of the soul and the body, and in his poems, as by the bedside of the dying, he predicts with the confidence of faith the existence of the soul after death clothed in a finer frame of matter elaborated within us during our earthly life. This is, we believe, a doctrine of many Spiritualists; but Whitman is not properly a Spiritualist any more than a mere Materialist. When we consider the breadth of his system, and the multitude of beautiful truths he has incorporated into it, we cannot but deeply lament that, either through perversity or defective education, or both, he has not been intromitted into the glorious heritage of the Catholic faith, where he would find all that he now holds of good and true under the seal of the Blood of an Incarnate God, to the exclusion of all that he holds also which is earthly, sensual, and devilish. For him, as for Catholics, but under very different conditions, the air around is full of spirits released from their mortal coil. Yet with this and similarly sublime and consoling reflections, he associates occasionally passages and entire poems so corrupt in morals and so indecent in language that they are omitted in English editions of his works. With Whitman, the body is the soul, and the soul is the body; the corpse that we drop in the grave is 'excrementitious'; the real body survives:</p><p>Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and pass to <br>fitting spheres,<br>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment <br>of death</p><p>It is the soul-body of which he speaks, the magnetic or ethereal body, supposed by some to be formed and still forming within the grosser body which will die. If Whitman could be described in one word, we should call him a Universalist. He has no antagonisms. He accepts all, admires all, loves all. He would embrace all objects, material and spiritual, as if the grasp of his finite intellect were the underlying principle that welds things together, harmonizes all discords, annihilates all distinctions of good and evil, of pain and pleasure, of past and future, time and eternity:\u2014</p><p>I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;<br>I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god;<br>I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception;<br>I assert that all past days were what they should have been;<br>And that they could no-how have been better than they were,<br>And that to-day is what it should be\u2014and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than they are.</p><p>If in this place we were discussing systems of philosophy in the United States instead of poetry, it would be necessary to enter more fully into the subject of Walt Whitman's speculations. He is not a mere rhapsodist, nor can he be dismissed as a dreamer or an imbecile. There is more bone and sinew in his pages than in those of any other American poet, and that mainly because his ideas are often new and always daring. But enough has been said here for the guidance of those who are curious about his school of thought, and we must make but one further remark on his character as a poet. Of all American poets he is the most intensely national, and in him the great Democracy of the West has found a man who, as Carlyle says, 'will speak forth melodiously what the heart of it means.' He has given scope to the gigantic ideas of his people, and to their unparalleled activity and progress in every social and scientific department. His verses, like his genius, are shaggy and unshorn, and they shake the land like a herd of buffaloes thundering over the prairie. Nothing more national than his 'American Feuillage,' 'Drum Taps,' and poems on the death of President Lincoln, was ever written; and deeply as we deplore the erratic path into which his eager mind has wandered, we cannot but recognize in his talents a gift of the Most High, and in his writings much that is beautiful and precious in the midst of much that is dangerous and base. Any study of American poetry which did not embrace his works would be imperfect, because he has given it a direction in the line of original and powerful thought. If the Catholic religion should spread more widely in the United States, and obtain a firmer hold, directly or indirectly over the public mind, the divine alchemy of which they are possessed who 'have the unction from the holy One and know all things' might turn much of his alloyed metal into refined gold. Fresh and athletic poetry was what, before Whitman's time, America wanted; and now that the want has in some degree, and under great disadvantage, been supplied, it only remains to impart to the new importation that religious and Christian character which made Dante and Milton rulers in the realms of mind. It is, doubtless, by permission of the All-Wise that poets as well as professors, in America as in England, are ranging themselves with new energy in the ranks of unbelief; but it will be, as ever, the sublime office of the Catholic Church to strike the weapons from their hands, to enrich herself with their spoils, and to yoke them to the triumphant car of him who cometh with dyed garments from Bosra.</p><p>Having said this much of Walt Whitman's compositions, and believing, as we do, that in matter of poetry they represent the American mind and the state of American society more faithfully than any other poems\u2014shadowing forth with a certain wild magnificence the rapid, gigantic, and terrible growth of principles false and true\u2014we ought perhaps to give a further specimen of the strange long sweep and Hebraic recurrences in the verse of this thorough Yankee:\u2014</p><p>Why! who makes much of a miracle?<br>As to me, <em>I know of nothing else but miracles,</em><br>Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan [New York],<br>Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,<br>Or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water,<br>Or stand under trees in the woods,<br>Or talk by day with any one I love,<br>Or sit at table at dinner with my mother,<br>Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,<br>Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,<br>Or animals feeding in the fields,<br>Or birds\u2014or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,<br>Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down\u2014or of stars shining so quiet and <br>bright,<br>Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;<br>Or whether I go among <em>those I like best, and that like me best\u2014mechanics,<br>boatmen, farmers,</em><br>Or among the savans\u2014or to the soir\u00e9e\u2014or to the opera,<br>Or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,<br>Or behold children at their sports,<br>Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,<br>Or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,<br>Or my own eyes and figure in the glass;<br>These, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,<br>The whole referring\u2014yet each distinct, and in its place.<br>To me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,<br>Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,<br>Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,<br>Every foot of the interior swarms with the same;<br>Every spear of grass\u2014the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women,<br> and all that concerns them,<br>All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles.<br>To me the sea is a continual miracle;<br>The fishes that swim\u2014the rocks\u2014the motion of the waves\u2014the ships, with <br>men in them,<br>What stranger miracles are there?</p><p>In America, as in England, the great poet is still to arise. It is essential that he should be a Catholic\u2014'a poet,' as Emanuel Geibel says, 'by the grace of God' (Poet von Gottes Gnaden). Not that Catholicism need be his subject, but it should underlie it, and circumscribe it, and hold it in solution. He should see all things from a Catholic point of view, yet see more than most who are round about him, and see farther than his age in general. He should have the versatility of Shakspeare, the might of Milton, the faith of Dante, and the perfect language of Tennyson. He should embrace, so far as one man can embrace, all sciences, have the liveliest affinity for the true and the beautiful, wherever found, and the tenderest sympathy with human suffering. He should pierce to the principles underlying facts and binding together disjointed phenomena. He should be as orthodox as the see of S. Peter, yet discern in every error its basis or contingent of truth. He should leave his moral lessons to be inferred, and remember that, for the most part, the mission of the poet is to please rather than to teach. Relying with full confidence on the all-embracing character of his divine religion, he should avoid as a pestilence every species of narrowness, and be content to be often misinterpreted and misunderstood. Originality in a poet is impossible if he be always writing down to the level of inferior understandings. He must be judged by the few, that he may delight the many; and in saying this, we do not for a moment forget that simplicity, directness, perspicuity are the crowning glory of all composition, and especially of poetry. Never before, in the history of mankind, were the materials at a poet's command so rich and varied as they are now. All things are assuming giant proportions\u2014commerce, locomotion, social questions, politics, education, war, sciences, arts. Nature was never observed before as she is now observed, and the novelist's art has laid bare the human heart and depicted the characters of men in such vivid and varied colours as we never saw till of late. Religion itself\u2014our own holy religion\u2014has developed within the present generation, and presented itself to us in a more definite and extended shape than ever. The times are ripe for great poetry and a great minstrel of mankind. Man, the Kosmos, the Bible, the infallible Church, Time, Futurity\u2014what themes! The mere mention of them is inspiring; for what is poetry but the highest truth and the deepest emotion? Express them as you will, there is music in the sound and rhythm in the language. Where will this poet of the future, who makes Catholicism his standpoint, arise? Will England or America have the honour of giving him birth?</p>", "date": "July 1874", "year": 1874, "creator": "John Charles Earle", "publication": "The Dublin Review", "citation": "Earle, John Charles [unsigned in original]. \"American Poets [Part 2].\" July 1874.

Whitman, it may be explained, is an American writer who some years back attracted attention by a volume of so-called poems which were chiefly remarkable for their absurd extravagance and shameless obscenity, and who has since, we are glad to say, been little heard of among decent people. It now appears that, although there is a small coterie of persons in this country who are not ashamed to confess their liking for Whitman's nastiness, his own countrymen have universally repudiated him. 'The real truth,' says an American journal, which has taken up the subject apparently in the interest of Whitman, 'is that, with the exception of a very few readers, Whitman's poems in their public reception have fallen still-born in this country. They have been met, and are met to-day, with the determined denial, disgust, and scorn of orthodox American authors, publishers, and editors, and in a pecuniary and worldly sense have certainly wrecked the life of their author.' 'No established publishing house will publish his books. Most of the stores will not even sell them.' 'Repeated attempts to secure a small income by writing for the magazines during his illness have been utter failures. The Atlantic will not touch him. His offerings to Scribner are returned with insulting notes; the Galaxy the same. Harper's did print a couple of his pieces two years ago, but imperative orders from head-quarters have stopped anything further. All the established American poets studiously ignore Whitman.' We are of course sorry that Whitman, or any other man, should be in sore distress, but we must say that we are very glad indeed to hear that his writings are unsaleable, and that no respectable publisher or editor in America will give him countenance by printing his contributions. This fact, if it is true, shows that the moral sense of the American public is, after all, not quite so much deadened as some recent events might lead one to imagine. If the New York Herald will not have anything to do with Walt Whitman, it is a proof that even the Herald draws the line somewhere. We can only regret that the same view is not taken by all publishers on this side of the ocean, and that there is one firm at least in London which is not ashamed to advertise a 'complete' edition of Whitman's works. We have no desire to pry into details of Whitman's private life. The description which he gives of himself in his writings as 'disorderly, fleshly, sensual,' and fond of loafing, is not perhaps to be taken in a literal sense; and in any case we have no desire to speculate as to how far his private life may have been imprudent or irregular. The important fact is that he has found it impossible to get a living by his writings, which are everywhere shunned and rejected. Considering the character of these writings, this seems to us a very natural and desirable result, and it is difficult to understand why people should be expected to buy an article which disgusts them. Some of Mr. Whitman's friends and admirers in London have, however, worked themselves into a state of theatrical indignation with regard to the treatment of this great man by his unappreciative and ungrateful countrymen. Mr. Robert Buchanan, who has made himself the mouthpiece of this extraordinary agitation, not only claims for Whitman 'literary immortality,' but exalts his 'ineffable goodness' and 'beneficence,' and declares, in a passage flavoured with a touch of blasphemy which we prefer not to quote, that 'only this last consecration of Martyrdom was wanting to complete our poet's apotheosis.' Mr. Buchanan, being himself a poet, naturally chafes against the restraints of ordinary prose, and we are treated to a wonderful picture, in the highest style of fine language, of a 'golden eagle sick to death, worn with age and famine, or with both, passing with weary waft of wing from promontory to promontory, from peak to peak, pursued by a crowd of prosperous rooks and crows, who fall screaming back whenever the noble bird turns his indignant head, and which follow frantically once more, hooting behind him, whenever he ascends their way.' This is all very fine no doubt in its way, but it may be thought to be hardly a fair description of the case of a dirty bird which is shunned on account of its unclean habits. Mr. Buchanan also breaks out into furious vituperation against all American publishers and men of letters, whom he abuses in the most vulgar terms; and warns the American nation collectively that its 'honour will be tarnished eternally by the murder of its only remaining prophet.' Mr. Buchanan concludes by what is really an insulting appeal to his own countrymen, as 'loving and revering' this apostle of beastliness, to give him 'a substantial proof of the honour in which he is held here in the heart of England.'</p><p>From the height of this rhapsodical outburst it is a sad descent to the prosaic facts of the case. It is of course open to any one who admires, or is simply sorry for, Whitman to subscribe for his support; but it is difficult to understand why those who dislike his flagrant indecencies should be denounced because they do not feel inclined to give him any encouragement. Mr. Buchanan himself, though he does not scruple to rank Whitman with the Saviour, and declares that his teaching is 'as heavenly manna,' thinks it necessary to 'disclaim entire sympathy with Whitman's materialistic idealism, which seems to go too far in the direction of illuminating the execrable.' Mr. Buchanan does not explain exactly what he means by 'execrable,' but in any sense such an admission goes far to justify the distrust and loathing with which Whitman is regarded both here and in America. Mr. Buchanan holds that 'these great experiments in poetry' are 'destined to exercise an extraordinary influence on the future of religion as well as poetry,' and this, he says, 'no one who has read his works will deny.' Public opinion, however, both here and in America, has expressed itself very decisively as to these great experiments; and there is very little chance of Mr. Buchanan or any of his associates bringing the world round to a different view. It is no doubt true that there are many people who have never read Whitman's so-called poetry all through, but enough is known to show that it is an attempt to make animal brutality and indecency pass for poetry. No doubt the present effort to revive curiosity on the subject will be a useful advertisement to any bookseller who happens to have a stock of Whitman's garbage on hand. It must be remembered, however, that his earlier works have been before the public for some twenty years, and that during the whole of that time the opinion originally formed of them has been steadily sustained, and, if possible, intensified; and there is, we imagine, very little danger of this judgment being now reversed by friendly puffery and agitation, even when such great authorities as Mr. Buchanan supposes himself to be take up the matter. There are, no doubt, questions both of art and philosophy on which public opinion at times goes astray; but in the present instance the elementary instincts of mankind are sufficient to settle the question. There would indeed need to be a very remarkable change both in the moral and intellectual constitution of educated people before such writings as those of Whitman could be accepted as, in any sense, honest literature.</p><p>When Mr. Buchanan screeches about 'literary outlawry,' 'murder,' 'official persecution,' he is obviously only talking nonsense. We have no desire to say anything in disparagement of American publishers, but they are no doubt not absolutely exempt from the weaknesses of other tradesmen; and we suspect that, if there really were a market anywhere for Whitman's wares, he would have no difficulty in finding some one to retail them for him. It is reasonable to assume that American publishers and editors know their own business, and that they have sufficient reasons for having nothing to do with Mr. Whitman. He has chosen to identify himself with unsavoury things, and whatever he might now write, his name would be a taint to any respectable periodical. The fact is that it was only the indecent exposure which Whitman made of himself in the first instance that attracted passing attention to him as a sort of psychological monstrosity. Apart from his scandalous eccentricities, his writings are poor stuff, and the affectation of deep philosophy is easily seen through. The assumption that a man who sets himself to outrage public decency should be gratefully supported by public charity is certainly a very curious one. Mr. Buchanan asserts that his idol has many worshippers in this country, but we venture to say that this is a part of his delusion; and we may add that those who are so unfortunate in their tastes as to belong to this sect would perhaps act prudently for themselves in not proclaiming it too loudly. The conclusion would seem to be that the 'illumination of the execrable' is not a remunerative business; and so far the lesson is a useful one, and may be taken to heart by any other writers who have a weakness that way. There is also, however, a general principle underlying Mr. Buchanan's letter which deserves notice. He appears to imagine that society is bound, as a matter of course, to contribute to the maintenance of any one who chooses to set up as a man of genius. The genius may be less apparent than some other characteristics, but society is bound all the same to accept implicitly the claimant's own assurance, and that of a few sympathetic friends, that he is a genius, and to provide for him accordingly. This, we fancy, is a favourite idea with a certain class of poets, who have usually reasons of their own for holding that their incomes ought not to be dependent merely on the popularity of their works and the respect in which they are held by those who know them. Instances can no doubt be mentioned of great poets who were not sufficiently appreciated while alive; but, on the other hand, it would be rather hazardous to undertake to provide for every one who, believing himself to be a poet, could not get a living by his works. We should then have a fine flock of hard-up 'golden eagles' eager to take advantage or public charity. If the appeal on behalf of Whitman were based simply on his age and indigence, we should not think ourselves bound to say anything against it. But the plan proposed is to help him circulate his writings, and thus implies approval of them. It is satisfactory to believe that agitation for such a purpose is likely to prove as futile as it is audacious.</p>", "date": "March 18 1876", "year": 1876, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The Saturday Review", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman.\" 18 March 1876.

Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person By JOHN BURROUGHS. New York, 1871.</p><p>5. Walt Whitman By R. M. BUCKE, M.D. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>IN a letter dated Concord, 6th May, 1856, Emerson wrote to Carlyle:\u2014'One book, last summer, came out in New York, a nondescript monster which yet has terrible eyes and buffalo strength, and was indisputably American, which I thought to send you, but the book throve so badly with the few to whom I shewed it, and wanted good morals so much, that I never dxml:id. Yet I believe now again I shall. It is called Leaves of Grass, was written and printed by a journeyman printer in Brooklyn, New York, named Walter Whitman; and after you have looked into it, if you think, as you may, that it is only an auctioneer's inventory, you can light your pipe with it.'</p><p>The book referred to was a copy of the singular looking thin quarto volume of little more than a hundred pages, in which the Leaves of Grass originally appeared, and which is now so eagerly sought after by American book-collectors. What Carlyle's opinion of it was, whether, as Emerson thought he might, he used it for the purpose of lighting his pipe, or like Emerson, he held it in high esteem for its intrinsic excellence, we have no means of knowing. In the recently published Carlyle-Emerson correspondence there is no further reference to it, and so far as we can remember, no allusion is made to it in any of Carlyle's published writing.</p><p>The reception which this strange 'nondescript monster['] with 'terrible eyes and buffalo strength' met with at the hands of the public and in literary circles was almost as disheartening as possible. Of the thousand copies printed, some, Dr. Bucke informs us, were given away, most of them were lost, abandoned, or destroyed.\u2217 According to Mr. Burroughs, some sixty copies were deposited for sale in a bookseller's shop in Brooklyn, and as many more in another in New York. Weeks elapsed and not a single copy was sold. Presently there came the request from both the booksellers that the unfortunate thin quarto should be removed. Subsequently the copies found refuge in the warehouse of a phrenological publishing establishment in Broadway, the proprietors of which advertised the work, and sent out copies for review and to distinguished persons. 'The journals,' continues Mr. Burroughs, 'remained silent, and of the copies sent to distinguished persons several were returned with insulting notes. The only reception heard of, was such, for instance, as the use of the volume by the attaches of a leading daily paper in New York\u2014collected in a swarm Saturday afternoon, waiting to be paxml:id off\u2014as a butt and burlesque, whose perusal aloud by one of the party, the other lounging or standing about, was equivalent to peals upon peals of ironical laughter from the whole assemblage.\u2020 Cold as its reception by the press was, it was scarcely so silent, however, as Mr. Burroughs' words might lead the reader to suppose. As we learn from Dr. Bucke's extremely useful and handy little volume, it was noticed, though certainly in no very complimentary terms, in the Brooklyn Daily Times, in the London Critic, and in the New York Criterion. Nor was it altogether ignored in higher quarters. It had the honour of being reviewed in Putnam's Magazine, then the most influential and best conducted of the American periodicals. The reception given to it there was probably under the circumstances the best possible. The reviewer filled three columns with extracts from its pages, selecting the most original and striking passages, and passing over those which were calculated to offend, and though he pronounced the new poems to be a 'mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism,' which were here 'seen to combine in harmony,' and indulged in other pleasantries of a similar nature, he frankly acknowledged that there were to be found 'an original perception of nature, a manly temper, and an epic directness in the new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school.'</p><p>That any warmer or more encouraging reception should have been accorded to the book was scarcely to be expected. Its singular appearance, its peculiar lines, its utter want of conformity with most of the conventionalities of the poet's art, the obscurity of its author, and above all its seeming want of good morals were against it. Circumstances, however, soon conspired to lift both the volume and its author, if not out of derision, at least out of obscurity. The first and most weighty was the publication of a letter to Whitman from Emerson in which he declared the Leaves of Grass a 'wonderful gift,' and pronounced it 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' 'I give you joy,' he wrote with his usual cheeriness, 'of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things saxml:id incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.    .   .   .  The solxml:id sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Thoreau wrote of the book in a similar, if more guarded, strain. 'On the whole, it sounds to me,' were his words, 'very brave and American, after whatever deductions. I do not believe that all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in this land, put together, are equal to it for preaching. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He sometimes suggests something a little more than human.' By these and other means public attention was gradually directed to the volume: and when at length a new and enlarged edition appeared in 1856, it awoke a perfect storm of derision and abuse. Indeed, so extreme were the feelings it excited, that, according to Dr. Bucke, a number of persons in New York seriously contemplated instituting proceedings against its author in the courts of law, and were only deterred by the consxml:ideration that, whatever might be the estimation in which his book deserved to be held, Whitman himself was so popular in New York and Brooklyn that it would be impossible to get a jury to find him guilty. But the best piece of good luck that befell Whitman was his dismissal in 1865, by Mr. Harlan, formerly a Wesleyan clergyman, but at the time secretary for the Interior, from a government clerkship he had obtained, on the ground of the alleged immorality of Leaves of Grass. This act at once put the climax to the discussion as to his merits and demerits, and aroused an intense curiosity respecting his volume, and not a little sympathy in his favour.</p><p>On Whitman himself the derision and abuse, which were heaped upon him in true Philistine fashion, had, and have had, little or no permanent effect. Least of all, have they induced him to modify the principles with which he started on his literary career, which, as Emerson rightly divined, 'had a long foreground.' Having carefully settled his principles at the beginning, Whitman has steadily adhered to them, never doubting, and never having the slightest misgivings as to their soundness. Respecting the matter in which he has applied them\u2014a very different thing\u2014he has now and again had serious doubts.</p><p>'Since I have been ill,' he writes in a note to the Preface of 1876, 'I have felt temporary depression more than once, for fear that in Leaves of Grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced.' But in his clearest and calmest moods he has always realized, he tells us, that as the Leaves surely prepare the way for morals and necessitate them, and are adjusted to them just as nature does and is, so they are what, consistently with his plan, they must and should be. The scorn which he naturally felt towards his detractors was mainly of the silent sort. He neither sought to defend his reputation, nor to retaliate on those by whom it was so savagely assailed; nor dxml:id he care much whether he was understood or not. In a poem which does not seem to have been included in the earliest edition, and which is in some respects characteristic, he writes:\u2014</p><p>'I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or to be understood;<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise;<br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all),</p><p>'I exist as I am\u2014that is enough:<br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;<br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content;</p><p>'One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;<br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million <br>years,<br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p><p>'My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution;<br>And I know the amplitude of time.'</p><p>This bold and almost arrogant confxml:idence is now apparently being justified. Though not popular in the sense that he is wxml:idely read, or that his works are to be found, as Whittier's are saxml:id to be, in almost every house in the United States, Whitman has on the American continent a large and increasing circle of readers. Outsxml:ide of America his admirers are more numerous still. Like Fourier, he may be saxml:id to have his propagandists in many lands. On the continent of Europe some of his works have been translated into several languages, while in England, where his worth was early recognised, he has secured the warm, and on the whole judicious advocacy of poets and critics like Swinburne, Buchanan, W.B. Bell, W.M. Rossetti, Symonds, and Professor Dowden, and of his popularity amongst ourselves not the least significant sign is the publication of the two handsome volumes, the titles of which we have placed first at the head of this paper.</p><p>In these volumes is contained, it would appear, all that Whitman desires to be preserved of his published writings. The one bearing the title Specimen Days and Collect is, with the exception of one or two juvenile pieces, in prose, and as the title indicates, is of very varied contents. First of all, we have a number of pages in which Whitman gives an account\u2014an account, we may remark in passing, which is not without interest\u2014of his ancestry and early days. Next, we have a number of memoranda written during the war of attempted secession, and here copied verbatim from a series of 'soil'd and creas'd livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket,' and 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain,' having been 'hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom admit the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march.' The memoranda here given from these 'lurxml:id and blood-smutch'd little note-books' bear all the marks of their origin. They are written in swift, vigorous, telling words; while the intense realism by which they are pervaded, and the terrible scenes which they depict, often make their reading exceedingly impressive. Following these, and forming the concluding part of the Specimen Days, is a number of memoranda written during and after the author's recovery from a serious and prolonged illness, brought on by his exertions during the war, and consisting, for the most part, of descriptions of natural and human scenes. They are full of fine thought and feeling, and are frequently not less poetical than some of the finer passages in his poems. In the Collect are included the remarkable essay entitled 'Democratic Vistas,' the prefaces to the various issues of his poems, and a paper on 'American Poetry.'</p><p>Whitman's prose is, in our opinion, not equal to his verse. Passages of great beauty and power occur; but taken as a whole the style is less terse and vigorous. It is marred, too, by mannerisms, and particularly by the frequent occurrence of long and often clumsy parentheses. As a rule the shorter pieces are written in much sounder and healthier English than the longer, though some of these are admirably written, and lead one to suspect, as a not unfriendly critic has observed, 'that his every-day prose is distorted intentionally.' For a right understanding of Whitman's poetry, however, a careful study of his prose writings, and more especially of the section having the somewhat strange, though not all together inappropriate, designation of 'Collect,' is indispensable. It is here that he explains himself, and unfolds the aims and principles by which he is guxml:ided and inspired.</p><p>Leaves of Grass, originally, as we have remarked, a thin quarto of about a hundred pages, has now grown into a goodly sized octavo of nearly four hundred closely printed pages, containing close upon three hundred separate poems. Whitman has given regular titles to comparatively few of them. Most of them are headed instead with their first line or phrase, as, e.g. 'As I pondered in silence,' 'I hear America singing,' 'When I heard at the close of the day.' The greater part of them are distributed under the headings\u2014'Inscriptions,' 'Children of Adam,' 'Calamus,' 'Birds of Passage,' 'Sea-drift,' 'By the Roadsxml:ide,' 'Drum-taps,' 'Autumn Rivulets,' 'Whispers of Heavenly Death,' 'From Noon to Starry Eye,' 'Songs of Parting.' Unconnected as they seem, however, it must not be supposed that they have no connection or are without arrangement. Though without formal connection, they have one which is real, and are intended to be read in the order in which they stand, as what may not unfitly be called an Epic of Life. On first reading, as most readers will probably acknowledge, they are somewhat repellent. There is so much in them we do not expect to find, so little respect is paxml:id to our conventional xml:ideas, and the author obtrudes himself so ostentatiously upon our attention, that after a few lines, we are disposed to throw the book asxml:ide as a compound of egotism and nonsense. On further reading, however, the illusion is gradually dispelled. First the attention is arrested by single lines or isolated passages, and as we proceed we become aware of an intellectual wealth and suggestiveness, a subtle charm, a personal force, a rush and glow of overmastering passion which we have seldom met with elsewhere; and though there are passages from which we turn away with repugnance, we cease to wonder at the warm and extremely eulogistic terms in which the admirers of Whitman are in the habit of speaking of him.</p><p>But whatever our estimate of Whitman's writings may be, Whitman himself is unquestionably a notable figure, certainly one of the most notable America has produced. As Professor Dowden has remarked,\u2014'What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass, is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-word clay nor cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timxml:idly from behind his work to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am, a solxml:id and not inconsxml:iderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications; he attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love: or our extreme repugnance. However we feel toward him we cannot despise him. He is a 'summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be gotten rxml:id of. Passed by he cannot be.'\u2021 Nor are the sources of this singular power far to seek. They are to be found not so much in his art, for as an artist he is in some respects confessedly weak, but in the lofty purpose by which he is inspired, and in the ardent, and almost fierce enthusiasm with which he has from first to last devoted himself to it. This purpose, to put it in the fewest words, is nothing less than to inaugurate in America, by means of a genuinely native imaginative literature, a new era of intellectual and spiritual development. Or to put it differently, and to use the eloquent words of W. M. Rossetti, he 'occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one\u2014a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the continent, or the Washington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America.' This purpose is surely a noble one, and which, if at all seriously followed, cannot fail to be fruitful in extraordinary power. And that this is the purpose which Whitman has continually set before him he has frequently declared. 'Democratic Vistas,' his various Prefaces, and several other of his prose essays may be taken as a sort of apology justifying it. But, nowhere has he given more noble utterance to it, as Mr. Rossetti has also pointed out, than in the following lines:\u2014</p><p>'Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,<br>I will make the most splendxml:id race the sun ever shone upon,<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades,<br>'I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, <br>and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,<br>I will make inseparable cities with their arms around each other's necks,<br>By the love of comrades<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>'For you, these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!<br>For you, for you, I am trilling these songs.'</p><p>Besxml:ides an 'imperious conviction and the commands of his nature as total and as irresistible as those which make the sea flow, or the globe revolve,' Whitman's incentives to this great and unquestionably beneficent task are partly in the condition of American society, and partly in the character of American literature.</p><p>The spectacle presented by American society he describes as 'appalling.' Everywhere he sees hollowness, hypocrisy, deceit; in the business classes a depravity 'infinitely greater than has been supposed;' 'corruption, falsehood, and maladministration in branches and departments of the official services, whether national, state, or municipal;' in 'fashionable life flippancy, tepxml:id armours, weak infxml:idelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time;' 'in literature a scornful superciliousness;' 'in the churches and sects the most dismal phantasms usurping the name of religion.' 'The best class we shew,' he writes, 'is but a mob of fashionably-dress'd speculators and vulgarians.' Though an unwavering believer in democracy, and joyfully recognising the 'immense success of the New World democracy in lifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain species of intellectual culture,' he is nevertheless painfully oppressed by the conviction that so far 'in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, esthetic results, it is almost a complete failure,' 'in vain, he exclaims, 'do we march with unprecedented strxml:ides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annexed Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north to Canada and south to Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.' Or take the following passage from the 'Democratic Vistas,' which, while it illustrates his style in prose writing, clearly indicates one at least of the reasons why he has devoted himself to his self-imposed task:\u2014</p><p>'Let me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations, localities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition. After an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bays, sparkling sea txml:ides, costly and lofty new buildings, facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich ships, the wharves, the great Central Park and the Brooklyn Park of hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)\u2014the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters\u2014these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my sense of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the east and north rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in the Wall Street, or the Gold Exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas\u2014but in the artificial, the work of man, too, is equally great\u2014in this profusion of teeming humanity\u2014in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships\u2014these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p><p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real importance, personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask\u2014Are there, indeed, men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Is there a great moral and religious civilization\u2014the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infxml:idelity\u2014everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe\u2014everywhere an abnormal libxml:idinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood decreasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (consxml:idering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p><p>Turning to the literature of America, any 'breath recuperative of sane and heroic life' to breathe into these lamentable conditions, Whitman nowhere finds. That which he observes to be everywhere lacking is native or original power. Workers in a certain sort of literature he sees in abundance; but 'touched by the national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality, they wither,' he affirms, 'to ashes.' 'I have not seen,' he remarks, 'a single writer, artist, lecturer, or what not, that has confronted the voiceless, but ever erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the land, in a spirit kindred to itself.' And, again, 'consxml:idered with reference to purposes of patriotism, health, and noble personality, religion, and the democratic adjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic plays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of our best xml:ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish no one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no one, and suffice only the lowest levels of vacant minds.' Morally and artistically, he affirms, America has as yet originated nothing. 'We see the sons and daughters of the New World,' he observes, 'ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the universal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and the dead. We see London, Paris, Italy\u2014not original, superb, as where they belong, but secondhand here, where they do not belong. We see the shreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks, but where on her own soil do we see, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.' The central point of a nation, and that whence it is swayed and sways others, that which consolxml:idates its various parts, and is the source at once of its inspiration and influence, is, he believes, its national literature, and more especially its archetypal poems, but any such literature or poems America, he maintains, does not possess.</p><p>What then is the literature he desires and to what extent has he realised this desire in his own works? The answer to the first of these questions the foregoing paragraphs have already suggested. Those who wish for a fuller and more explicit answer we must refer to Specimen Days and Collect, and more especially to the 'Democratic Vistas,' the Prefaces of 1855 and 1876, and to the essay on 'Poetry To-day in America\u2014Shakespeare\u2014The Future,' where Whitman has unfolded his xml:ideas at consxml:iderable length, and frequently with great eloquence and power. In the space now remaining at our disposal we shall point out one or two of the features of the literature he has produced, premising, however, that many of the questions we shall be obliged to pass over in silence.</p><p>Whitman's principle defect, as a poet, lies, as it seems to us, and as we have already saxml:id, in the direction of his artistic power. That which strikes the reader first on opening Leaves of Grass is the singular appearance of its pages. The ordinary forms of versification Whitman has discarded, and adopted in their stead one which reminds us of Ossian, the writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the Vedas. By his thorough-paced admirers this is claimed as a sign of originality and strength. In our opinion, it is a sign of weakness. A really great poet, one, that is, who is thoroughly perfect in all the branches of his art, is a master of expression. Whitman confessedly is not. After many trials he was forced, he tells us, to give up the attempt to express himself in the forms employed by the great poets of the principal literary nations, and to use the mode he has here adopted. There is running through his works, as Mr. Rossetti has very truly remarked, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical movement and a sustained melody which are admirable, as for example\u2014'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,' 'O Captain, my Captain,' 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed.' These, however, are exceptions. Generally speaking, Whitman's lines are deficient in melody. Music of a certain kind they certainly have; but they want the measured cadence, the flowing melody, that exquisite rhythmical charm which makes the words of the great poets take hold of the mind and live in the memory as the sweetest strain of a noble song. Nor can it be saxml:id that by adopting this peculiar mode of versification Whitman has secured any advantages superior to those afforded by the ordinary forms. That he has obtained a greater freedom may probably be admitted; but it is questionable whether it is not at the expense of effectiveness. To take but a single illustration. The thought of the following is admirable:\u2014</p><p>'There was a child went forth every day:<br>And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;<br>And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part <br>of the day,<br>Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years<br>         .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .  <br>     The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt-marsh <br>and shore-mud;<br>These become part of that child who went forth every day, and <br>who now goes, and will always go forth every day.'</p><p>ut compare with it Wordsworth's treatment of the same theme:\u2014</p><p>'The stars of mxml:idnight shall be dear<br>To her: and she shall lean her ear<br>In many a secret place,<br>Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br>And beauty born of murmuring sound<br>Shall pass into her face.'</p><p>Whatever may be saxml:id in favour of Whitman's treatment, the advantages, so far as general effectiveness is concerned, are plainly with Wordsworth. The last two lines, besxml:ides having a fulness and suggestiveness about them quite equal to all that Whitman has saxml:id, or has attempted to say, have a music and a charm of expression on which the ear delights to dwell. Whitman's neglect of the art of expression is calculated, we think, to tell greatly against him. That he is capable of great things in this way we do not doubt. The poems referred to above, and others we could name, are a proof of the consummate work he might have done, had he been less impatient of restraint and more devoted to the perfecting of his skill in what is in reality one of the main sources of the poet's power. It must not be supposed, however, that Whitman is indifferent to the charms of art, or that, in his revolt against conventionalism, he has no rules or principles of his own. To those who imagine so we commend the perusal of what follows from the Preface of 1855:\u2014</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity\u2014nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the road-sxml:ide, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of some flowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writings any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. What I tell I tell precisely for what is. Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my sxml:ide and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>In 'Children of Adam,' Whitman has sinned, we think, against good taste, common sense, and, in fact, as one of his critics has pointed out, against one of his own canons. True, he has probably violated no moral law, and has simply spoken of what nature permits. It is true also that according to Schiller, whatever nature permits, is permitted also to art. Still, there are some things on which men have agreed to be silent, and though we are by no means disposed to regard conventionality as the standard of morals, we cannot avoxml:id the conviction that by speaking of the sexual relations in the way in which he has, Whitman has violated a natural instinct of the human mind. That he is an immoral writer, as some of his critics have maintained, we do not believe. His fault is one of manner rather than of spirit, and has its origin in an error of judgement rather than in a wrong bias of the mind. His deepest spirit and highest aim are, it seems to us, religious; and nothing, we imagine, but a strong sense of duty could have made him withstand so patiently and persistently the fierce storm of invective and abuse which some of his poems have aroused against him.</p><p>Whitman's faults, however, are greatly outweighed by his merits. First we may notice that in spirit he is intensely American. In the poets of other lands he is evxml:idently well read; yet, he is an imitator of none. His manner, style, and spirit are entirely his own. Previous to him the poetry of American was, as has been justly observed, merely the poetry of apt pupils, with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. The poems of Bryant and Longfellow might have been written as easily on the banks of the Thames as on the banks of the Hudson. There is little in them that is distinctively American. Whitman's poems, on the other hand, are saturated through and through with the spirit of the New World. 'Starting from Paumanock,' 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,' 'A Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Broad Axe,' 'A Song for Occupations,' 'Pioneers! O Pioneers!' 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' 'Drum-taps,' and 'Sea Drift,' it may be safely saxml:id, could not have been written elsewhere than on the American Continent, or by one whose spiritual life had not been reared among its people, and nourished by a life-long communion with its magnificent natural phenomena. Whitman is American also in another sense. He is thoroughly democratic. The Presxml:ident is no more to him than a mason, or woodsman, or western farmer. Any breath of a political aristocracy, of feudalism, or of caste, is not allowed to taint his pages. Their xml:ideas and institutions are entirely alien to his spirit. He could no more have written the xml:idylls of the King, or a play of Shakespeare than he could have written the Iliad. The doctrine which he preaches on every page is the greatness of the indivxml:idual soul. While Spencer writes 'to fashion a gentleman or nobleperson in virtuous and gentle discipline,' Whitman writes to build up a new and splendxml:id race of average men. As a poet of Democracy, as Democracy exists in the New World, he stands alone.</p><p>'The messages of great poets to each man and woman,' he has remarked, 'are, Come to us on equal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you. What we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy.' Of his own poems, this is a marked feature. Their directness is unquestionable. They place the reader on a level with themselves, and make him feel that he is being addressed by one who is of the same flesh and blood as himself, by one whose thoughts and feelings are, or may be his own. And the reason is that, subjective as Whitman's poems are, and distinctively as they teach the doctrine of indivxml:idualism, they always rest on that which is universally human. Perhaps no other poet of the present has a larger vision of that 'great human heart by which we live,' or more persistently announces it. The 'self' of which he sings is not always his own indivxml:idual self; as frequently, if not more so, it is the universal self, that universal being of which each indivxml:idual is but a conscious manifestation. Of this any one can convince himself by a careful reading of the 'Song of Myself.' Take, for instance, the following lines:\u2014</p><p>'I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning <br>and the end.<br>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now;'</p><p>or take the lines with which the song opens:\u2014</p><p>'I celebrate myself, and sing of myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belongs to me as good as belongs to you;'</p><p>or these:\u2014</p><p>'The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br>The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,<br>The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps <br>by his wife;<br>And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br>And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>And of these one and all I weave the song of myself,'</p><p>This mysticism, indeed, forms the background of all Whitman's more important pieces, and is the key to their meaning. Without a clear apprehension of it it is impossible to understand the paradoxes in which his pages abound, or to reconcile his apparent contradictions. Were it not that we have Mr. Burroughs' assertion to the contrary, we should have attributed Whitman's mysticisms to a close study of Emerson. It seems, however, that before he published the first edition of the Leaves of Grass, Whitman had never read Emerson at all, and that he dxml:id not become acquainted with the Essay until the following summer. The similarity of their xml:ideas is remarkable, and may probably be taken as significant of the tendency of American thought.</p><p>Whitman is pre-eminently a poet of the modern world. No other has more thoroughly adopted the conclusions of science, or made a more splendxml:id and impressive use of them in his writings. Not unseldom they give a vastness and grandeur to his thought, which is well-nigh overwhelming. At the same time he is very far from being in any sense or degree a materialist. The supremacy of the spiritual he always loyally, and sometimes ostentatiously, recognises. Though almost Greek in his sympathy with nature, and notwithstanding the manner in which he has sung of man's physical constitution, the position which he assigns to the soul is always incomparably higher, as the following from his Preface of 1876 clearly shows:\u2014</p><p>'Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a higher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too) the spiritual the religious\u2014which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred-fold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the divine, and of the xml:ideal, through mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the objective worlds\u2026 To me the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendxml:id theology, and for ampler and diviner songs.'</p><p>Still, notwithstanding his modern tone of thought, and the democratic spirit which pervades his writings, the past is by no means disdained by Whitman. Past, present, and future, he holds, are not disjoined but joined. The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been. The present, he affirms, is but a stage in the eternal process of creative thought, and is what is through the past. At the same time, however, while admitting his indebtedness to the past, and claming kinship with it, he asserts also his independence, and claims to stand in his own place with his own day about him:\u2014</p><p>'I conn'd old times,<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.<br>In the name of These States shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophers, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, investors, governments long since<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted <br>hither<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it)<br>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more <br>than it deserves,<br>Regarding it all intensely a long while, then dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place with my own day here.'</p><p>We are warned, however, that our space is already exhausted, and can refer to but one other of the many features of Whitman's poetry. After pointing out that formerly he was consxml:idered the best poet who composed the most perfect work, or the one which was most complete in every respect, Sainte-Beuve has remarked that for us in the present the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's imagination and reflection; not he who has done the best, but he who suggests the most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, who leaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in your turn.' Judged by this standard Whitman deserves to take a place among the foremost. His works are preeminently suggestive. Any finished picture he seldom presents. His poems are rather suggestions, arousing the reader, and leading him on and on, till he feels the fresher air of a freer thought breathing around him, and sees spreading out before him the limitless and unknown.</p><p>'I but write one or two indicative words for the future,<br>I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.<br>I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a <br>casual look upon you, and then averts his face,<br>Leaving it to you to prove and define it,<br>Expecting the main things from you.'</p><p>To the religious spirit which breathes through Whitman's writings we have already referred; and our assertions on this point have been borne out by several of the passages we have cited for other purposes. Dxml:id our space permit, numerous other passages might be cited as bearing directly upon it. But as a last word, and as indicating with consxml:iderable fullness the scope and spirit of all that he has written, we transcribe the following:\u2014</p><p>'And thou America,<br>For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality<br>For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.</p><p>'Thou, too, surroundest all,<br>Embracing, carrying, welcoming all, thou, too, by pathways broad and <br>new,<br>To the xml:ideal tendest.</p><p>'The measur'd faith of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,<br>Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,<br>Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,<br>All eligible to all.</p><p>'All for immortality,<br>Love like the light silently wrapping all,<br>Nature's amelioration blessing all,<br>The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,<br>Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening.</p><p>'Give me, O God, to sing that thought<br>Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,<br>In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,<br>Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,<br>Health, peace, salvation, universal.</p><p>'Is it a dream?<br>Nay, but the lack of it the dream?<br>And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,<br>And all the world a dream.'</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2217P. 183.</p><p>\u2020Notes on Walt Whitman, pp. 15-16.</p><p>\u2021Studies in Literature, 1789\u20131877, p. 473.</p>", "date": "Semptember 1883", "year": 1883, "creator": "William Musham Metcalfe", "publication": "The Scottish Review", "citation": "Metcalfe, William Musham [unsigned in original]. \"Walt Whitman.\" September 1883.

Perhaps we must not complain\u2014especially in those cases where the new edition is brought, by its price, within the reach of millions, instead of only thousands\u2014if, when we turn them over, we find most disappointing omissions. Here is a new edition of the 'Poems of Walt Whitman' (published by Chatto and Windus), selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti. It is of convenient bulk, and excellent in paper and type and binding; and we must be thankful, even though there be nothing added to it from the volumes Walt Whitman has published since 1868. Mr. Rossetti is a most loyal and charitable interpreter of this most unmelodious and unrhythmical of poets; this strong, self-assured man, who 'entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature and a great one\u2014a literature proportioned to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the Continent, or the Washington of the States, was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America. Surely a sublime conviction, and expressed more than once in magnificent words\u2014none more so than in the following poem'\u2014 'Love of Comrades':\u2014</p><p>Come, I will make the continent indissoluble;<br>I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet <br>shone upon!<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades.<br>I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the<br> rivers of America, and along the shores of the great <br>lakes, and all over the prairies;<br>I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each <br>other\u2019s necks;<br>By the love of comrades,<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma <br>femme!<br>For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,<br>In the love of comrades,<br>In the high-towering love of comrades.</p><p>Mr. Rossetti believes that this idea of himself 'is true, if not absolutely, yet with a most genuine and substantial approximation.' He believes that Whitman 'is one of the huge, as yet mainly unrecognized, forces of our time; privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by generation after generation of believing and ardent\u2014let us hope not servile\u2014disciples. 'Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.' Shelley, who knew what he was talking about when poetry was the subject, has said it, and with a profundity of truth. Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out for 'legislation' of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken\u2014that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>Great is Walt Whitman, therefore, and W. M. Rossetti is his prophet. All the prophet says about his master may be well judged and true. We are glad we have no need to say it is or it is not. What we do say is that much beauty and much strength are in these poems; but the beauty is often very far to seek, and the strength is often provokingly tedious in its self-manifestations, and we heartily echo the hope of Mr. Rossetti that Whitman's 'disciples' in the future will not be 'servile.' The only poem\u2014assuredly a beautiful one\u2014in the whole collection which can be called rhythmical (and there are in it also some rhymes) is the one 'For the Death of Lincoln':</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done.<br>The ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought<br>is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and<br>daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.<br>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells!<br>Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills:<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you the shores<br>a-crowding:<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces <br>turning.<br>O Captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you.<br>It is some dream that on the dock<br>You've fallen cold and dead!<br>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still:<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will.<br>But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed<br>and done:<br>From fearful trip the victorship comes in with object won!<br>Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>But I, with silent trade,<br>Walk the spot my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>In this and in 'President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn' Whitman is really at his best as a poet; and in some of the 'Drum Taps,' which are the outcome of his brotherly and tender devotion to the wounded soldiers of the North during the great war, the pathos that breathes up through the great jagged lines and sentences is an almost startling revelation of the warmth and depth of his nature. We are not sure that the prose 'Preface to Leaves of Grass' is not greater than anything else he has written. It deserves to be read, and it can be read more easily than many of the poems.</p>", "date": "October 9 1886", "year": 1886, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "Leeds Mercury", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman's Poetry.\" 9 October 1886.

The book is an intertwining of the author's characteristic verse, alternated throughout with prose; and hence the name. In the Preface he says:</p><p><em>At the eleventh hour, under grave illness, I gather up the pieces of prose and poetry left over since publishing a while since my first and main volume, 'Leaves of Grass'\u2014pieces, here, some new, some old\u2014nearly all of them (somber as many are, making this almost Death's book) composed in by-gone atmospheres of perfect health\u2014and preceded by the freshest collection, the little 'Two Rivulets,' now send them out, embodied in the present Melange, partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality\u2014and then as chyle and nutriment to that moral, Indissoluble Union, equally representing All, and the mother of many coming Centennials.</p><p>For some reason\u2014not explainable or definite to my own mind, yet secretly pleasing and satisfactory to it\u2014I have not hesitated to embody in, and run through the volume, two altogether distinct veins or strata\u2014Politics for one, and for the other, the pensive thought of Immortality. The pictures from the hospitals during the war I have also decided to include. Though they differ in character and composition from the rest of my pieces, yet I feel that they ought to go with them, and must do so.</em></p><p>At the outset comes this prelude, or sonata:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey.</p><p>For the Eternal Ocean bound,<br>These ripples, passing surges, streams of Death and Life,<br>Object and Subject, hurrying, whirling by,<br>The Real and Ideal.</p><p>Alternate ebb and flow the Days and Nights,<br>Strands of a Trio twining, Present, Future, Past.</p><p>In You, whoe'er you are, my book perusing,<br>In I myself\u2014in all the World\u2014these ripples flow,<br>All, all, toward the mystic Ocean tending.</p><p>(O yearnful waves! the kisses of your lips!<br>Your breast so broad, with open arms, O firm, expanded shore!)</p><p>And, on a well-known theme this second verse:</p><p>Or, from that Sea of Time,<br>Spray, blown by the wind\u2014a double windrow-drift of<br> weeds and shells.<br>(O little shells, so curious-convolute! so limpid-cold and<br> voiceless!<br>Yet will you not, to the tympans of temples held,<br>Murmurs and echoes still bring up\u2014Eternity's music, <br>faint and far<br>Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica's rim\u2014strains for the <br>Soul of the Prairies.<br>Whisper'd reverberations\u2014chords for the ear of the <br>West, joyously sounding<br>Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable;)<br>Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,<br>(For not my life and years alone I give\u2014all, all I give;)<br>These thoughts and Songs\u2014waifs from the deep\u2014here, <br>cast high and dry.<br>Washed on America's shores.</p><p>Then here is what Whitman terms his own poems:</p><p>Currents of starting a Continent new,<br>Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,<br>Fusion of ocean and land\u2014tender and pensive waves,<br>(not safe and peaceful only\u2014waves rous'd and ominous<br> too,<br>Out of the depths, the storm's abysms\u2014Who knows <br>whence? Death's waves,<br>Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tat-<br>ter'd sail.)</p><p>He says in a concluding part of the preface:</p><p><em>Without being a scientist, I have thoroughly adopted the conclusions of the great savans and experimentalists of our time and of the last hundred years, and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my verse for purposes beyond. Following the modern spirit, the real poems of the present, ever solidifying and expanding into the future, must vocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has invested man and the universe (all that is called creation), and must henceforth launch humanity into new orbits, consonant with that vastness, splendor, and reality (unknown to the old poems), like new systems of orbs, balanced upon themselves, revolving in limitless space, more subtle than the stars. Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at present wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery, and superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the past nor the themes of the past, will be revivified by this tremendous innovation, the kosmic spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion, be the background and underlying impetus, more or less visible, of all first-class songs.</p><p>Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher fact, the eternal soul of man (of all else too), the spiritual, the religious\u2014which it is to be the greatest office of t scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred fold. To me the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the Divine, and of the ideal, though mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the worlds of chemistry or anything in the objective world. To me, the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendid theology, and for ampler and diviner songs. No year, nor even century, will settle this. There is a phase of the real, lurking behind the real, which it is all for. There is also in the intellect of man, in time, far in prospective recesses, a judgment, a last appellate court, which will settle it.</em></p><p><em>EID\u00d3LONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eid\u00f3lons.</p><p>Put in thy chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day\u2014nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance-<br>song of all,<br>That of Eid\u00f3lons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eid\u00f3lons!

Of most foreign countries, small or large, from the remotest times known, down to our own, each has contributed after its kind, directly or indirectly, at least one undying song to help vitalize and increase the valor, wisdom, and elegance of humanity, from the points of view attained by it up to date. The stupendous epics of India, the Holy Bible itself, the Homeric canticles, the Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador, the Inferno, Shakespeare's dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords, Burns's songs, Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in England, Victor Hugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various, yet integral, signs or landmarks (in certain respects the highest set up by the human mind and soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration, &c.), narrating in subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of history, and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate humanity, and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied civilizations. . . . Where is America's art-rendering, in anything like the spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic immortal monuments?</p><p>2. So far, in America, our democratic society (estimating its various strata, in the mass, as one), possesses nothing\u2014nor have we contributed any characteristic music, the finest tie of nationality\u2014to make up for that glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional, artistic, indefinable, indescribably beautiful charm and hold which fused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together in their wonderful interpretation, in Europe and Asia, of love, belief and loyalty, running one way like a living weft\u2014and picturesque responsibility, duty and blessedness, running like a warp the other way. (In the Southern States, under slavery, much of the same.) . . In coincidence, and as things now exist in the States, what is more terrible, more alarming than the total want of any such fusion and mutuality of love, belief and rapport of interest, between the comparatively few successful rich and the great masses of the unsuccessful, the poor? . . As a mixed political and social question, is not this full of dark significance? Is it not worth considering as a problem and puzzle in our democracy--an indispensable want to be supplied?</p></em><p>Whitman gives his own portrait from life in the book\u2014a large, bending, gray-haired man, 'looking at you'\u2014and the picture is illustrated by the following verse:</p><p>Out from behind this bending rough-cut Mask,<br>(All straighter, liker Masks rejected\u2014this preferr'd,)<br>This common curtain of the face, contain'd in me for <br>me, in you for you, in each for each,<br>(Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears\u2014O heaven!<br>The passionate, teeming plays this curtain hid!)<br>The glaze of God's serenest, purest sky,<br>This film of Satan's seething pit,<br>This heart's geography's map\u2014this limitless small conti-<br>nent\u2014this soundless sea,<br>Out from the convolutions of this globe,<br>This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon\u2014than <br>Jupiter, Venus, Mars;<br>This condensation of the Universe\u2014(nay, here the only <br>Universe,<br>Here the Idea\u2014all in this mystic handful wrapt;)<br>These burin'd eyes, flashing to you, to pass to future <br>time,<br>To launch and spin through space revolving, sideling\u2014 <br>from these to emanate,<br>To You, who'er you are\u2014a Look.</p><p><strong>FREEDOM.</strong></p><p><em>It is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand freedom, but I sometimes think I have not yet met one person who rightly understands it. . . . The whole universe is absolute law. Freedom only opens entire activity and license under the law. To the degraded or undeveloped\u2014and even to too many others\u2014the thought of freedom is a thought of escaping from law\u2014which, of course, is impossible.</p><p>More precious than all worldly riches is Freedom\u2014freedom from the painful constipation and poor narrowness of ecclesiasticism; freedom in manners, habiliments, furniture, from the silliness and tyranny of local fashions\u2014entire freedom from party rings and mere conventions in politics\u2014and, better than all, a general freedom of one's self from the tyrannic domination of vices, habits, appetites, under which nearly every man of us (often the greatest bawler for freedom) is enslaved.</p><p>Can we attain such enfranchisement\u2014the true democracy and the hight of it? While we are from birth to death subjects of irresistible law, inclosing every movement and minute, we yet escape by a paradox, into true free will. Strange as it may seem, we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of, and implicit obedience to law. Great\u2014unspeakably great\u2014is the will! the free soul of man! At its greatest, understand and obeying the laws, it can then, and then only, maintain true liberty . . . . . For there is to the highest, that law as absolute as any\u2014more absolute than any\u2014the law of liberty. The shallow, as intimated, consider liberty a release from all law, from every constraint. The wise seee in it, on the contrary, the potent law of laws, namely, the fusion and combination of the conscious will, or partial individual law, with those universal, eternal, unconscious ones, which run through all time, pervade history, prove immortality, give moral purpose to entire objective world, and the last dignity to human life.</em></p><p><em>TO A LOCOMOTIVE IN WINTER.</em><br>Thee for my recitative!<br>Thee in the driving storm even as now\u2014the snow\u2014the <br>Winter-day declining;<br>Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and <br>thy beat convulsive;<br>Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel;<br>Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, <br>gyrating, shuttling at thy sides;<br>Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar\u2014now tapering in the distance;<br>Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front;<br>Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple;<br>The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy <br>smoke-stack;<br>Thy knitted frame\u2014thy springs and valves\u2014the tremu-<br>lous twinkle of thy wheels;<br>Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,<br>Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily <br>careering;<br>Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse<br> of the continent!<br>For once, come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even <br>as here I see thee,<br>With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling <br>snow;<br>By day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes,<br>By night, thy silent signal lamps to swing.</p><p>Fierce-throated beauty!<br>Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music! thy <br>swinging lamps at night;<br>Thy piercing, madly-whistled laughter! thy echoes, rous-<br>ing all!</p><p>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;<br>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano <br>thine,)<br>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,<br>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide\u2014across the lakes,<br>To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.</p><p><strong>NEW POETRY\u2014PROSE GRANDER THAN VERSE.</strong></p><p><em>In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . . In my opinion, I say, while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time played great and fitting parts, that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably rendered in rhyming verse\u2014that there have been very illustrious poets, whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloped\u2014and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age\u2014it is, not withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression, present or future it palpably fails, and must fail to serve. The muse of the prairies, and the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully enlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people, with the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong to them, body and soul\u2014to the general globe, and all its relations in astronomy, as the savans portray them to us\u2014to the modern, the busy nineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different), with steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder presses\u2014to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth\u2014to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or on shipboard, or on lakes and rivers\u2014resumes that other medium of expression, more flexible, more eligible\u2014soars to the freer, vast, diviner heaven of prose.</em></p><p>The volume, in its 350 pages, comprises, besides the 'Two Rivulets,' from which the foregoing extracts are taken, the prose essay, 'Democratic Vistas,' and the poetical pieces already published under the same name of 'Passage to India.' Quite a large part of the book is occupied with Whitman's 'Memoranda During the War,' in the army hospitals, or down at the front, being given verbatim from the original notes of the time, 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty or defeat or of action, or of getting ready for it, or a march.' He says, as he introduces these little note-book mementoes of the war:</p><p><em>Vivid as life they recall and identify the long hospital wards, with their myriad-varied scenes of day or night; the graphic incidents of field or camp; the night before the battle with many solemn yet cool preparations; the changeful exaltations and depressions of those four years, North and South; the convulsive memories (left but a word, a broken sentence serve to recall them); the clews already quite vanished, like some old dream, and yet the list significant enough to soldiers; the scrawled, worn slips of paper that came up by bushels from the Southern prisons, Salisbury or Andersonville, by the hands of exchanged prisoners; the clank of crutches on the pavements or floors of Washington, or up and down the stairs of Paymasters' offices; the grand review of home-bound veterans at the close of the war, cheerily marching day after day by the President's bouse, one brigade succeeding another until it seemed as if they would never end; the strange squads of Southern deserters (escapees, I called them); that little g\u00e9nre group, unrock'd amid the mighty whirl, I remember passing in a hospital corner, of a dying Irish boy, a Catholic priest, and an impoverished altar; four years compressing centuries of native passion, first-class pictures, tempests of life and death, an inexhaustible mine for the histories, drama, romance, and even philosophy of centuries to come; indeed, the vertebra of poetry and art (or personal character too) for all future America (far more grand, in my opinion, to the hands capable of it, than Homer's siege of Tory or the French wars of Shakespeare); and looking over all, in my remembrance, the tall form of President Lincoln, with his face of deep-cut lines, with the large, kind, canny eyes, the complexion of dark brown, and the tinge of weird melancholy saturating all.</p><p>More and more, in my recollections of that period, and through its varied, multitudinous oceans and murky whirls, appear the central resolution and sternness of the bulk or the average American people, animated in soul by a definite purpose, though sweeping and fluid as some great storm\u2014the common people, emblemized in thousands of specimens of first-class heroism, steadily accumulating, (nor regiment, no company, hardly a file of men, North or South, the last three years, without such first-class specimens.)</p><p>I know not how it may have been, or may be, to others\u2014to me the main interest of the war, I found (and still, on recollection, find), in those specimens, and in the ambulance, the hospital, and even the dead on the field. To me, the points illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities of these States, in the two or three millions of Americans young and middle-aged men, North and South, embodied in armies--and especially the one-third or one-fourth of their number, stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest\u2014were of more significance even than the political interests involved.</em></p><p>We also add a few hitherto unpublished forthcoming pieces from 'Leaves of Grass.' On the new title page of that volume appears the following verse, signed by Whitman's autograph:</p><p>Come, said my Soul,<br>Such verses for my Body let us write (for we are one),<br>That should I after death invisibly return,<br>Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,<br>There to some group of mates, the chants resuming<br>(Tallying Earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves),<br>Ever with pleased smile I may keep on,<br>Ever and ever yet the verses owing\u2014as, first-I here and <br>now,<br>Singing for Soul and Body, set to them my name.</p><p><em>AFTER AN INTERVAL.<br>(Nov. 22, 1875, midnight\u2014Saturn and Mars in conjunction.)</em><br>After an interval, reading, here in the midnight,<br>With the great stars looking on\u2014all the stars of Orion <br>looking,<br>And the silent Pleiades\u2014and the duo looking of Saturn <br>and ruddy Mars;<br>Pondering, reading my own songs, after a long interval <br>(sorrow and death familiar now),<br>Ere closing the book, what pride! what joy! to find them,<br>Standing so well the test of death and night!<br>And the duo of Saturn and Mars!</p><p><em>WHEN THE FULL-GROWN POET CAME.</em><br>When the full-grown poet came,<br>Out spake pleas'd Nature (the round impassive Globe, <br>with all its shows of day and night), saying, He is <br>mine;<br>But out spake too the Soul of Man, proud, jealous and un-<br>reconciled, Nay, he is mine alone;<br>\u2014Then the full-grown Poet stood between the two, and <br>took each by the hand,<br>And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly <br>holding hands,<br>Which he will never release until he reconciles the two,<br>And wholly and joyously blends them.</p><p><em>THE BEAUTY OF THE SHIP.</em><br>When, staunchly entering port,<br>After long ventures, hauling up, worn and old,<br>Better'd by sea and wind, torn by many a fight,<br>With the original sails all gone, replaced, or mended,<br>I only saw, at last the beauty of the ship.</p><p>The following are extracts from 'Two Rivulets:'</p><p><em>A SONG BY THE POTOMAC.</em><br>By broad Potomac's shore\u2014again, old tongue!<br>(Still uttering\u2014still ejaculating\u2014canst never cease this <br>babble?)<br>Again, old heart so gay\u2014again to you, your sense, the <br>full flush Spring returning;<br>Again the freshness and the odors\u2014again Virginia's Sum-<br>mer sky, peliucid blue and silver<br>Again the forenoon purple of the hills,<br>Again the deathbed grass, so noiseless, soft and green,<br>Again the blood-red roses blooming.</p><p>Perfume this book of mine, O blood-red roses!<br>Lave subtly with your waters every line, Potomac!<br>Give me of you, O Spring, before I close, to put between <br>its pages!<br>O foresoon purple of the hills, before I close, of you!<br>O smiling earth\u2014O Summer sun, give me of you!<br>O deathless grass, of you!</p><p><em>SHIP OF DEMOCRACY.</em><br>Sail\u2014sail thy best, ship of Democracy!<br>Of value is they freight\u2014'tis not the Present only,<br>The past is also stored in thee!<br>Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone\u2014not of <br>thy western continent alone;<br>Earth's resume entire floats on thy keel, O ship\u2014is<br> steadied by thy spars;<br>With thee Time voyages in trust\u2014the antecedent nations <br>sink or swim with thee;<br>With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, <br>wars, thou bear'st the other continents;<br>Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port <br>triumphant;<br>\u2014Steer, steer with good strong band and wary eye, O <br>helmsman\u2014thou carryest great companions,<br>Venerable, priestly Asia sails this day with thee,<br>And royal, feudal Europe sails with thee.</p>", "date": "February 19 1876", "year": 1876, "creator": "unknown", "publication": "The New York Daily Tribune", "citation": "[Unknown]. \"Walt Whitman's Poems.\" 19 February 1876.

WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p><p>NEW YORK, FEB. 23.</p><p>The only American prophet to my knowledge who enjoys a fame in England not accorded him in his own country is the prophet of the new Democratic school of poetry, Walt. Whitman. Although his earlier publications attracted here a certain degree of attention in literary circles, and aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among some of the 'plain people,' whose singer he especially desired to be called, it can hardly be said that his claims to the rank of poet were seriously considered in America until they had been discussed by Mr. W. M. Rosetti [sic], Mr. Robert Buchanan, and other authorities in London. The dubious position which he won here by their help he has not been able to hold. To-day he probably has ten admirers and readers abroad for every one that he has at home. There is a rough honesty, a wild sort of sweetness in the strange man's character, an evident genuineness in his eccentricities, both personal and literary, which have won for him general respect and even a great deal of popular affection, while the estimate of his poetical powers, accepted a few years ago, has been steadily declining. He is no longer one of the curiosities of the Republic; and while the stories of his extreme poverty and suffering which recently obtained circulation are, I am glad to say, untrue, he has fallen into obscurity, if not into positive neglect, and apparently into a mood of sorrow. The impression which one gathers from a few sheets of his forthcoming volume is at any rate rather a melancholy one. He calls the new book 'Two Rivulets,' for it contains a stream of prose and a stream of verse:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey;</p><p>And he sends it out 'partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality, and then as chyle and nutriment of that moral and indissoluble union, equally representing all, and the mother of many coming centennials.' Nor is it only in the form of the pieces composing the book that he follows a double line. There are two distinct veins of thought-Politics and Immortality. The rivulets are rude, brawling streams, no doubt, but they keep within much narrower bounds than the turbulent streams of his earlier poems. He has no respect for artificial barriers to poetic inspiration:</p><p><em>In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . .

Whitman. Although his earlier publications attracted here a certain degree of attention in literary circles, and aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among some of the 'plain people,' whose singer he especially desired to be called, it can hardly be said that his claims to the rank of poet were seriously considered in America until they had been discussed by Mr. W. M. Rosetti [sic], Mr. Robert Buchanan, and other authorities in London. The dubious position which he won here by their help he has not been able to hold. To-day he probably has ten admirers and readers abroad for every one that he has at home. There is a rough honesty, a wild sort of sweetness in the strange man's character, an evident genuineness in his eccentricities, both personal and literary, which have won for him general respect and even a great deal of popular affection, while the estimate of his poetical powers, accepted a few years ago, has been steadily declining. He is no longer one of the curiosities of the Republic; and while the stories of his extreme poverty and suffering which recently obtained circulation are, I am glad to say, untrue, he has fallen into obscurity, if not into positive neglect, and apparently into a mood of sorrow. The impression which one gathers from a few sheets of his forthcoming volume is at any rate rather a melancholy one. He calls the new book 'Two Rivulets,' for it contains a stream of prose and a stream of verse:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey;</p><p>and he sends it out 'partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality, and then as chyle and nutriment of that moral and indissoluble union, equally representing all, and the mother of many coming centennials.' Nor is it only in the form of the pieces composing the book that he follows a double line. There are two distinct veins of thought-Politics and Immortality. The rivulets are rude, brawling streams, no doubt, but they keep within much narrower bounds than the turbulent streams of his earlier poems. He has no respect for artificial barriers to poetic inspiration:\u2014</p><p><em>'In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . . In my opinion, I say, while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time played great and fitting parts, that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably rendered in rhyming verse\u2014that there have been very illustrious poets, whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloped\u2014and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age\u2014it is, not withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression, present or future it palpably fails, and must fail to serve. The muse of the prairies, and the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully enlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people, with the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong to them, body and soul\u2014to the general globe, and all its relations in astronomy, as the savans portray them to us\u2014to the modern, the busy nineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different), with steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder presses\u2014to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth\u2014to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or on shipboard, or on lakes and rivers\u2014resumes that other medium of expression, more flexible, more eligible\u2014soars to the freer, vast, diviner heaven of prose.'</em></p><p>There is both force and truth in a good deal of what he then says\u2014for even the poets of all schools admit that rhyme is merely the 'colour to the drawing,' and that blank verse is the experimentum crucis by which to try all real poetry\u2014in fact, as our readers are aware, rhyme only came into use with the early troubadours, who doubtless found that in an age when 'books were not,' and their songs were 'as household words,' that the 'jingle' at the end acted as a sort of mental fishhook, and so enabled them to be more easily remembered. Tho two oldest and grandest poems in the world, perhaps\u2014the sacred one of 'Job,' and the secular one of the 'Iliad,' are in blank verse, or, to speak more correctly, in rhythmical prose, and to rhyme them is not only to ruin them, but is also, more or less, a desecration, even despite Pope's splendid attempt of the one, and because of the miserable 'metrical failures' with the other. Also, Whitman is undoubtedly right in this, that inasmuch as 'the proper study of mankind is man,' so the present should interpret the present, and that there is scope in each age for a great poet to interpret the voice of that special age, and that the 'wonders of steam and telegraphy' have as much claim on us, who have helped their Herculean birth, and are profiting by the labours of their giant man-hood, and have as much right to be 'sung greatly of' by a great singer, as even the mighty men and things of the mighty past, which yet, after all (however 'distance may lend enchantment to the view,' and however grandly they may loom out of the depths of the ancient ages, and seem magnified in the dim mists of antiquity,) were not mightier to the men of their day\u2014nor cannot be really mightier to the men of this\u2014than their own mighty present is, with its boundless material power in its thunder throbs of chained and harnessed lightning, and its spiritual strength in the awakening and widening thrills of higher thought and larger life which pulse profoundly through the great living heart of humanity, with a holier purpose, a stronger will, and a more universal charity than the past ever knew or dreamt of, which even the present yet scarcely foresees the outcome of, and which perchance, the future will fully realise, into the brotherhood of all mankind, and the loving practice of 'peace and goodwill on Earth unto all men!'</p><p.'Yes, my brethren, oh! be hopeful, for the storm precedes <br>the shine,<br>Thro' the clouds of ignorance roll we-on today-dawns more <br>divine.'</p><p>Whitman practises what he preaches by 'singing of steam' in his 'To a Locomotive in Winter,' thus\u2014</p><p>Thee for my recitative!<br>Thee in the driving storm\u2014even as now\u2014the Winter-day <br>declining;<br>Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy<br> beat convulsive;<br>Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel;<br>Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, <br>gyrating, shuttling at thy sides;<br>Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar\u2014now tapering in <br>the distance;<br>Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front;<br>Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate<br> purple;<br>The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke- <br>stack;<br>Thy knitted frame\u2014thy springs and valves\u2014the tremulous <br>twinkle of thy wheels;<br>Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,<br>Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily <br>careering;<br>Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of <br>the continent!<br>For once, come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even as <br>here I see thee,<br>With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow;<br>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;<br>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)<br>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,<br>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide\u2014across the lakes,<br>To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.</p><p>A very characteristic poem of his, though much less 'extravagant,' is</p><p><em>EID\u00d3LONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eid\u00f3lons.</p><p>Put in they chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day\u2014nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance- <br>song of all,<br>That of Eid\u00f3lons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eid\u00f3lons!

(Camden, 1876.)</p><p>THE new volume by Walt Whitman will not be found to contain any very important illustrations of his theory of poetic composition, or any very original ethical statements, but it throws a good deal of light upon his personal character, and embraces much individual and incidental matter which is of very high interest. In the first place, we fancy that it will be difficult for any sincere critic, desirous of judging without prejudice on either side, to read the 'Memoranda during the War' without acknowledging that the author is personally brave and self-sacrificing, and the preface to the whole without admitting that his aims are pure and his belief in his own mission genuine. It has become difficult to speak of Whitman without passion. His opponents expend upon him every term of obloquy, private and public, which their repertory contains; his more extreme admirers claim for him all the respect reserved, long after their deaths, for the founders of successful religions. Between the class that calls Whitman an immoral charlatan bent on the corruption of youth, and the class that accounts him an inspired prophet, sent, among other iconoclastic missions, to abolish the practice of verse, there lies a great gulf. One would like to ask if it be not permitted that one should hold, provisionally, an intermediate position, and consider him a pure man of excellent intentions, to whom certain primitive truths with regard to human life have presented themselves with great vividness, and who has chosen to present them to us in semi-rhythmic, rhetorical language, which rises occasionally, in fervent moments, to a kind of inarticulate poetry, and falls at others into something very inchoate and formless. A wise admirer might even say that the book called Leaves of Grass was intended to give a section, as it were, of the ordinary daily life of a normal man, and therefore properly falls, as every life does, occasionally into shapeless passages of mere commonplace or worse, Poetry proper being always occupied with the rapid and ecstatic moments of life, whether in sorrow or pleasure. The folly of refusing to admit any beauty in Whitman's work seems obvious in the face of a dozen such passages as the famous 'Burial Hymn,' or the picturesque parts of the rhapsody called 'Walt Whitman;' the danger of acknowledging him with too little reserve is best realised if one conceives the dread possibility of the arising of a school of imitators of his tuneless recitative.</p><p>The book before us contains all the small miscellaneous writings of Whitman now collected for the first time. In verse (or recitative) we have the 'Passage to India,' which appeared in 1872 sic, and 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free,' dating from the same year. The prose book called Democratic Vistas was printed in 1871, and all, therefore, which we have to consider here is the opening cluster of rhythmical pieces called 'Two Rivulets,' the 'Centennial Songs,' and the prose 'Memoranda during the War,' all which are now published for the first time. Of the brief but varied contents of the first of these, the most remarkable is a dramatic soliloquy put into the mouth of the dying Columbus, who, sick to death with grief and disappointment, but indomitable still, paces the shores of Jamaica and utters his piteous and majestic lament:\u2014</p><p>'I am too full of woe!<br>Haply I may not live another day;<br>I cannot rest, O God,I cannot eat<br>Or drink or sleep, till I put forth myself,<br>My prayer, once more to Thee,<br>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune<br>With Thee, report myself once more with Thee.'</p><p>The division into lines is our own, the sequence of no words being altered, and it will be seen how naturally the slow march falls into scarcely irregular blank verse. This piece, which might take a place among the death-songs of 'A Passage to India' may be contrasted with 'The Ox-Tamer,' a very fine study of life in the West, where</p><p>'In a far-away northern county, in the placid, pas-<br>toral region,<br>Lives my farmer-friend, the theme of my recitative, <br>a famous Tamer of Oxen.'</p><p>This is a worthy pendent to the description of the bridal of the Trapper, and the similar passages of marvellous picturesque directness to be found in Leaves of Grass. An address 'To a Locomotive in Winter' is certainly the most vivid and imaginative view of an apparently hopeless subject yet achieved. 'From that Sea of Time' presents a remarkably beautiful idea of the poet holding to his ear, one after another, the limpid and voiceless shells blown up on the shore of history, and hopelessly striving to gain from their murmurs some tidings of the sea of Time from whence they come, a thought kindred to the famous fancies of Wordsworth and of Landor. There is not much else in the section which possesses special merit, and there is one piece, called 'Eidolons,' which contains almost every vicious habit of style which Whitman has ever adopted, and which is quite enough, alone, to make the general objection to his writings plausible.</p><p>Of the four 'Centennial Songs,' one, 'The Song of the Redwood Tree,' has something primitive or Vedic in the strength of imagination which links in it in one great chorus the vast forces of nature, rain and snow and the wild winds, colossal trees, and huge mountains, and the serene skies above them all. This heroic chant is full of an arrogance appropriate to the occasion, and is far above any perfunctory trickle of complimentary song. The other three rhapsodies are hardly poetic, though vigorous and sympathetic. In the determination 'to sing a song no poet yet has chanted,' Whitman forces into his page an enumeration, of necessity fragmentary and whimsical, of the mechanical inventions and natural products of America. The result is decidedly grotesque. There is a very advanced Swedish poet of our day who has introduced 'petroleum' into his verse, but that was in singing of the French Commune, and even he, and certainly every other bardic person, small or great, would shrink from inditing such a line as:\u2014</p><p>'Steam-power, the great express-lines, gas, petro-<br>leum .'</p><p>The catalogue of the limbs of the human body, which has been so much laughed at in Leaves of Grass, was better than this. To Whitman the world and all it contains is so ceaselessly exciting and delightful that he is willing to let any objects whatever pass before his imagination in a kind of ceaseless phantasmagoria. This, however, is not enough for a poet; he has a constructive and elective work to do. Shelley has described the poet's enjoyment in the mere lazy observation of the current facts of nature, but he has not neglected to observe that this is not in itself poetry, any more than food or even chyle is in itself blood, for he has been careful to add:\u2014</p><p>'Out of these create he can<br>Forms more real than living man.'</p><p>It would be too much to assert that no poet will ever arise great enough to create nurselings of immortality out of the observation of such matters as express-lines, gas or petroleum, but certainly to recapitulate with emphasis the names of these things is not to produce poetry.</p><p>Space is not left us to characterise fully the 'Memoranda during the War.' They are notes, fragments, ejaculations of the most unaffected kind, and do more than any other writing to endear Whitman to us. There is something inexpressibly tender and manly in the tone of these notes; and something exceedingly stirring in the description of the alternate excitement and depression of the war-time: the pleasure in the presence around him of so many brave and handsome men, all fired with the same patriotic exaltation; the sadness of watching the deaths of so many of these in the prime of life. In the true spirit of his own passionate 'Calamus,' he wandered from tent to tent, ministering to the dying, comforting the wounded, bearing everywhere about with him that fragment of fragrant reed, that fascination of personal character, which he values so highly, and which he exercises over many who know him only through his books. From a literary point of view, his prose style may be justly criticised as heavy and disjointed, but the intrinsic interest of the story easily carries the reader above it. In some cases, as in the marvellously powerful description of the scene in the theatre when President Lincoln was shot, he is swept away into real eloquence, as in his recitatives into real poetry, by the fervour of his imagination. The ethical purpose of the book\u2014and it is needless to say that it has one\u2014manifestly is to exemplify in a very tragical passage of real life the possibility of carrying out that principle of sane and self-sacrificing love of comrades for one another which Whitman has so often celebrated in his most elevated and mystical utterances. It is the old story of Achilles and Patroclus transferred from windy Troy to the banks of the Potomac. It is conceivable that when all Whitman's theories about verse and democracy and religion have been rejected or have become effete, this one influence may be still at work, a permanent bequest of widened emotion to all future generations.</p><p>EDMUND W.

Author's Edition. Camden, New Jersey, U.S.A.</p><p>It is now many years since the peace and placidity of the Republic of Letters, beginning to be shaken a little here at home by new songs of new singers, was first disturbed by the announcement of the advent of a great new poet on the other side of the Atlantic, a poet who, according to the expressions of the little band\u2014small indeed but rapidly waxing\u2014was to answer to the desire of one of Longfellow's prose-characters, and be the Bard of America with a song appropriate to the vastness of the subject. The poet's name was Walt Whitman, and by this magic name his faithful followers conjured until they got people to read these poems they loved so much. Then, indeed, the storm broke on the heads of the devoted adherents. The form of his song was not that to which so many centuries of European civilisation had been accustomed, therefore it was wholly unmusical, discordant, monstrous, horrible, and shapeless. But this was not all. Behind chaos came hell. The giant who broke light-hearted through the meshes of sonnet and sextain and rondel, who would have laughed with hearty Titanic laughter had he but known of them, at the quaint conceits and recipes of good Master George Puttenham for proportion poeticall, in staffe and in measure, and who recked not of lozenge or Tricquet, Pillaster, spire, sphere, or ovall, was discovered daring to speak of the body to a goodly and God-fearing generation, and for this Homeric simplicity was held as one of the company of the Arbiter or the Aretine. But, if many opposed him, many were of his party, and the most opposite and opposed schools of poetry agreed on this one point\u2014admiration of the new master. But whether praised or blamed, Walt Whitman, with Carlyle's Danton, walked his own wild road whither it led him. But it has led him from the Pays de l'amour, and from passion of any sort, as it has led one of our own sweet chief poets, who once sang love and was cried at for singing, into the fierce arena of political struggle. In 'The Two Rivulets' will be found no stream, no little runlet, that has passed through the Eden-garden of the children of Adam, nor are the waters ruffled by any wind-blown echo of Calamus, nor does the amorous animal\u2014man\u2014roll on and trample down the grass-leaves. Walt Whitman's new volume consists of 'Two Rivulets,'</p><p>For the eternal ocean bound<br>These ripples, passing surges, streams of death and life,</p><p>twin channels of poetry and prose; the already familiar 'Democratic Vistas,' 'Centennial Songs,' 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions free,' 'Memoranda during War,' and 'Passage to India.' There is no need to revive here, even in slightest measure, any part of the old quarrel as to the ex-act designation suitable for such of the works of Walt Whitman as their author considers to be fitly baptised as poems. The power of the singer may be seen still vigorous in the poems 'Eidolons' and 'To a Locomotive in Winter;' the latter wonderful in its investiture of the mechanical monster with the parament of poetry and poetic thought, perhaps not wholly to be understood or appreciated except by those who have been in America; who have with it, in the 'driving snow' of 'a winter day declining,' been</p><p>Launched o'er the prairies wide\u2014across the lakes<br>To the free skies, unpent and glad and strong.</p><p>Here, too, in the 'After the Sea-ship,' as in 'The Song of All Seas,' which concludes the series of Centennial Songs, is found evidence of the writer's strong love and feeling for the sea and for its children, the rivers and lakes, which are found at their mightiest on the American continent. And this strong love for the sea he feels for all Nature. Truly Mr. Symonds says of him in 'The Greek Poets,' 'Hopeful and fearless, accepting the world as he finds it, recognising the value of each human impulse, shirking no obligation, self-regulated by a law of perfect health, he, in the midst of a chaotic age, emerges clear and distinct, at one with nature, and therefore Greek.' It was this admiration, this passionate worship of Nature, which led to much denunciation of the worshipper; it is this which still inspires and informs his work. But the present volume is distinctly a political, a historical, or, perhaps more correctly still, a prophetic book, and it deals with and treats of the mighty future of America. Walt Whitman has been often, and with justice, compared to the painter\u2014poet\u2014prophet William Blake; like him he has not, it may be, obtained the recognition due to him; in this at least he suffers more than Blake, that he is better known in the land of the stranger than at home. Americans question his right to be the typical singer of America. Yet Walt Whitman has merits that no American prose-writer or poet ever yet had, with virtues and strength sufficient for claiming laureateship of the great American nation. Nothing in its way could be more splendidly dramatic and grandly descriptive than the account of the assassination of President Lincoln, one of the greatest and noblest of the central figures of modern political evolution. Space will not permit of its complete quotation from the Memoranda of the War, 'these soiled and creas'd little livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin\u2026 blotched here and there with more than one blood stain,' which are amongst the most precious of Whitman's possessions\u2014amongst the most precious of his gifts.</p><p>After relating how it was announced that Lincoln would be at the theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, and describing the contrast of the fearful tragedy about to be performed with the nature of the performance\u2014Our American Cousin\u2014at which Lincoln, who enjoyed theatrical performances, was present, he proceeds:\u2014</p><p>Through the general hum following the stage pause, with the change of positions, etc., came the muffled sound of a pistol shot which not one hundredth part of the audience heard at the time\u2014and yet a moment's hush\u2014somehow, surely a vague startled thrill\u2014and then, through the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and striped space-way of the President's box, a sudden figure, a man, raises himself with hands and feet, stands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage (a distance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet), falls out of position, catching his boot-heel in the copious drapery (the American flag), falls on one knee, quickly recovers himself, rises as if nothing had happen'd (he really sprains his ankle, but unfelt then), and so the figure, Booth, the murderer, dress'd in plain black broadcloth, bareheaded, with a full head of glossy raven hair, and his eyes like some mad animal flashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange calmness, holds aloft in one hand a large knife\u2014walks along not much back from the footlights, turns fully towards the audience his face of statuesque beauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation, perhaps insanity\u2014launches out in a firm and steady voice the words, Sic semper tyrannis \u2014and then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage, and disappears\u2026(Had not all this terrible scene\u2014making the mimic ones preposterous\u2014had it not all been rehears'd in blank, by Booth, beforehand?)</p><p>A moment's hush, incredulous\u2014a scream\u2014the cry of murder. Mrs. Lincoln leaning out of the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry, pointing to the retreating figure, He has killed the President\u2026 And still a moment's strange, incredulous suspense\u2014and then the deluge!\u2014then that mixture of horror, noises, uncertainty\u2014the sound, somewhere back, of a horse's hoofs clattering with speed\u2014the people burst through chairs and railings, and break them up\u2014that noise adds to the queerness of the scene\u2014there is inextricable confusion and terror\u2014women faint\u2014quite feeble persons fall and are trampled on\u2014many cries of agony are heard\u2014the broad stage suddenly fills to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible carnival\u2014the audience rush generally upon it, at least the strong men do\u2014the actors and actresses are all there in their play costumes and painted faces, with mortal fright showing through the rouge; some trembling, some in tears\u2014the screams and calls, confused talk\u2014redoubled, trebled\u2014two or three manage to pass up water from the stage to the President's box\u2014others try to clamber up, etc., etc., etc.</p><p>In the midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's Guard, with others, suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in (some two hundred altogether)\u2014they storm the house, through all the tiers, especially the upper ones, inflamed with fury, literally charging the audience with fixed bayonets, muskets and pistols, shouting 'Clear out! clear out! you sons of\u2014\u2014\u2014.' Such the wild scene, or a suggestion of it rather, inside the play-house that night.</p><p>. . . . . . .</p><p>And in the midst of that night-pandemonium of senseless hate, infuriated soldiers, the audience and the crowd\u2014the stage and all its actors and actresses, its paint-pots, spangles, and gas lights\u2014the life-blood from those veins, the best and sweetest of the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze already begins its little bubbles on the lips\u2026. Such, hurriedly sketched, were the accompaniments of the death of President Lincoln. So suddenly, and in murder and horrors unsurpassed, he was taken from us. But his death was painless.</p><p>Such descriptive power as this would of right entitle Walt Whitman to place and name among the sons of men; and it is this, and such as this, which make the faults that must undoubtedly be admitted\u2014among others, and perhaps most flagrant, the idle and unnecessary dislike of the poet to 'old romance,' to 'novels, plots, and plays of foreign courts,' and worst of all to 'love-verses sugar'd in rhyme'\u2014seem comparatively unimportant. Could he apply this power to the whole as to this one chapter, Walt Whitman might abandon all other titles for that of America's first historian.</p>", "date": "October 21 1876", "year": 1876, "creator": "J.

There has been no English edition, and so far as the present writer knows, nothing has been said about it in any of the Reviews. Yet this book contains, perhaps, the best defence of Democracy which has been offered of late years, some of the truest poetry, and not a few arrowy sayings, which, if they have not pierced the core of the great problems which have eternally troubled humanity, have at any rate penetrated them profoundly.</p><p>'The Two Rivulets' consists of prose and verse. The prose is made up of an essay called 'Democratic Vistas,' and of memoranda written during the great Civil War of the States. The author was a volunteer in the hospitals, and he tells us his experiences in the wards and in the camps. The verse, with one or two exceptions, is unmetrical and unrhymed, in the same style as the 'Leaves of Grass.' No man more clearly than Whitman has seen the seamy side of Republicanism, as it is presented in the United States. At times his faith in the people has apparently been altogether shattered, and passages might be cited which, taken by themselves, would lead us to believe that he is without hope. He sees 'the chaotic confusion of labour in the Southern States, the growing and alarming spectacle of countless squads of vagabond children, the hideousness and squalor of certain quarters of the cities; the advent of late years, with increasing frequency, of these pompous, nauseous, outside shows of vulgar wealth,' and what he calls his 'darkest dread,' the decay of the 'simple, unsophisticated conscience, the primary moral element.' 'Our triumphant modern civilisee,' he proclaims, 'with his all-schooling and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains.'</p><p>'The underlying principles of the States are not honestly believed in (for all this hectic glow and these melodramatic screamings), nor is humanity itself believed in. What penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask? The spectacle is appalling. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. The men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful superciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the litt\u00e9rateurs is to find something to make fun of. A lot of churches, sects, &c., the most dismal phantasms I know, usurp the name of religion. Conversation is a mass of badinage. From deceit in the spirit, the mother of all false deeds, the offspring is already incalculable. An acute and candid person in the Revenue department at Washington, who is led by the course of his employment to regularly visit the cities, north, south, and west, to investigate frauds, has talked much with me (1869, 1870) about his discoveries. The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The whole of the official services of America, national, State, and municipal, in all their branches and departments, except the Judiciary, are steeped, saturated, in corruption, bribery, falsehood, maladministrations; and the Judiciary is tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In fashionable life, flippancy, tepid amours, weak infidelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time\u2026 I say that our New World Democracy, however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic-development products, and in a certain highly deceptive, superficial, popular intellectuality, is so far an almost complete failure in its social aspects, in any superb, general-personal character, and in really grand, religious, moral, literary and \u00e6sthetic results.'</p><p>Nevertheless, on the whole, his doubts are over-mastered, and, as against any other form of government, he decides for self-government. He believes</p><p>'the ulterior object of political and all other government (having, of course, provided for the police, the safety of life, property, and for the basic statute and common law, and their administration, always first in order) to be among the rest, not merely to rule and to repress disorder, but to develop, to open up to cultivation, to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly outcroppage, and of that aspiration for independence and the pride and self-respect latent in all characters (or if there be exceptions, we cannot, fixing our eyes on them alone, make theirs the rule for all). I say the mission of government henceforth, in civilised lands, is not repression alone, and not authority alone, not even of law, nor by that favourite standard of the eminent writer (Carlyle), the rule of the best men, the born heroes and captains of the race (as if such ever, or one time out of a hundred, get into the big places, elective or dynastic!), but higher than the highest arbitrary rule, to train communities through all their grades, beginning with individuals and ending there again, to rule themselves.'</p><p>'What Christ appeared for in the moral-spiritual field for humankind\u2014namely, that in respect to the absolute soul there is, in the possession of such by each single individual, something so transcendent, or incapable of gradations (like life), that, to that extent, it places all beings on a common level, utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect, virtue, or station, or any height or lowliness whatever, is tallied in like manner, in this other field, by Democracy's rule, that men, the nation, as a common aggregate of living identities, affording in each a separate and complete subject for freedom, worldly thrift, and happiness, and for a fair chance for growth, and for protection in citizenship, &c. must to the political extent of the suffrage or vote, if no further, be placed, in each and in the whole, on one broad, primary, universal, common platform.'</p><p>Walt Whitman's creed in this matter has been largely shaped by the war. He found the average American in the United States' armies, under pressure of want, disease, danger, and at one time in presence of failure, to be nobler than a mere glance at the outside of political life would have reported him to be. He records with joy that once, when he stood by the bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier, who lay conscious of approaching death, yet perfectly calm 'and with noble spiritual manner,' an old surgeon observed that 'he had not seen yet the first case of man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror.' He insists on the grandeur of the great uprising of the people for the sake of an idea, and the equally grand spectacle of the peaceful disbanding of the gigantic armies, and their absorption, without a word, into the ranks of the citizens. Lastly, he is convinced that, whatever follies Democracy may commit, owing mainly to its indifference, there resides in it a power of enthusiastic self-assertion on all great occasions when appeal is fairly made to it.</p><p>This is but a poor and brief account of Whitman's argument. The subject is one too large for discussion in a couple of columns; but those who care for it, if they turn to the 'Democratic Vistas,' will assuredly find that Whitman's plea is not school logic nor mere vapouring, but that it is from himself, and that every line has life in it.</p><p>After reading Whitman's poetry, we are apt to condemn nine-tenths of modern poetry as nothing but jingle. Some of his verses, like 'After the Sea Ship,' for example, are merely expressive of nature\u2014that is to say, a natural phenomenon, commonplace enough, is selected, described, and set in a frame. But we recognise a peculiar charm\u2014the charm of the picture, the secret of all art, and we say to ourselves, the man who takes anything which lies around us unnoticed, and holds it up to us as something worthy of admiration; who signalises its special beauty; who gives it voice; who acts as the tongue of the dumb world to us, is one of our greatest benefactors. Whitman never leaves the Present for the Past, in order to find his romance. He is utterly free from that miserable modern sentimentality which discerns nothing in our own time worth seeing, but must take all its subjects from a century, or ten centuries, or twenty centuries ago; a sentimentality morally pernicious, because, under its influence, life passes away like a dream, all the messages of the Present lying entirely disregarded. To Whitman the nineteenth century is emphatically the century for him; and he is not afraid even to write an ode to a locomotive. The poetry of the present epoch is infected with a scepticism worse than anything ever condemned by council or synod. It parades before us a weak despair, an insistence on the irreconcileable in nature, the parting of friends never to meet again, the obliteration of the landscape by the advancing ugliness of cities, the insolubility of the riddles of life, death, and the infinite. The trick, for trick it is, is easy enough. Every man with the least capacity for anything beyond the pleasures of the senses is full enough of such stuff as this; but he ought to consider himself bound not to speak it. Unless he can help his fellow creatures to courage and to faith, let him hold his tongue. Whitman refuses to be cowed even by death.</p><p>'O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?<br>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,<br>To adorn the burial house of him I love?<br>Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,<br>With the fourth-month eve at sundown, and the grey smoke <br>lurid and bright,<br>With floods of the yellow gold, and the gorgeous, indolent, <br>sinking sun burning, expanding the air;<br>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale, green <br>leaves of the trees prolific,<br>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, <br>with a wind-dapple here and there;<br>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against <br>the sky, and shadows;<br>And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of <br>chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the work-<br>men homeward returning.'</p><p>He believes that thought will be its own cure; that if we are afflicted by doubt, we must not hesitate\u2014least of all must we stop short and hide ourselves in a fiction; but that we must go forward.</p><p>'O my brave soul!<br>O farther, farther sail!<br>O daring joy, but safe! Are they not all the seas of God?<br>O farther, farther, farther sail!'</p><p>The reader of 'The Two Rivulets' will notice, what was so obvious in the Leaves of Grass, a determination to make men satisfied with their own lives. Whitman does not teach that life is to be reckoned by a few consummate moments, to which we are to look back, or for which we are to wait. He sings the sweetness of common occupations. He knows that in mere life itself there is something, there is much that is good, and that we must find our happiness in the common day's work, relationships, and visitations, unless we wish our existence to be excavated, a mere hollow reminiscence or anticipation.</p><p>Finally, he holds that it is possible for man, even in his last extremity, to preserve his serenity, and still to hope. It is almost murder to mutilate his exquisite 'Prayer of Columbus' by not quoting it entire; but nevertheless, the closing verses must be given by way of illustrating the sublimity of his faith:\u2014</p><p>'One effort more\u2014my altar this bleak sand;<br>That thou, O God, my life hast lighted,<br>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of thee<br>(Light rare, untellable\u2014lighting the very light!<br>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages)!<br>For that, O God\u2014be it my latest word,here on my knees,<br>Old, poor, and paralysed\u2014I thank thee.</p><p>'My terminus near,<br>The clouds already closing in upon me,<br>The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,<br>I yield my ships to thee ,<br>Steersman unseen! henceforth the helms are thine;<br>Take thou command\u2014what to my petty skill thy naviga-<br>tion?</p><p>'My hands, my limbs, grow nerveless;<br>My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd;<br>Let the old timbers part,I will not part;<br>I will cling fast to thee, O God, though the waves buffet <br>me\u2014<br>Thee, thee, at least, I know.</p><p>'Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?<br>What do I know of life? What of myself?<br>I know not even my own work, past or present;<br>Dim, ever shifting guesses of it spread before me,<br>Of nearer, better worlds; their mighty parturition<br>Mocking, perplexing me.'</p><p>'And these things I see suddenly\u2014what mean they?<br>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes:<br>Shadowy, vast shapes smile through the air and sky;<br>And on the distant waves sail countless ships;<br>And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.'</p><p>In this 'Prayer of Columbus' Whitman has reached the highest point of self-negation\u2014a point which it seems sometimes impossible to attain. It is almost beyond us to be able to say: 'I am perfectly content if only the evolution goes on which my existence has helped. Whatever may happen to me\u2014whether I live or die; whether our immortality be a truth or a figment\u2014I am altogether resigned and happy.' It is clear that this must be the goal of our ethics; and, until we have overcome even to that end, we shall be the victims of unceasing despairs. Till then we build on illusions, which for a moment seem to possess reality, and presently vanish, mocking our hopes.</p><p>If a motto were to be chosen for 'The Two Rivulets,' and for Walt Whitman generally, it should be that noble sentence from the preface to 'The Hesperus' of Jean Paul:\u2014</p><p>'The stones and rocks, which two veiled shapes, necessity and sin, like Deucalion and Pyrrha, throw behind them at the good, shall become new men.</p><p>'And on the western gate of this century stands written:</p><p>'Here is the road to Virtue and Wisdom.'</p><p>Just as on the western gate of Cherson stood the sublime inscription\u2014</p><p>'Here leads the way to Byzantium.</p><p>Infinite Providence, thou wilt make the day dawn.''</p><p>W.

Whitman's New Poem", "body": "<p><strong>Walt. Whitman's New Poem.</strong></p><p>The author of Leaves of Grass has perpetrated another 'poem.' The N. Y. Saturday Press, in whose columns, we regret to say, it appears, calls it 'a curious warble.' Curious, it may be; but warble it is not, in any sense of that mellifluous word. It is a shade less heavy and vulgar than the Leaves of Grass, whose unmitigated badness seemed to cap the climax of poetic nuisances. But the present performance has all the emptiness, without half the grossness, of the author's former efforts.</p><p>How in the name of all the Muses this so-called 'poem' ever got into the columns of the Saturday Press, passes our poor comprehension. We had come to look upon that journal as the prince of literary weeklies, the arbiter elegantiarum of dramatic and poetic taste, into whose well filled columns nothing stupid or inferior could intrude. The numerous delicious poems; the sparkling bons mots; the puns, juicy and classical, which almost redeemed that vicious practice, and raised it to the rank of a fine art; the crisp criticisms, and delicate dramatic humors of Personne, and the charming piquancies of the spirituelle Ada Clare - all united to make up a paper of rare excellence. And it is into this gentle garden of the Muses that that unclean cub of the wilderness, WALT WHITMAN, has been suffered to intrude, trampling with his vulgar and profane hoofs among the delicate flowers which bloom there, and soiling the spotless white of its fair columns with lines of stupid and meaningless twaddle.</p><p>Perhaps our readers are blissfully ignorant of the history and achievements of Mr. Walt Whitman. Be it known, then, that he is a native and resident of Brooklyn, Long Island, born and bred in an obscurity from which it were well that he never had emerged. A person of coarse nature, and strong, rude passions, he has passed his life in cultivating, not the amenities, but the rudeness of character; and instead of tempering his native ferocity with the delicate influences of art and refined literature, he has studied to exaggerate his deformities, and to thrust into his composition all the brute force he could muster from a capacity not naturally sterile in the elements of strength. He has undertaken to be an artist, without learning the first principle of art, and has presumed to put forth 'poems,' without possessing a spark of the poetic faculty. He affects swagger and independence, and blurts out his vulgar impertinence under a full assurance of 'originality.'</p><p>In his very first performance, this truculent tone was manifested. He exaggerated every sentiment, and piled up with endless repetition every epithet, till the reader grew weary, even to nausea, of his unmeaning rant. He announced himself to the world as a new and striking thinker, who had something to reveal. His Leaves of Grass were a revelation from the Kingdom of Nature. Thus he screams to a gaping universe:</p><p>'I, Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Cosmos; I shout my voice high and clear over the waves; I send my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>Such was the style of his performance, only it was disfigured by far worse sins of morality than of taste. Never, since the days of RABELAIS was there such literature of uncleanness as some portions of this volume exhibited. All that is beautiful and sacred in love was dragged down to the brutal plane of animal passion, and the writer appeared to revel in language fit only for the lips of the PRIAPUS of the old mythology.</p><p>We had hoped that the small reception accorded to his first performance had deterred Mr. WHITMAN from fresh trespasses in the realms of literature. Several years had passed away, his worse than worthless book had been forgotten, and we hoped that this Apollo of the Brooklyn marshes had returned to his native mud. But we grieve to say he revived last week, and although somewhat changed, changed very little for the better. We do not find so much that is offensive, but we do find a vast amount of irreclaimable drivel and inexplicable nonsense.</p><p>We have searched this 'poem' through with a serious and deliberate endeavor to find out the reason of its being written; to discover some clue to the mystery of so vast an expenditure of words. But we honestly confess our utter inability to solve the problem. It is destitute of all the elements which are commonly desiderated in poetical composition; it has neither rhythm nor melody, rhyme nor reason, metre nor sense. We do solemnly assert, that there is not to be discovered, throughout the whole performance, so much as the glimmering ghost of an idea. Here is the poem, which the author, out of his characteristic perversity, insists upon calling the pre-verse:</p><p>'Out of the rocked cradle.<br>Out of the mocking bird's throat, the musical shuttle,<br>Out of the boy's mother's womb, and from the nipples<br>of her breasts,<br>Out of the Ninth-Month midnight,<br>Over the sterile sea-sands, and the field beyond,where <br>the child, leaving his bed, wandered alone, bare- <br>headed, barefoot,<br>Down from the showered halo and the moonbeams,<br>Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twist- <br>ing as if they were alive,<br>Out from the patches of briars and blackberries,<br>From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,<br>From your memories, sad brother - from the fitful ris- <br>ings and fallings I heard,<br>From that night, infantile, under the yellow half-moon,<br> late risen, and swollen as if with tears,<br>From those beginning notes of sickness and love, there<br> in the mist,<br>From the thousand responses in my heart, never to <br>cease,<br>From the myriad thence-aroused words,<br>From the word stronger and more delicious than any,<br>From such, as now they start, the scene revisiting,<br>As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,<br>Borne hither - ere all eludes me, hurriedly,<br>A man - yet by these tears a little boy again,<br>Throwing myself on the sand, I,<br>Confronting the waves, sing.'</p><p>This is like nothing we ever heard of in literature, unless it be the following lucid and entertaining composition:</p><p>'Once there was an old woman went into the garden to get some cabbage to make an apple pie. Just then a great she-bear comes up and pops his head into the shop. 'What, no soap!' So he died, and she married the barber; and there was present at the wedding the Jicaninies and the Picaninies, and the Grand Panjandrum himself, with a little round button at the top; and they all fell to playing the game of catch as catch can, till the gun powder ran out of the heels of their boots.'</p><p>The 'poem' goes on, after the same maudlin manner, for a hundred lines or more, in which the interjection 'O' is employed above five-and-thirty times, until we reach the following gem:</p><p>'Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was be- <br>fore; what there, in the night,<br>By the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon.<br>The dusky demon aroused, the fire, the sweet hell with- <br>in<br>The unknown want, the destiny of me.'</p><p>Oh, but this is bitter bad!</p><p>'O give me some clue!<br>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!<br>O a word! O what is my destination?<br>O I fear it is henceforth chaos!'</p><p>There is not a doubt of it, we do assure you! And what is more, it never was anything else. Now, what earthly object can there be in writing and printing such unmixed and hopeless drivel as that? If there were any relief to the unmeaning monotony, some glimpse of fine fancy, some oasis of sense, some spark of 'the vision and the faculty divine,' we would not say a word. But we do protest, in the name of the sanity of the human intellect, against being invited to read such stuff as this, by its publication in the columns of a highly respectable literary journal. What is the comment of the Saturday Press itself on the 'poem'? It says:</p><p>'Like the Leaves of Grass, the purport of this wild and plaintive song, well enveloped, and eluding definition, is positive and unquestionable, like the effect of music. The piece will bear reading many times - perhaps, indeed, only comes forth, as from recesses, by many repetitions.'</p><p>Well, Heaven help us, then, for as we are a living man, we would not read that poem 'many times' for all the poetry that was ever perpetrated since the morning stars sang together. 'Well enveloped, and eluding definition.' Indeed! We should think so. For our part, we hope it will remain 'well enveloped' till doomsday; and as for 'definition,' all we can do in that direction is to declare that either that 'poem' is nonsense, or we are a lunatic.</p><p>If any of the tuneful Nine have ever descended upon Mr. Walt Whitman, it must have been long before that gentleman reached the present sphere of existence.

All of which is respectfully submitted as outset for something else made way to be said, namely:</p><p>We feel authorized to announce, for certain, that the Mocking-Bird, having come to his throat again, his cantabile, is not going to give cause to his admirers for complaining that he idles, mute, any more, up and down the world. His songs, in one and another direction, will, he promises us, after this date, profusely appear.</p><p>We are able to declare that there will also soon crop out the true 'LEAVES OF GRASS,' the fuller- grown work of which the former two issues were the inchoates\u2014this forthcoming one, far, very far ahead of them in quality, quantity, and in supple lyric exuberance.</p><p>Those former issues, published by the author himself in little pittance-editions, on trial, have just dropped the book enough to ripple the inner first-circles of literary agitation, in immediate contact with it. The outer, vast, extending, and ever-wider-extending circles, of the general supply, perusal, and discussion of such a work, have still to come. The market needs to-day to be supplied\u2014the great West especially\u2014with copious thousands of copies.</p><p>Indeed, 'LEAVES OF GRASS' has not yet been really published at all. Walt Whitman, for his own purposes, slowly trying his hand at the edifice, the structure he has undertaken, has lazily loafed on, letting each part have time to set\u2014evidently building not so much with reference to any part itself, considered alone, but more with reference to the ensemble,\u2014always bearing in mind the combination of the whole, to fully justify the parts when finished.</p><p>Of course the ordinary critic, even of good eye, high intellectual calibre, and well accomplished, grasps not, sees not, any such ideal ensemble\u2014likely sees not the only valuable part of these mystic leaves, namely, not what they state, but what they infer\u2014scornfully wants to know what the Mocking-Bird means, who can tell?\u2014gives credit only for what is proved to the surface-ear\u2014and makes up a very fine criticism, not out of the soul, to which these poems altogether appeal, and by which only they can be interpreted, but out of the intellect, to which Walt Whitman has not, as far as we remember, addressed one single word in the whole course of his writings.</p><p>Then the workmanship, the art-statement and argument of the question. Is this man really any artist at all? Or not plainly a sort of naked and hairy savage, come among us, with yelps and howls, disregarding all our lovely metrical laws? How can it be that he offends so many and so much?</p><p>Quite after the same token as the Italian Opera, to most bold Americans, and all new persons, even of latent proclivities that very way, only accustomed to tunes, piano-noises and the performances of the negro bands\u2014satisfied, (or rather fancying they are satisfied), with each and several thereof, from association and habit, until they pass utterly beyond them\u2014which comes in good time, and cannot be deferred much longer, either, in such a race as yours, O bold American of the West!</p><p>Walt Whitman's method in the construction of his songs is strictly the method of the Italian Opera, which, when heard, confounds the new person aforesaid, and, as far as he can then see, showing no purport for him, nor on the surface, nor any analogy to his previous-accustomed tunes, impresses him as if all the sounds of earth and hell were tumbled promiscuously together. Whereupon he says what he candidly thinks (or supposes he thinks), and is very likely a first-rate fellow\u2014with room to grow, in certain directions.</p><p>Then, in view of the latter words, bold American! in the ardor of youth, commit not yourself, too irretrievably, that there is nothing in the Italian composers, and nothing in the Mocking-Bird's chants. But pursue them awhile\u2014listen\u2014yield yourself\u2014persevere. Strange as the shape of the suggestion may be, perhaps such free strains are to give to these United States, or commence giving them, the especial nourishments which, though all solid and mental and moral things are in boundless profusion provided, have hardly yet begun to be provided for them\u2014hardly yet the idea of that kind of nourishment thought of, or the need of it suspected. Though it is the sweetest, strongest meat\u2014pabulum of a race of giants\u2014true pabulum of the children of the prairies.</p><p>You, bold American! and ye future two hundred millions of bold Americans, can surely never live, for instance, entirely satisfied and grow to your full stature, on what the importations hither of foreign bards, dead or alive, provide\u2014nor on what is echoing here the letter and the spirit of the foreign bards. No, bold American! not even on what is provided, printed from Shakespeare or Milton\u2014not even of the Hebrew canticles\u2014certainly not of Pope, Byron, or Wordsworth\u2014nor of any German or French singer, nor any foreigner at all.</p><p>We are to accept those and every other literary and poetic thing from beyond the seas, thankfully, as studies, exercises. We go back\u2014we pause long with the old, ever-modern one, the Homer, the only chanting mouth that approaches our case near enough to raise a vibration, an echo. We then listen with accumulated eagerness for those mouths that can make the vaults of America ring here to-day\u2014those who will not only touch our case, but embody it and all that belongs to it\u2014sing it with varied and powerful idioms, and in the modern spirit, at least as capable, as loud and proud as the best spirit that has ever preceded us.</p><p>Our own song, free, joyous, and masterful. Our own music, raised on the soil, carrying with it all the subtle analogies of our own associations\u2014broad with the broad continental scale of the New World and full of the varied products of its varied soils\u2014composite\u2014comprehensively Religious\u2014Democratic\u2014the red life-blood of Love, warming, running through every line, every word. Ah, if this Walt Whitman, as he keeps on, should ever succeed in presenting such music, such a poem, an identity, emblematic, in the regions of creative art, of the wondrous all-America, material and moral, he would indeed do something.</p><p>And if he don't, the Mocking-Bird may at least have the satisfaction of dying in a good cause.

Accordingly, the desired hour having arrived, I opened the PRESS, and enquired of Mrs. U. what she knew of Walt Whitman, and I am happy to say,\u2014happy, after reading what the Cincinnati paper says about his 'Leaves of Grass,'\u2014that she instantly disclaimed the remotest acquaintance with any one of that name.

No two of them would go the same way, and when they did, it was not the way I wanted them to go. The only consentaneous movement which they seemed at all disposed to execute, was a spasmodic, unsolicited, and uncontrollable flight ad astra, in which my head foolishly refused to participate, and for its contumacy was left behind, the stars being so obliging as to come down in dazzling throngs to gaze upon my helplessness. I remembered the story of Miller at Lundy's Lane, of Bruce (was it?) and the historical Spider, who tried twenty times before he hauled himself up, and I didn't give it up so, O Editor! but 'tried, tried again,' until I believe the closed-up sutures in my cranium were opened as widely as if the brains were out, and a pint of white beans were in with the whole caput-al arrangement-soaking in the Anatomist's basin.

Cobb has very little credit for corn, and the alliterative names of poetesses that so copiously illustrate our literature are believed to have achieved the noblest immortality they deserve, when conferred upon a fast trotting mare, or painted upon a stern-wheel steamer. It is the fashion, among certain of the elect, to look with contempt upon all the reading that really has a purpose in it\u2014that feeds the life of the people directly, with food honestly adapted to their wants. Now it may be submitted that, to a man of culture, or to a man who has seen much of life, the florid style that so wins the popular eye is offensive. Yet that writing has its mission. It educates men to better reading. Less vivid coloring and less extravagant forms would fail to attract the insensitive eyes of the multitude. Once attracted and once fastened, they learn to detect the true among the false, and grow into likelier likings and juster judgments.</p><p>But the real nonsense of literature is not written for the people; it is written for men of culture by men of culture. The most insignificant stuff that ever was uttered has made its appearance in first class journals, and, by its position, claimed for itself consideration and admiration. 'Brahma' will be recalled as a poem that was issued in the first number of the Atlantic Monthly. It was stared at, talked about, travestied, paraphrased, parodied, admired, ridiculed, stuffed, and treated with the most flattering consideration. Why? Because it appeared in a first class magazine, and was said to have been written by a first class man. Was there anything in it? Did ever a man get one idea out of it? Had it a mission in the world of mind? Nothing of the kind. It was an imposition upon the good sense of the public. Every man who threw down the poem after his unsatisfactory perusal of it, with the thought that there was a profound idea in it that he could not comprehend, was cheated and injured by it. It is wrong to thrust such unmeaning twaddle before the eyes of a public, earnestly seeking for a true culture,\u2014to impress that public with the thought that there is wisdom in it, and that they are fools if they fail to find it. There is no medium like a very respectable magazine with very respectable contributors for transmuting inconsequential nonsense into incomprehensible sense.</p><p>But we had nearly forgotten 'Brahma,' and were only reminded of it by the appearance in the last number of the Atlantic of a string of nonsense for which one Walt. Whitman is responsible before the fact of publication. This poem is called 'Bardic Symbols,' if poem that may be which has neither rhythm nor rhyme. Walt. Whitman stands on the shore of Ocean, and says:\u2014</p><p>'Elemental drifts!<br>Oh, I wish I could impress others as you and the <br>waves have just been impressing me!'</p><p>In these two opening lines we are admitted at once into the music of the poem, the unsophisticated character of the writer, and his desires and intentions concerning the reader. This is his first effort at 'impressing others':\u2014</p><p>'As I ebbed with an ebb of the ocean of life,<br>As I wended the shores I know,<br>As I walked where the sea-ripples wash you Pau-<br>manok,<br>Where they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,<br>Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her <br>castaways,<br>I, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off south-<br>ward,<br>Alone, held by the eternal self of me, that threatens<br> to get the better of me, and stifle me,<br>Was seized by the spirit that trails in the lines under-<br>foot,<br>In the ruin, the sediment, that stands for all the wa-<br>ter and all the land of the globe.'</p><p>What a tremendous fix the author must have been in at the fearful moment when, held by that eternal self of him, which threatened to be too much for him, and floor him utterly, he was seized by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot! Poor fellow! No wonder that he subsequently exclaims:\u2014</p><p>'Oh, baffled, lost,<br>Bent to the very earth, here preceding what follows,<br>Terrified with myself that I have dared to open my <br>mouth,<br>Aware now, that, amid all the blab whose echoes re-<br>coil upon me, I have not once had the least idea <br>who or what I am,<br>But that before all my insolent poems the real me <br>stands still untouched, untold, altogether unreached,<br>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratula-<br>tory signs and bows,<br>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word <br>I have written or shall write,<br>Striking me with insults, till I fall helpless upon the <br>sand!'</p><p>The stanza that follows this exhibition of the most extraordinary and unjustifiable conduct on the part of the 'real me' is full of pathos, and quite as full of truth:\u2014</p><p>'Oh, I think I have not understood anything,\u2014not a <br>single object,\u2014and that no man ever can!'</p><p>Reader, the Atlantic Monthly, the best of American magazines, publishes two pages and a half of this stuff, and for what? For its literary merit?\u2014it is a chaos of unmeaning words and a wilderness of bad grammar. For its thought? There is not a well-defined thought in it. For any hint of 'bardic symbols?' There is not a new one in it. The whole performance is execrable\u2014a mass of half-crazy, half-idiotic nonsense, and, considered as a literary production, is a disgrace to the journal which gave it birth. If this production had appeared, word for word, in some modest country paper, it would had been seized upon at once by the press as a theme for immeasurable fun, like Mr. Tenney's immortal Fourth of July Oration. Yet, because some philosopher of the accepted stamp has indorsed the writer of this, and it has appeared in a magazine presided over by an excellent mind, it becomes respectable, and is blindly supposed to have excellencies, could they only be detected and measured.</p><p>There is something in the slang phrase 'good horse sense' which we like. It is a kind of sense which discards this whole class of productions\u2014the mystical, the affectedly homely, the dreamily rhapsodical, the enigmatical\u2014as things of no value, when, by the circumstances which accompany them, they fail to be things of mischief.

Now he is in the Atlantic, with a poem more lawless, measureless, rhymeless and inscrutable than ever.</p><p>No one, even after the fourth or fifth reading, can pretend to say what the 'Bardic Symbols' symbolize.

All is confusion, waste and sound. It is in vain that you attempt to gather the poet's full meaning from what he says or what he hints. You can only take refuge in occasional passages like this, in which he wildly laments the feebleness and inefficiency of that art which above all others seeks to make the soul visible and audible:</p><p>O, baffled, lost,<br>Bent to the very earth, here preceding what follows,<br>Terrified with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,<br>Aware now, that amid all the blab, whose echoes recoil <br>upon me, I have not once had the least idea who or <br>what I am,<br><em>But that before all my insolent poems the real one still stands <br>untouched, untold, altogether unreached, </em><br>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory <br>signs and bows,<br>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I <br>have written or shall write,<br>Striking me with insults till I fall helpless upon the sand.</p><p>If indeed, we were compelled to guess the meaning of the poem, we should say it all lay in the compass of these lines of Tennyson\u2014the saddest and profoundest that ever were written:</p><p>Break, break, break,<br>On thy cold gray stones, O sea!<br>And I would that my tongue could utter<br>The thoughts that arise in me!</p><p>An aspiration of mute words without relevancy, without absolute signification, and full of 'divine despair.'</p><p>We think it has been an error in Whitman to discard forms and laws, for without them the poet diffuses.
